Carbon pawprint A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.","The years leading up to 2025 were marked by a rare optimism that the United States would finally do something about climate change. Former president Joe Biden called the crisis an “enormous opportunity,” and during his term, Congress passed the biggest climate law in the country’s history. It felt like the U.S. was on the cusp of a greener future — until that momentum came to a sudden halt.

As soon as President Donald Trump took office in January, he brought a swift end to that era with an all-out assault on his predecessor’s policies, unraveling environmental protections and canceling climate research. Trump abandoned global climate commitments while aggressively promoting fossil fuels at home, even as the rest of the world installed more solar panels and wind turbines than ever before.

There’s a word for this kind of reactionary response: greenlash, a social and political backlash against efforts to rein in emissions. In Trump’s second term, climate change became a politically radioactive word: Phrases including “clean energy,” “climate science,” and “pollution” began disappearing from government websites.

And people around the country took the cue. Corporations got quiet about their climate plans. Democratic politicians steered clear of phrases like “planetary emergency.” Media coverage of the climate crisis thinned. That all trickled down to everyday Americans, who say they’re hearing less than they used to about climate change on social media and from the people they know.

While greenlash might sound like a very American phenomenon, it actually took off in Europe. The EU was an early adopter of comprehensive climate policies, and also saw the first big wave of greenlash. That opposition was mainly driven by specific economic burdens — Germany’s plan to switch to energy-efficient heat pumps caused an uproar as homeowners worried about the costs, for example. In the United States, the greenlash gathered more fuel from Trump-style populism and the culture wars.

With a tumultuous 2025 coming to an end, dictionary editors have been digging through the lexicon for words that capture its spirit. Their picks — “AI slop,” “rage bait,” and the essentially meaningless phrase “6-7” — point to a world that’s very online, and not doing much better for it. For us at Grist, greenlash stood out as the word of the year, marking a moment when climate change was yanked off the political priority list.

The mood might have shifted, but people in the U.S. are about as concerned about climate change as they’ve ever been, with about two-thirds saying they’re worried. The consequences of a warming planet were on full display this year, from the horrific fires that burned through Los Angeles neighborhoods in January to the rains that drenched Texas in July, causing the deadliest flash flooding in the country in half a century. It was also a turbulent time for the politics of climate change, a trend reflected in these words and phrases that captured the zeitgeist.

Carbon pawprint

A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.

A host of articles this year highlighted how cats and dogs have an outsized carbon pawprint — and, wow, pet owners got worked up about it. The chief culprit is the meat-heavy diets they feed their pets, with beef in particular emitting a lot of methane, a powerful, planet-warming gas. The conversation really kicked into gear this summer with a headline from The Associated Press: “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.” The dog ownership question was only a tiny part of that study, which investigated how people rank the climate impact of various personal actions, like going vegan or using public transit. But the headline’s focus blew up on Reddit, where people complained that focusing on individual responsibility instead of big, systemic changes missed the point. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one user wrote sarcastically.

Cheap energy

A Democratic messaging slogan linking clean energy with lower costs for consumers.

Hoping to reach Americans more concerned about rising electricity bills than the upward march of global temperatures, Democrats have been talking more and more about how clean energy is cheap energy. After getting trounced in the 2024 election, many Democratic politicians turned to polling to see what had gone wrong. One theory was that they spent too much time talking about social issues like climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, putting them out of step with voters who cared more about affordability and health care. As one new think tank, the Searchlight Institute, summed it up: “Don’t say climate change.” Climate champions in Congress aren’t avoiding the topic entirely, but selling climate-friendly policies as a strategy to lower the cost of living instead. In September, for instance, two Democratic representatives, Sean Casten and Mike Levin, introduced the “Cheap Energy Agenda.” There’s some evidence the pivot might be working, after Democrats notched wins in November’s off-year election in races where energy costs played an important role.

Critical minerals

Raw materials that are crucial for modern technology, but in limited supply.

It was hard to avoid the phrase critical minerals in 2025, when it moved from policy jargon to the headlines. These metals — including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and so-called “rare earths” — are essential for building solar panels and the batteries that power electric vehicles and e-bikes. The Trump administration has been aggressively chasing these metals as part of its national security strategy, hoping to secure the vital ingredients for making everything from smartphones to high-tech military technologies. Trump signed executive orders calling for more mining of critical minerals and fast-tracked permits for new projects, while also setting his sights on procuring more supply abroad by negotiating deals in Ukraine, central Africa, and across Asia. Stocks for some rare-earth mining companies have more than tripled this year as critical minerals got hyped up. Some experts think that the future of geopolitics will be more defined by these critical metals than by oil.

Energy dominance

A slogan-turned-policy-goal emphasizing fossil fuel production and American power.

When Trump signed an executive order on Inauguration Day aimed at “unleashing energy dominance,” the phrase left experts scratching their heads. It soon became clear it had everything to do with maximizing the production of oil, gas, and coal in order to gain leverage over other countries. It certainly had nothing to do with dominating the market for renewable energy. Experts told Grist that the phrase seems to be more about vibes than specific policy goals. It taps into a nostalgia for what fossil fuels once promised — optimism, growth, and a certain ideal of masculine work. This kind of chest-beating reaction to industrial decline and climate change even has a name: “petro-masculinity.”

Green New Scam

A Trumpism that counters climate policy by rebranding the “Green New Deal” as a conspiracy.

The Green New Scam has become the Trump administration’s defining line on efforts to take on climate change. Trump came up with the catchphrase during a rally in New Hampshire in 2023, while riffing on ways to attack Biden’s climate policies. When he landed on “Green New Scam,” the crowd roared with approval, and he sensed he was onto something — even though Congress had never actually passed a Green New Deal. Renee Hobbs, who wrote a book on modern propaganda, told Grist that Trump’s repetition of Green New Scam fits into a classic strategy: “You repeat the phrases that you want to stick, and you downplay, ignore, minimize, or censor the concepts that don’t meet your agenda.”

Rain anxiety

A growing sense of dread triggered by rainfall.

For many people, the sound of raindrops isn’t comforting at all, but terrifying. If you’ve survived a flood, it can bring up traumatic memories, leading to what’s called rain anxiety. “Anyone else getting mildly stressed when it rains a lot?” reads a typical Reddit post on the matter. Floods struck many parts of the U.S. this year — not only Texas, but also New Mexico, Illinois, North Carolina, New York, and Washington state. By mid-year, the National Weather Service had issued almost 4,000 flash-floods alerts, the most for that time period since 1986. About 20 to 30 percent of people who live through flooding develop depression or post-traumatic stress disorder in the months afterward, according to a report from the U.N.’s international panel of climate scientists. There’s a clear connection to climate change: A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, making the idiom “when it rains, it pours” more of a reality than ever before.

USA, Texas, Houston: Giga Energy has announced the opening of its new medium-voltage manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The 5,600 m2 (60,000-sq-ft) plant will serve as the company’s main US site for producing medium-voltage transformers, with production scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026. Annual output is expected to exceed 3,000 units, providing critical electrical infrastructure amid ongoing transformer supply constraints.

At launch, the Houston Factory will create 25 jobs, with plans to expand to nearly 100 as production increases. The facility supports domestic manufacturing and provides faster access to transformers for data centres, renewable energy projects, and industrial power systems.

The plant features advanced manufacturing equipment, including a terahertz drying oven that accelerates moisture removal during transformer production, enhancing consistency and reducing cycle time. Local manufacturing also allows Giga Energy to maintain direct oversight of quality and delivery schedules.

Matt Lohstroh, CEO of Giga Energy, said: “The MV Houston Factory combines advanced manufacturing technology with American-based production to deliver higher quality, faster lead times and new local jobs, all at a moment when the country urgently needs more transformer capacity.”

The MV Houston Factory will also supply transformers for Giga’s development projects, including over 500 MW of electrical infrastructure for AI-focused data centres. This will support both Giga-operated sites and colocation facilities for enterprise and hyperscale AI operators.

The facility is set to play a key role in scaling U.S. transformer production and reinforcing energy infrastructure for data centres, renewable generation, and industrial networks.

It’s been a difficult year for clean energy in America. President Donald Trump entered office in January and promptly stopped the transition away from fossil fuels and toward solar, wind, and batteries in its tracks. Right?

Not quite. In fact, for all of Trump’s paeans to ​“beautiful, clean coal” and to natural gas, it’s clean energy that has once again led the way this year. Through November, 92% of new power capacity added to the grid in 2025 came in the form of solar, wind, or storage, according to Cleanview analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data shared with Canary Media.

That’s in line with figures from recent years. In 2024, 96% of U.S. capacity additions were carbon-free.

This year, solar alone accounted for half of new capacity added to the grid through November, while storage made up 31%. Despite Trump’s all-out assault on wind energy — and his pledge that no ​“windmills” would be built during his term — the energy source has so far accounted for more gigawatts of new electricity than gas turbines have.

It’s worth noting that December is typically the busiest month for new energy deployments in the U.S., so these numbers will look a bit different when the full-year data comes in. It’s also possible that clean-energy deployments are artificially high right now as developers race to complete projects before Trump’s restrictions on lucrative tax credits kick in. And, overall, fossil fuels still generate a much larger share of U.S. electricity than renewables do — even if solar and wind are closing that gap.

Still, the figures underscore the warnings made by energy experts, policymakers, and advocates: The Trump administration is playing with fire by trying to limit the development of solar, battery, and wind energy right when electricity demand is rising at its fastest rate in decades.

These are the quickest sources of energy to deploy. Meanwhile, gas turbines face a supply-chain crunch that is both driving up the cost of some new power plants and making it near impossible to build enough gas facilities to meet new demand, even if climate concerns weren’t a factor.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/cotw-clean-capacity-nov.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=9405f635392e8f848318cf0262be2cc2,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:43.864284

Although youth climate plaintiffs have notched some victories, they have also seen setbacks.","Rikki Held grew up on her family’s ranch in Montana, watching the land transform amid the climate crisis. The Powder River, which runs through the property, has sometimes dried up during drought, leaving crops and livestock without water. At other points, rapid snowmelt and heavy rains have caused flooding and eroded riverbanks, making the land difficult to use.

Two years ago, the 24-year-old and a group of other young people won a groundbreaking legal victory, intended to prevent those impacts from worsening. In August 2023, a judge ruled in favour of plaintiffs in Held v Montana, in which 16 young people accused the state of violating their constitutional rights by promoting planet-warming fossil fuels. The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings late last year, but plaintiffs say lawmakers have since passed new laws that violate that ruling. So last week, they filed a new petition calling on the supreme court to enforce their earlier win, one of several youth-led constitutional climate lawsuits filed in the US this year.

“We have to keep working on cases like these,” Held said. More on this eventful year in youth climate litigation, after this week’s headlines.

In focus

Represented by the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, US youth brought other accountability-focused climate suits in 2025. In May, 22 young Americans sued the Trump administration, alleging that federal officials were violating their constitutional rights with their pro-fossil fuel policies, including moves to declare a “national energy emergency” and “unleash American energy”, and an order aimed at “reinvigorating” the domestic production of coal – the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuel. A judge dismissed the lawsuit this autumn, but the group quickly appealed.

Eva Lighthiser, the 19-year-old named plaintiff in the federal court case, is also involved in the Montana litigation. Its earlier success “reminded me just how important democracy and the power of young voices are,” she said.

“With that in mind, [suing] this current administration was something I approached with confidence in our judicial system and the US constitution,” said Lighthiser.

Young climate plaintiffs also filed cases this year against Wisconsin and Utah. In September, some also submitted a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, claiming the US was violating international law by perpetuating a fossil fuel-based energy system.

The lawsuits face a challenging path. Although youth climate plaintiffs have notched some victories, they have also seen setbacks. Earlier this year, Juliana v United States – perhaps the best-known US youth climate lawsuit, which argued the US was harming youth by perpetuating a fossil-based energy system – ended after wending its way through the court for 10 years, when the supreme court declined to hear an appeal.

But the plaintiffs remain undeterred.

“Young people are inheriting an uncertain future where climate change is only going to continue to worsen, and it feels essential for us to use our voices and take action in [any] way we can,” said Lighthiser.

“When Held was initially filed in 2020, I was too young to vote. As young people, taking to the courts can be our only viable option in regard to participating in democracy.”

A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.",https://www.qcnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/12/694470622b39d5.30442811.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:26.563093

""Generation needs to be near load centres, the way it used to be before there were national power grids, then use HVDC for interconnections.""

Mesh Networks for Reliability

Redundant Grid Design: Implementing mesh networks to build redundancy into the electrical grid, improving reliability and reducing the risk of blackouts.

""Look to mesh networks. Redundancy built in.""

Reduced Car Dependency

Improved Public Transit: Focusing on reducing the number of cars in cities through enhanced public transportation and alternative modes of transport.

""Owning electric cars is no solution for most problems that cars cause in cities... The solution is fewer cars.""

""Mixed traffic streetcars are a complete failure from what I can tell. Worse than busses since they so easily get blocked by cars."" - Highlights the need for dedicated infrastructure for public transit.

Affordable Solar Technology

Low-Cost Solar Panels: Leveraging the production of inexpensive solar panels to make green energy accessible, especially for developing countries and urban areas with poor grid infrastructure.

""China is producing small solar panels at unimaginably low prices, and these solar panels are being distributed in large quantities to developing countries with poor national power grids.""

Vertical Farming

Urban Food Production: While currently uneconomical, vertical farming is seen as a potential future solution for urban food production, which could reduce the energy associated with food transportation.

""Just for the record, vertical farming is a cool idea with a lot of upsides that may become practical in the future if we managed to make some big improvements in our energy system.""

Under the 15-year contract, I&M will purchase electricity from Prairie Creek as part of an all-of-the-above strategy to secure generation in response to surging power demand.

The contracted power from Prairie Creek supports I&M’s efforts to meet the growing energy needs of its customers by diversifying and expanding its generation resources. Once operational, Prairie Creek will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 42,000 homes in Indiana and help ensure I&M customers continue to have access to affordable and reliable energy into the future.

Ingmar Ritzenhofen, Chief Commercial Officer, RWE Clean Energy: “RWE is proud to support Indiana’s all-of-the-above energy strategy with our portfolio of generation assets. Projects like Prairie Creek help bring needed power to the grid while also supporting new investment and job creation in the Hoosier State. Our investment in Prairie Creek will deliver lasting benefits to Blackford County through economic development payments and long-term tax revenue funding for schools, roads, first responders and other essential services, while providing a stable source of income for local multigenerational farming families.”

Steve Baker, president and chief operating officer, I&M: “By diversifying our generation mix, I&M is able to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and continue making a significant impact on the communities we serve. The addition of diverse, affordable energy resources is an important step in being Future Ready to serve customers’ homes, businesses and factories now and the years to come.”

Onsite construction is underway at Prairie Creek, with operations scheduled to begin in 2028. The project’s construction phase is expected to deliver substantial direct and indirect economic benefits to Blackford County, including the employment of approximately 240 workers onsite at peak construction. Notably, Prairie Creek supports local multigenerational farming families by offering a stable source of income for the project’s participating farmer-landowners. The additional income from property lease payments allows landowners to support their agricultural operations, maintain their properties and save for retirement, as well as use their increased purchasing power to fuel the local economy in Blackford County.

Prairie Creek will continue to deliver lasting benefits throughout its operating lifetime, including $60 million in property tax payments over 30 years to help fund Blackford County schools, libraries, roads, first responders and other essential services. The project will also contribute approximately $10 million in economic development payments to support local businesses in Blackford County.",https://www.rwe.com/-/media/RWE/images/07-presse/rwe-clean-energy/2025/OG-2025-12-18-rwe-and-indiana-michigan-power-company-partner-to-support-indianas-growing-electricity.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 04:01:49.503863

And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were key employers.
There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods.
This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.
Government efforts to prevent the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boost the demand for coal may slow coal’s decline in the short term.","As projections of U.S. electricity demand rise sharply, President Donald Trump is looking to coal – historically a dominant force in the U.S. energy economy – as a key part of the solution.

In an April 2025 executive order, for instance, Trump used emergency powers to direct the Department of Energy to order the owners of coal-fired power plants that were slated to be shut down to keep the plants running.

He also directed federal agencies to “identify coal resources on Federal lands” and ease the process for leasing and mining coal on those lands. In addition, he issued orders to exclude coal-related projects from environmental reviews, promote coal exports and potentially subsidize the production of coal as a national security resource.

But there remain limits to the president’s power to slow the declining use of coal in the U.S. And while efforts continue to overcome these limits and prop up coal, mining coal remains an ongoing danger to workers: In 2025, there have been five coal-mining deaths in West Virginia and at least two others elsewhere in the U.S.

A long legacy

Until 2015, coal-fired power plants generated more electricity than any other type of fuel in the U.S. But with the rapid expansion of a new type of hydraulic fracturing, natural gas became a cheap and stable source for power generation. The prices of solar and wind power also dropped steadily. These alternatives ultimately overcame coal in the U.S. power supply.

Before this change, coal mining defined the economy and culture of many U.S. towns – and some states and regions, such as Wyoming and Appalachia – for decades. And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were key employers.

Coal has both benefits and drawbacks. It provides a reliable fuel source for electricity that can be piled up on-site at power plants without needing a tank or underground facility for storage.

But it’s dirty: Thousands of coal miners developed a disease called black lung. The federal government pays for medical care for some sick miners and makes monthly payments to family members of miners who die prematurely. Burning coal also emits multiple air pollutants, prematurely killing half a million people in the United States from 1999 through 2020.

Coal is dangerous for workers, too. Some coal-mining companies have had abysmal safety records, leading to miner deaths, such as the recent drowning of a miner in a sudden flood in a West Virginia mine. Safety reforms have been implemented since the Big Branch Mine explosion in 2010, and coal miner deaths in the U.S. have since declined. But coal mining remains a hazardous job.

A champion of coal

In both of his terms, Trump has championed the revival of coal. In 2017, for example, Trump’s Department of Energy asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to pay coal and nuclear plants higher rates than the competitive market would pay, saying they were key to keeping the U.S. electricity grid running. The commission declined.

In his second term, Trump is more broadly using powers granted to the president in emergencies, and he is seeking to subsidize coal across the board – in mining, power plants and exports.

At least some of the urgency is coming from the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence, which the Trump administration champions. Many individual data centers use as much power as a small or medium city. There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods. Using those plants would require data centers to reduce their electricity use during those peaks – which it’s not clear they would agree to do.

So many data centers, desperate for 24/7 electricity, are relying on old coal-fired power plants – buying electricity from plants that otherwise would be shutting down.

Limits remain

Despite the Trump adminstration’s efforts to rapidly expand data centers and coal to power them, coal is more expensive than most other fuels for power generation, with costs still rising.

Half of U.S. coal mines have closed within the past two decades, and productivity at the remaining mines is declining due to a variety of factors, such as rising mining costs, environmental regulation and competition from cheaper sources. Coal exports have also seen declines in the midst of the tariff wars.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s recent effort to follow Trump’s orders and lease more coal on federal lands received only one bid – at a historically low price of less than a penny per ton. But in fact, even if the government gave its coal away for free, it would still make more economic sense for utilities to build power plants that use other fuels. This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.

Natural gas is cheaper – and, in some places, so are renewable energy and battery storage. Government efforts to prevent the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boost the demand for coal may slow coal’s decline in the short term. In the long term, however, coal faces a very uncertain future as a part of the U.S. electricity mix.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9894-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:50.449280

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country’s shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country’s copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India’s capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India’s battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India’s waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India’s government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery’s contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it’s an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule.
The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others.
Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.","As part of their proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to revise the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) (collectively, Agencies) hosted three public comment sessions in which they received verbal comments from those in attendance. Two of the sessions were held in person with virtual attendance options – Bismarck, North Dakota on December 12, 2025, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 15 – while the third session, on December 16, was fully virtual. EPA’s website contains additional details on the sessions, including draft agendas that list individuals who pre-registered to speak.

Background

As Nossaman previously detailed here, the Agencies are seeking to revise the definition of WOTUS and, thereby, what features would or would not be regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Because of the significant regulatory burden associated with being subject to CWA jurisdiction and permitting, the definition of WOTUS has been frequently litigated. The U.S. Supreme Court has weighed in on four separate occasions, and the Agencies have revised the definition four times in roughly a decade.

The Proposed Rule generally focuses on limiting federal jurisdiction through narrowing what qualifies as a WOTUS. More information on the rulemaking can be found here.

The Sessions

The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat. Representatives from the Agencies opened each session by explaining the need for the Proposed Rule. The Agencies stated there were three objectives served by the Proposed Rule: fully implementing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 598 U.S. 651 (2023); cutting red tape to reduce costs; and protecting water quality by striking the right balance between state and federal authority. They also highlighted that they were seeking clarity, certainty and durability while requesting information on regional differences and tools to implement any final rule.

Each session lasted between 3 and 3.5 hours. Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule. As a result, the Agencies did not answer any questions from those in attendance. The sessions were recorded for internal use, although the Agencies plan to post transcripts to their respective websites.

The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others. The first half of this session (i.e., pre-break) was hosted by U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) rather than by the Agencies. Senator Cramer, Senator John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong all voiced support for the Proposed Rule and opposition to the existing framework. The commenters during this part of the session included local government officials and business leaders, all of whom voiced their support for the Proposed Rule. It was also unique because no list of commenters was provided. The second half of this session set the stage for the following sessions, as it was led by the Agencies, included a list of pre-registered speakers (both online and in-person) that was provided to the observers and provided an opportunity for other commenters after that.

The Pittsburgh session included the least participation of the three. Like the North Dakota session, it included a mix of online and in-person commenters, providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The fully remote session was the most well attended, again providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The Comments

Across the three sessions, there were roughly 75-100 commenters. The comments were split nearly 50-50, with a slight edge over all of the sessions in commenters opposed to the Proposed Rule. However, the North Dakota and Pittsburgh sessions included more supportive comments whereas the remote-only session included more opposition comments. Many commenters requested the comment deadline be extended given the importance of the rule and the various holidays that fall within the comment period.

The following list summarizes the most common points made by commenters and is not intended to be exhaustive:

Comments in support

Common sense rule that can be instituted without the need for experts or lawyers and reduces uncertainty

Consistent with Sackett and other WOTUS precedent

Cuts red tape and lowers costs

Returns jurisdiction back to states, tribes and landowners, all of whom know their land better than bureaucrats

This rule is durable and should stop the back-and-forth of the past decade over WOTUS

Supporters often advocated for a strengthening of the Proposed Rule, listing the need for more clarity on significant terms such as continuous surface connection, relatively permanent and wet season. They also advocated for more clarity/a strengthening of essentially every exception that is listed, with ditches receiving the most attention. Supporters also advocated for tools and other guidance to assist with implementation.

Comments in opposition

Ignores the science on these issues, in particular the impact of wetlands, ditches and other now-excluded areas that impact traditional navigable waters

Features like intermittent streams and ephemeral streams have a substantial impact on navigable waters

Shifts costs away from those responsible onto the public

Especially the case with the loss of protection for wetlands, which provide flood control and other services that protect citizens

Contrary to the intent of the Clean Water Act, which has overwhelming support in public polling

Polls show that people want more protection, not less

Bad for public health

Does not protect tribal rights

A giveaway to polluters/developers/is political in nature

Next Steps

Written comments can be submitted until January 5, 2026, on www.regulations.gov; commenters must mention Docket ID EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

Given the number of commenters on both sides of the Proposed Rule requesting changes to it, it seems likely that the final rule could differ in some meaningful ways from the proposal. One area that the Agencies discussed was ensuring that the Proposed Rule properly reflected local conditions; they expressed a desire to ensure that the definitions and guidelines in the rule were clear enough to easily implement while also being crafted in a way to take into account regional differences in watershed conditions. For example, the commenters from North Dakota were supportive of the fact that prairie potholes did not qualify as WOTUS (although some wanted that more explicitly stated in any final rule) while one from Alaska discussed that this rule did not align with physical watershed conditions in Alaska. Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.",https://www.nossaman.com/i-t1766106585/logo-og.png,N,,2025-12-19 02:59:36.257332

World leaders were a bit premature in announcing the death of internal combustion. Ford recently became the latest global manufacturer to acknowledge it made a colossal, $20 billion mistake in throwing all its energy behind electric vehicles.

“The $50, $60, $70,000 EVs just weren’t selling. We’re following customers to where the market is. … These really expensive $70,000 electric trucks, as much as I love the product, they didn’t make sense,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC.

The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker wasn’t alone in going all in on converting its entire lineup into plug-ins. Just about every major brand embraced the delusion that, one day, people would intend to be able to travel a few hundred miles, pull over and wait an hour or more at a roadside station for their high-tech jalopy to draw sufficient juice from the grid.

Toyota was the notable exception in refusing to hop onto the politically correct bandwagon like its peers. The Japanese firm produces just one battery-motivated vehicle. The remaining offerings include an assortment of hybrids, normal sedans and SUVs. It even offers a pair of gas-guzzling sports cars, a rare option in these times.

C-suite automotive executives elsewhere felt their world turn upside down when President Trump flipped the off switch on the subsidies. Predictably, EV sales plunged 53% the instant the freebies vanished. The administration is also eliminating the onerous fleet mileage targets that were meant to strangle vehicles animated by fossil fuels.

On the bright side, the big car companies will no longer toss billions of dollars into the bonfire by developing overpriced models that nobody wants. Misallocated capital resources pushed sticker prices skyward, even on gas-powered cars, because someone has to pay for that research and development.

Thus, an average automobile now costs $50,000, a staggering $16,000 rise over the past 10 years. With the scam unraveling, these numbers should settle.

“It was ridiculous, very expensive. It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate. Biden’s burdensome regulations have caused the price of cars to soar more than 25%, and in one case, they went up 18% in one year,” Mr. Trump said earlier this month as he signed the executive order killing the previous administration’s CAFE standards.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy added on X, “Freedom Means Affordable Cars,” and even the Europeans are seeing the wisdom of Mr. Trump’s actions. The European Commission released a package of reforms Tuesday that some have styled as a reversal of the EV mandate.

It’s more of a slight scaling back. Instead of dictating that 100% of cars must be electric, the bureaucrats in Brussels will allow 10% to be gas-powered. How generous of them. “The Automotive Omnibus will ease administrative burden and cut costs for European manufacturers, boosting their global competitiveness, and freeing up resources for decarbonisation,” a commission statement explained.

That’s good news for Detroit, because a 10% reprieve isn’t enough to stay competitive. Let the Continent continue to dwell in the schemes of the past while America readjusts to restore the liberty the public once had to buy the product that best suits its needs and tastes.

Government meddling in car design has flopped, and Ford’s misadventures serve as a cautionary tale for lawmakers intent on intruding elsewhere in the economy.

Capacity prices in PJM hit fresh record high

PJM’s supply shortfall affects 13-state region, raising power bills

Governors push for extended price limits

Dec 17 (Reuters) – Power bills for about a fifth of Americans are expected to continue to rise after the largest U.S. grid operator, PJM Interconnection, reported fresh record-high capacity prices on Wednesday that reflected electricity demand by data centers overtaking supplies.

The expansion of Big Tech’s data centers has driven up so-called capacity prices in PJM by about 1,000% over a roughly two-year period, intensifying energy affordability problems for those living and working in the 13-state region covered by the grid operator.

Prices reached $333.44 a megawatt-day in the latest PJM capacity auction.

“This auction leaves no doubt that data centers’ demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply, and the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself,” said Stu Bresler, who becomes PJM’s chief operating officer next month.

Rising costs in PJM have hit everyday power bills in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest U.S. states in the grid’s territory, with some areas seeing a more than 20% jump in utility bills starting from last summer.

Capacity prices make up a portion of utility bills, while other spending on power lines and services and the cost of fuel, such as natural gas, also contribute to the overall cost.

PJM, which operates the grid covering the largest amount of energy-intensive data centers in the world, holds auctions to determine the prices that energy companies will be paid to guarantee they run their power plants when called upon.

On-call generators in PJM’s capacity market are meant to guard against disruptions like blackouts during times when power demand spikes, and the high prices are aimed at encouraging developers to build more supply.

More supply, however, is not coming on fast enough. The available supply secured in the latest auction reached 134,479 megawatts. That was about 6,600 megawatts, or enough to power nearly 5 million homes, short of PJM’s reliability requirement, PJM officials said.

Higher consumer costs led a group of PJM-area governors, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, to negotiate a price ceiling and floor. That price ceiling took effect during the last auction, in July, and extended through the latest bidding round.

Shapiro and others are now calling for the price limit to be extended to future auctions.

“Reforms must be in place in time to protect Pennsylvania ratepayers before the next (auction),” Shapiro said in a filing this week with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

MORE AUCTIONS

PJM once held its auctions three years out from the time the prices took effect to give power companies time to plan for new developments and to budget ahead of time. With regulatory delays affecting the power grid operator in recent years, capacity auctions have begun to take place less than a year out, which power companies say have slowed the pace of new developments.

PJM is now holding catch-up auctions as a way to get back to its three-year-out program. The prices released on Wednesday will take effect for the year beginning in June 2027.

In the meantime, existing power plant owners in PJM are expected to see windfalls from the recent capacity prices. Independent power producer Talen Energy said on Wednesday it expected to land more than $1 billion in capacity revenues for the 2027-2028 planning year.

Shares of Talen were up 3.7% after the market closed, while other PJM-region power producers Constellation Energy and Vistra were also higher by 2.7% and 1.6%, respectively.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India's growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country's copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India's capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India's battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India's waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world's most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India's government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery's contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it's an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

This follows Senate Republicans’ failure last week to join Democrats in extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits, which 267,000 veterans rely on to afford health care. Coupled with Medicare and Medicaid cuts – which go into effect next year – Americans, including millions of veterans and veteran family members, are bracing for higher costs and a looming health care crisis.

“The 2025 budget reconciliation bill, Public Law 119-21, or the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ (BBB), will reduce access to essential health care and supportive services for millions of Americans, including veterans and their families. Compounded with expiring enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans established by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, veterans are facing a life-threatening reduction in access to health care and other essential benefits. These reductions in access to private health insurance, Medicaid, and funding for community health services will result in more veterans relying more heavily on their Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits,” the Senators wrote.

1.6 million veterans and four million family members of veterans utilize Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage because of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” One in ten veterans under the age of 65 relies on Medicaid, and forty percent of these veterans rely on Medicaid as their sole coverage. In addition, recent analysis found 267,000 veterans who rely on ACA enhanced premium tax credits will no longer be able to afford ACA marketplace coverage if these credits are not extended. Veterans who benefit from ACA tax credits are largely not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, or who are not eligible to get some or all of their health care through VA.

The Senators emphasized their concerns with these widespread health care cuts amid the Trump Administration’s ongoing efforts to shrink VA: “Because of the recent catastrophic, unnecessary cuts to VA’s workforce and resources since January 20, 2025, we are deeply concerned about the Department’s capability to support this potential spike in utilization. We write to request you review how these widespread cuts to health care access for all Americans will also impact veterans and their families and to what extent VA will be able to support an influx of veterans relying on the Department for health care more than ever before.”

Recent reporting exposed the Trump Administration’s plan to eliminate as many as 35,000 health care jobs at VA this month, including unfilled positions for doctors, nurses, and support staff. In addition, VA already lost more than 30,000 employees between January and September of this year as a result of President Trump and VA Secretary Collins’ hiring freeze, deferred resignations, early retirements, and the significant number of VA staff who have quit due to Trump and Collins’ draconian workforce policies.

The full text of the lawmakers’ letter is available here and below.

Dear Mr. Dodaro:

The 2025 budget reconciliation bill, Public Law 119-21, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (BBB), will reduce access to essential health care and supportive services for millions of Americans, including veterans and their families. Compounded with expiring enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans established by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, veterans are facing a life-threatening reduction in access to health care and other essential benefits. These reductions in access to private health insurance, Medicaid, and funding for community health services will result in more veterans relying more heavily on their Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits. Because of the recent catastrophic, unnecessary cuts to VA’s workforce and resources since January 20, 2025, we are deeply concerned about the Department’s capability to support this potential spike in utilization. We write to request you review how these widespread cuts to health care access for all Americans will also impact veterans, and their families and to what extent VA will be able to support an influx of veterans relying on the Department for health care more than ever before.

Up to 5.6 million veterans and their family members rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing coverage as a result of funding cuts and further restrictions on eligibility enacted in the BBB. Nearly one in ten veterans under 65 rely on Medicaid, with forty percent of those veterans relying on Medicaid as their sole coverage – often due to ineligibility for Medicare or VA health care. Medicaid helps ensure regular access to care for veterans and their families, especially those who have diverse heath care needs or require care with high out-of-pocket costs, both of which can pose a barrier to care. Regardless of VA’s capacity to absorb these veterans that may now need to rely on the Department for more of their care, many of them are ineligible or were using Medicaid as a supplement because the Department couldn’t provide access to the care they required.

The 140,000 women veterans currently utilizing Medicaid will be particularly impacted by the cuts to this program. This includes nearly one in nine women veterans nationwide and more than one in five women veterans with disabilities, nearly one in seven rural women veterans, and 12.4 percent (54,000) of women veterans who are mothers. Nearly four in ten women veterans rely solely on Medicaid for their health care coverage. For those who are ineligible for Medicare or VA health care, the cuts made in the BBB will likely leave them uninsured resulting in high vulnerability to medical debt or being barred from accessing care altogether.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was also severely harmed by the BBB. Currently, 1.2 million veteran households rely on SNAP benefits. The sixty-three percent of veterans on SNAP who are under 65 will be newly subject to so-called work requirements to maintain access to SNAP. Exemptions from these punishing requirements for disabling conditions are not clearly defined in the BBB, leaving uncertainty regarding whether veterans with disabilities limiting their ability to sustain regular employment will have the requirement waived. For example, a veteran with a traumatic brain injury or severe post-traumatic stress disorder – both conditions more common in veterans than non-veterans and which often require more complex accommodations – may not be exempt despite being unable to maintain the focus or manage the stressors required by many employers. Because of these changes, many veteran households will experience reduced access to SNAP and, therefore, because there is no equivalent alternative service available through VA or any other federal program, their main source of food.

Like the harmful and ineffectual work reporting requirements added to SNAP, the BBB also added these so-called work requirements for certain adults, including veterans, to access Medicaid. The BBB mandates Medicaid enrollees aged 19-64 who are covered through the ACA’s Medicaid expansion must engage in employment, education, a work program, or community service to maintain their Medicaid eligibility. This requirement cannot be waived. Though there are exemptions allowed for certain individuals, including disabled veterans – defined as veterans with a disability rated as total under section 1155 of Title 38, United States Code – and caregivers of children thirteen years of age and under or disabled individuals, the gray areas of life and disabilities often do not align with these black and white requirements. Applying for or updating veteran disability ratings or caregiver status is already a significant challenge and can take years to establish, which, under these new bureaucratic requirements, could leave veterans or their loved ones without health care.

Even veterans who will not lose their coverage due to these Medicaid cuts may no longer be able to access health care because of their reliance on ACA premium tax credits. Since the ACA coverage provisions took effect, the number of uninsured, non-elderly veterans has decreased by more than one-third, from 9.6 percent to 5.9 percent. As Congress expanded the premium tax credits starting in 2021, the ACA marketplace enrollment more than doubled by 2025. However, these enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of this year, and without them many veterans will be forced to withdraw from their health care coverage because they can no longer afford it. This may increase their reliance on VA for their care if they’re eligible, but many veterans who are ineligible for VA care and benefits will lose access to health care entirely. Furthermore, VA’s actuarial firm has indicated that for every one percent of increased reliance on the Department for care, VA can expect its costs to increase by $2.6 billion – a cost unaccounted for in the BBB or VA’s budget request for fiscal year 2026, when these changes will start to take effect.

It is critical for Congress, VA, and, most importantly, veteran households to understand how these recent changes will impact their access to essential health care and nutrition services. With a better understanding of these impacts, Congress and the veteran community can better advocate for swift and effective changes to mitigate the truly catastrophic future created by the BBB. To that end, we request you conduct a review of the potential and actual impacts of this bill and the expiration of the enhanced ACA tax credits on veterans and their families.

To expedite access to this data and improve Congress’ ability to act proactively, we request an initial review and estimation of potential harmful impacts based on current utilization, followed by a subsequent review of the actual impacts to veterans as they unfold from 2026-2028. To the extent practicable, please disaggregate your findings by age, gender, household size, employment status, average income, and any other categories you deem appropriate. In particular, we request you address the following questions as they pertain to veterans and their families, to the extent data are available:

How many utilize SNAP or Medicaid and are impacted by the BBB?

How many will lose access to affordable health care or health care altogether due to expiration of ACA enhanced premium tax credits?

How many are subject to work reporting requirements set for Medicaid? How many are eligible for exceptions to those requirements?

How many are subject to work reporting requirements set for SNAP? How many are eligible for exceptions to those requirements?

How many veterans impacted by changes to SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA enhanced premium tax credits are currently, have recently, or are at risk of experiencing homelessness?

We look forward to working with you to conduct oversight on this important issue. If you have any questions about this request, please have your staff contact the office of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Minority Staff.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India(AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country's shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country's copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India's capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India's battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India's waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India's government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery's contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it's an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

That’s why I support permitting reform and why reforming NEPA is necessary if America is going to remain competitive.
“I was encouraged when Chairman Westerman introduced the SPEED Act.
Our goal is simple: a permitting process that is efficient, predictable, and fair for investors, communities, and the environment alike.” “We urgently need to get permitting reform done this Congress.
These concerns were not addressed before SPEED was brough to the House Floor.","Washington, D.C. – Today, Representative Scott Peters (CA-50) released the following statement after voting against the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development or SPEED Act to update the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

“The environmental laws of the 1970s were designed to stop projects. The environmental imperative of today is to build. That’s why I support permitting reform and why reforming NEPA is necessary if America is going to remain competitive.

“I was encouraged when Chairman Westerman introduced the SPEED Act. The bill reduces the statute of limitations and ensures that environmental reviews can satisfy federal requirements, saving both time and money. The bill also ensures federal dollars cannot solely trigger federal environmental reviews, streamlining the federal grant process, so that we can get grant money out of the bank and into the ground. These are exactly the types of reforms America needs to build energy infrastructure responsibly and efficiently.

“Earlier this month, I led a letter with 30 Democratic colleagues outlining our support for permitting reform and the specific changes needed to earn additional Democratic support for this bill. In the letter, we emphasized four key areas that must be addressed for broad bipartisan support.

“We emphasized that projects that comply with the law must be protected from political interference, that courts should have a targeted role to ensure decisions are based on accurate analysis, and that local stakeholders should continue to have meaningful input early in the process. We also highlighted the need to avoid provisions that could backfire, delay projects, or reduce the quality of environmental reviews. Our goal is simple: a permitting process that is efficient, predictable, and fair for investors, communities, and the environment alike.”

“We urgently need to get permitting reform done this Congress. I remain committed to continuing to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with the Senate to craft truly bipartisan solutions that can become law and help America build the clean, reliable energy infrastructure we need.”

Background: Rep. Peters has been a longtime champion of permitting reform in Congress and was encouraged to see the SPEED Act brought up before the House Natural Resources Committee in November. After passing out of Committee, Rep. Peters sent a letter signed by 30 of his House Democratic colleagues, to the Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Bruce Westerman, outlining what they’d like to see in the final bill. These concerns were not addressed before SPEED was brough to the House Floor.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid.
Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory.
“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom.","Calls are mounting for the largest US grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record of $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in the year starting June 2027, according to PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans. That fee will come on top of what consumers pay for the power they actually use, plus other line items on their bills such as charges for maintaining and expanding the power lines.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive build-out of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators. Vistra Corp., which rose as much as 2.7% in early trading Thursday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.6%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion, with shares up 2.7%.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesman Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities – Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. – will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

Utility company DTE Electric argued it needed quick approval to move forward with the energy-intensive project backed by tech companies OpenAI and Oracle.

Thursday’s decision takes advantage of a policy allowing projects to skip a deeper review, known as a contested case, if they won’t raise rates for other customers.

Michigan Public Service Commission chair Dan Scripps said contracts put the project on the hook for billions of dollars, regardless of if it pans out.

“This provides real protections that don’t exist in many other states to ensure that, if ultimately, this is a bubble, if this is all overblown and that the load doesn’t materialize, that again, even in that worst case scenario, customers are still protected,” Scripps said.

DTE would need to expand its energy capacity by a quarter for the data center. The project would require over a gigawatt of energy, more than an average nuclear reactor produces, according to U.S. Department of Energy estimates.

Opponents say they don’t trust that ratepayers won’t be left holding the bill. York Township resident Sarah Brabbs said no one has fully explained how the project will be held accountable.

“Who determined if that’s there. Is that there? We don’t know. But if it is, we don’t know who determined what it looks like. We don’t know who’s in charge of it. If it’s part of the dealmakers or is it someone else? What does that look like? How are you testing and making sure that they do what they say?” Brabbs said.

During the Public Service Commission meeting, attendees frequently heckled commission members. The vote faced massive backlash as attendees took issue over both environmental concerns and because the plan skipped the reviews that would’ve been part of a contested case.

Local resident Beth Foley said it was worth a deeper look.

“There is potential for egregious harm by fast tracking this with no downside in taking your time and ensuring you got it right,” she said.

The MPSC insists it did conduct a thorough review.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick said her board and their staff got to see several documents not available to the public, including unredacted versions of the contracts up for approval.

She said she was satisfied enough was there to keep Michiganders safe. Peretick argued because the companies and DTE would responsible for the infrastructure upgrades, the deal would benefit everyday ratepayers.

“The power supply agreement and energy storage agreement are well-negotiated contracts.

Other large-scale solar projects had costs that doubled that figure.
Regional collaboration The selection of new solar projects was conducted through a multi-state process led by DEEP.
Connecticut also selected two solar projects in Vermont; Viridis Solar, with 50 megawatts, and Fair Haven Solar, with 20 megawatts.","​​The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced the selection of three solar projects on Thursday that will expand grid capacity, racing to lock in federal clean energy tax credits before they expire.

The agency said the projects would secure affordable, reliable and clean energy sources — but declined to disclose the bid prices.

“The price is kept confidential while negotiations are ongoing,” a department spokesperson responded to queries from CT Examiner.

The selected projects will total approximately 67 megawatts of capacity, enough to supply 12,000 homes in the state, according to DEEP. The agency expects them to be online before the end of 2030.

In its press release, DEEP explained the selection was launched on September 10 and conducted expeditiously to choose advanced-stage projects that could capitalize on federal incentives while they’re still available.

“We are pleased to announce the selection of new grid-scale solar projects that can take advantage of federal tax credits before they expire to help provide affordable, reliable clean energy to Connecticut residents and businesses,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “By working together with New England and state partners, and working quickly to take advantage of competitively priced projects, we are able to secure greater affordability and reliability benefits for Connecticut at a fraction of the cost.”

The Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the Biden Administration, modified tax credits for carbon-neutral technologies, with changes that took effect in January this year. These changes introduced two types of benefits, of which developers could choose only one—an immediate 30% tax credit on the investment value or a tax credit of up to 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour produced over 10 years from the start of production.

The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed this year, determined that credits for solar and wind projects would be eliminated for projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 and projects that are not in service before the end of 2027. However, projects that begin or are completed before those two deadlines would not be affected.

The cost of renewable energy has been a political football in recent years. Critics blame renewable generation in part for the state’s high cost of electricity, among the most expensive in the country, while renewable energy advocates point to falling costs in recent years, and the need to decarbonize the state’s sources of energy.

Over the past 12 months, the wholesale price of electricity in Connecticut was just above 7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Other large-scale solar projects had costs that doubled that figure.

Revolution Wind, the first offshore wind project expected to start supplying power to Connecticut homes next year, has an agreed 10 cents per kilowatt-hour price in its purchase agreement.

State Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, introduced a proposal in the past legislative session that would have prohibited power purchase agreements at 150% above the wholesale price.

Regional collaboration

The selection of new solar projects was conducted through a multi-state process led by DEEP. Massachusetts and Maine participated, along with Vermont’s largest electric utility. Connecticut chose the largest capacity, accounting for 39% of the 173 megawatts selected collectively by the four states.

“Regional collaboration is critical to expanding and diversifying our energy supply, especially as we work to bring down the cost of electricity for Connecticut ratepayers,” Gov. Ned Lamont said, according to a press release issued by DEEP. “These resources can start providing power in the near future, sooner than any other new generation resources, and will help ensure we have a more reliable and affordable grid.”

Connecticut’s share of the project will be funded through contracts with utilities, subject to review by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.

Husky Solar, a 50-megawatt project, is the project that would be located in Connecticut, in the town of Plainfield. The state selected 25% of this project’s capacity, while the remainder was divided between Massachusetts and Maine.

Connecticut also selected two solar projects in Vermont; Viridis Solar, with 50 megawatts, and Fair Haven Solar, with 20 megawatts. Connecticut secured about 80% of each project’s capacity.

The state has significantly expanded its solar capacity over the past decade to nearly 1.7 gigawatts by 2024, enough to power about 245,000 homes, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Last year, when Connecticut decided to pass on selecting offshore wind energy in the tri-state auction held with Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the state announced the same day that it had opted for solar and batteries to increase capacity.",https://ctexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AdobeStock_290547138-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 23:59:07.465383

The Bill of Rights explains that consumers who believe a business has violated Indiana’s CDPA may submit a complaint to the Office of the Indiana Attorney General, including through the online portal available on the Attorney General’s website.","In advance of the Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act’s (“Act”) effective date on January 1, 2026, the Indiana Attorney General released a Data Consumer Bill of Rights (“Bill of Rights”) that summarizes the rights created in the Act.

The Bill of Rights explains that consumers have certain rights under the Act, including:

Right to Know: The Bill of Rights explains that consumers have a right to know if a controller is processing their data and to obtain a copy of the personal data the consumer has previously provided to a controller. The Bill of Rights also explains to consumers that controllers are required to publish a privacy notice with the categories of personal information collected, processed, and disclosed.

Right to Control: The Bill of Rights categorizes several consumer rights under the group of “right to control.” Specifically, it details that consumers have the right to correct inaccuracies in personal data they previously provided to the controller and request the deletion of their personal data. Additionally, the Bill of Rights describes the right to portability as the right to “easily move [consumers’] personal data to different platforms.”

Right to Protect: Under the description “right to protect,” the Bill of Rights details consumers’ rights to opt-out of processing their personal data for targeted advertising, sale, or profiling for certain purposes. Additionally, the Bill of Rights states that consumers have the right to consent to the processing of their sensitive personal data.

Right to Take Action: Consumers have the right to invoke and exercise their data privacy rights without discrimination and can appeal a controller’s decision to refuse a rights request.

Additionally, the Bill of Rights states that consumers have the right to have the collection of personal data limited to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary to the purpose communicated by the controller and to consent to processing for purposes not reasonably necessary for nor compatible with the purpose communicated by the controller.

The Bill of Rights explains that consumers who believe a business has violated Indiana’s CDPA may submit a complaint to the Office of the Indiana Attorney General, including through the online portal available on the Attorney General’s website. The Act provides controllers or processors with a required 30-day cure period to resolve alleged violations. Indiana joins other states in publishing informal guidance ahead of 2026 privacy laws or updates taking effect. For example, the California Privacy Protection Agency recently released guidance on “7 Things to Know Before 2026 CCPA Updates Take Effect.”",https://www.globalpolicywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2024/09/Global-Policy-Watch_Social-Media-Preview-Asset-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 23:59:14.652023

The Dec. 10 decision restores the Rooted in Comunidad, Cultivating Equity (RICCE) initiative — a Transformative Climate Communities (TCC) grant — to its originally proposed $29.5 million funding level, ensuring that all community-identified improvement projects can proceed as planned. The additional funding was made possible by the passage of Proposition 4 in 2024, which supports expanded investment in climate-related projects. The initiative is led by San Diego Foundation and the Environmental Health Coalition, working alongside 10 dedicated community partner organizations.

Developed through extensive community engagement in Barrio Logan, Logan Heights, Sherman Heights, Shelltown, Stockton, Grant Hill, Mount Hope and Southcrest, the project reflects priorities identified directly by residents, including:

Improved air quality near industrial corridors

Safer, more accessible streets and transit connections

Urban greening and expanded open space

Workforce development tied to climate-related careers

Increased affordable housing and anti-gentrification efforts

“This funding restoration demonstrates California’s commitment to supporting community-driven climate solutions, even during times of uncertainty,” said Mark Stuart, President and CEO of San Diego Foundation. “San Diego Foundation remains dedicated to being a steady, reliable partner for the residents of the historic barrios, ensuring that investments align with community priorities and that a healthier, more sustainable future can move forward as planned.”

The supplemental award restores California’s original level of support for the project following funding volatility that affected climate initiatives statewide:

The Rooted in Comunidad, Cultivating Equity initiative was initially awarded $22 million in 2023, with project partners encouraged to seek additional resources to close the remaining gap.

While federal funding for the initiative awarded through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 was later rescinded in 2025 as part of a national policy shift, the state of California’s action ensures stability for the community-driven work and allows implementation to proceed as planned.

“This funding is an initial step in restoring hope and trust in a community that wasn’t just devastated by the EPA funding cuts this year, but that has been underinvested in for generations,” said Jose Franco Garcia, Executive Director of Environmental Health Coalition. “This is a huge win for San Diego’s historic barrios, especially the over 400 community members who participated in the grant application process, helping identify which improvement projects will preserve, protect, and strengthen their community.”

California’s TCC program invests in neighborhood-level climate solutions in communities facing longstanding environmental and economic challenges. Projects are required to be developed with meaningful community input and to deliver measurable benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health and economic opportunity. The RICCE initiative represents one of four projects across the state selected for TCC funding in 2023.

With full state funding now secured, project partners are moving forward with implementation while continuing to explore additional resources to address the loss of federal support.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.

Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said demand is outpacing the ability of the market alone to reliably and affordably serve data centers and existing customers.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the revisions will help to manage electricity costs as the race to develop artificial intelligence drives an unprecedented increase in electricity use across the country.

In Thursday’s meeting, the commission unanimously approved an order directing PJM Interconnection to revise its tariff — a compilation of rate schedules and terms of a particular company or utility — to detail the terms and conditions for customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load. The order directs PJM to offer customers who want to co-locate four options to manage how data centers and other large loads interact with the grid.

Montgomery County-headquartered PJM manages the wholesale electricity market and grid for about 65 million customers in Pennsylvania and 12 other states plus Washington, D.C.

US Energy Secretary says Three Mile Island restart delivers on Trump administration promises

“PJM has been actively engaged with stakeholders throughout 2025 to address the rapid growth of data centers and the related increase in demand for electricity,” spokesman Jeff Shields said in a statement.

Shields added the PJM board intends to move forward with a proposal to FERC derived from its own process in which stakeholders have provided their input on possible solutions.

“We share FERC’s focus on clear and transparent rules as data centers expand their role as an engine of the U.S. economy. PJM is reviewing the order and will assess how it impacts efforts already underway.”

FERC Chairperson Laura Swett said Thursday the decision would advance the nation in the AI and manufacturing revolution while safeguarding the prices consumers pay for electricity.

“While uncertainty has abounded across our country on how we will facilitate data centers, this morning, my colleagues and I are taking a critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem,” Swett said.

In February, FERC initiated a proceeding to review issues associated with the co-location of AI data centers, which can use as much electricity as a small city, and generators to ensure the clarity of the rates, terms and conditions of service that apply to co-location arrangements.

“Co-location arrangements are a fairly new phenomenon that entail huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs,” former Chairperson Mark Christie said in February. “Given these ramifications, the commission truly needs to ‘get it right’ when it comes to evaluating co-location issues.”

Advanced Energy United, an association for the renewable energy industry, said the order has potential to bring welcome regulatory clarity for large load customers and safeguards to minimize the impact of co-location on the electric rates and system reliability of all other customers.

Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said demand is outpacing the ability of the market alone to reliably and affordably serve data centers and existing customers.

“Advanced energy solutions like battery storage, solar, wind, demand response, and distributed energy resources are well-suited to reliability and affordably serve new large loads in PJM and across the country,” Marquis said. “The advanced energy industry will welcome new rules within PJM that empower large load customers to bring their own new clean energy to the system, benefiting all energy users.”

Co-location, the group noted, is attractive to AI hyperscalers because it can result in faster connections for data centers, which companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are competing to bring online first.

Microsoft has a $1.6 billion deal with Constellation Energy to restart the remaining nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Dauphin County to power its data centers elsewhere in the PJM service area. Amazon announced an agreement to buy a data center development adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna Steam Electric nuclear power station in Luzerne County.

Co-location also raises questions about who will pay for additional transmission infrastructure and how large loads or other customers will be affected by fluctuations in electricity supply across the grid.

Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents competitive power generators, said the order provides options, recognizing that there are a variety of approaches to co-locating large electricity users and generating stations.

“Clearly, this is the first step in a process that will require quick action and durable consensus from many stakeholders and highlights the urgency in getting solutions onto the system and for that we applaud FERC’s approach,” Snitchler said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img_6060-1024x7681766105653.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=1mFLeP7y,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:46.174997

There are various ways to index the downturn of the U.S. nuclear industry, but the starkest is probably by permits.
From 1954 to 1978, regulators issued a hundred and thirty-three construction permits for civilian nuclear reactors.
Although this now looks like a mixed bargain, at the time, the U.S. nuclear industry was only too happy to take it.
Kairos represents a new era for the U.S. nuclear industry.","This April, in a speech given at the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the physicist Xu Hongjie announced a breakthrough. For over a decade, his team had been working on an experimental nuclear reactor that runs on a lava-hot solution of fissile material and molten salt, rather than on solid fuel. The reactor, which went online two years ago, was a feat in itself. It is still the only one of its kind in operation in the world, and has the potential to be both safer and more efficient than the water-cooled nuclear plants that dominate the industry. Now, Xu explained, his team had been able to refuel the reactor without shutting it down, demonstrating a level of mastery over their new system.

As dazzling as that was, the timing of Xu’s speech also freighted the topic with geopolitical import. Only a few months earlier, DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial-intelligence company, had set alarms ringing through the U.S. tech world when it became clear that the relatively small Chinese startup, operating under U.S. export controls, had created a large language model that rivalled anything devised by the behemoths of Silicon Valley. Xu cast his team’s molten-salt reactor in the same light: yet another sign that the technology gap between China and the U.S. had closed.

Xu explained that his team had based their design on an experimental reactor that had been built in Tennessee in the nineteen-sixties. Known as the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment, or the M.S.R.E., that project hit a dead end in the early seventies, when it lost federal funding. Xu’s team had learned everything they could about the M.S.R.E. so that, decades later, they could bring the project back to life. Xu compared their labors to the story of the tortoise and the hare: whereas the United States had “gotten lazy and made a mistake,” China had seized the “chance to overtake” it.

In reality, China’s molten-salt reactor was less the product of a race than a collaboration. Less than ten years earlier, Xu’s team had been working with an array of American nuclear scientists. M.I.T. had irradiated graphite samples for the Chinese scientists. Nuclear engineers from Berkeley flew to Shanghai to review the original design. And by 2015, at what was perhaps the peak of U.S.-China amity in the sciences, Xu’s home institution, the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, or SINAP, had signed a coöperative research-and-development agreement with Tennessee’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the site of the world’s first molten-salt reactor.

These agreements could be seen as products of Reagan-era neoliberalism. They allow national labs to hire out their facilities and staff to outside entities that, in exchange for funding, can secure a proprietary claim to any technologies U.S. national labs discover while working on the designated project. For the most part, this has facilitated technology transfer from public institutions to the private sector. But the agreement between O.R.N.L. and SINAP created an unprecedented situation: a Chinese state-owned lab was paying an American lab millions of dollars to develop materials and plumbing for molten-salt reactors.

From the start, the American side operated under the belief that the Chinese would be the first to build a molten-salt reactor. China was spending the money to do it, after all. There was some funding for molten-salt research in America, but much less than was needed, and this was why the Oak Ridge researchers were willing to accept support from the Chinese. Through the partnership, the American researchers were hoping to advance work on a less complex reactor, in which molten salt would be used as a coolant rather than a fuel line. “The budget is what the budget is,” David Holcomb, Oak Ridge’s principal investigator for the agreement, explained during a conference appearance at the time.

Ten years later, the armature of assumptions and policies that enabled such a partnership has been blown apart. After Donald Trump won the 2016 Presidential election, the Department of Energy severed ties with SINAP and threatened to revoke licenses from American companies that exported nuclear technology to China. During Trump’s second term, the Administration’s hostility toward China has only increased. “If you write about the coöperative research agreement, the new Administration will fire everyone for being evil collaborators,” a senior figure at a U.S. nuclear company told me. He was only half joking. When I requested information about molten-salt research at Oak Ridge, the media-relations manager there told me “we won’t be able to help you this time,” and later minimized the extent of the facility’s coöperation with SINAP. After a brief back-and-forth with Idaho National Laboratory and Los Alamos about interview requests for David Holcomb, who has since moved to the private sector, and for Thomas Mason, who had been the head of Oak Ridge during its partnership with SINAP, both laboratories stopped responding to my messages. This reticence stands in contrast to the atmosphere a few years ago, when Holcomb gave multiple interviews to the press, and Oak Ridge allowed tours of the facility that had originally housed its molten-salt reactor.

My two e-mails to Xu Hongjie similarly went unanswered. Then, in November, Xu passed away, reportedly dying while at work at his desk.

The days of “common interest” and “open science,” invoked by Holcomb in 2015, have given way to new mantras of “geostrategic influence” and “national security.” These talking points, which have been embraced by Republicans and Democrats alike, call on nationalism to reboot an industry withered by decades of retrenchment. It remains to be seen if this is enough to make the U.S. nuclear industry competitive in international markets, or even profitable domestically.

To make sense of what is happening in nuclear energy today, it helps to know about what was once called “the first nuclear era”—a thirty-seven-year stretch between 1942, when Enrico Fermi oversaw the first controlled fission chain reaction, and 1979, when the second reactor at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, in southeastern Pennsylvania, partially melted down. At the height of this period, around 1960, the United States accounted for almost seventy per cent of global spending on R. & D. Nuclear energy, which sat at the nexus of defense and civil engineering, was a double beneficiary. From these investments came a series of ever more terrifying weapons alongside a fleet of experimental and commercial reactors that made the U.S. the world’s largest producer of nuclear energy. America still holds this title, but China is poised to assume the mantle, probably sometime around 2030.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment epitomized the possibilities of this period. The concept originated in the late nineteen-forties, with a request from the Air Force to develop a nuclear-powered airplane. Alvin Weinberg, who later became the director of research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, didn’t think that such an aircraft would fly, but he was willing to try to build one. He had helped develop the reactors that produced plutonium for the Manhattan Project and moved to East Tennessee, after the war. There, he presided over the development of O.R.N.L., which grew from a plutonium-production facility near the Clinch River. For Weinberg, the purpose of a national lab was to try “things too difficult or too risky for private industry to undertake.” An airplane that burned uranium was precisely that.

Weinberg wrote that the reactor would need to reach temperatures around fifteen hundred degrees Fahrenheit in order to power a jet engine. His team surmised that such heat would mangle any fuel rods small enough to install into an aircraft, so they decided to use fluoride salts. These melted into a liquid at around four hundred degrees Celsius and stayed stable above sixteen hundred degrees. With uranium fluoride mixed in, the molten salt itself could function as fuel.

The system went critical in November, 1954. In its brief life, it showed some remarkable properties, but the test also revealed some of the challenges of working with molten salt. Leaks were a constant problem, and the radiotoxicity of most of the apparatus made repairs next to impossible. As a stopgap, Weinberg’s team had to repeatedly off-gas the reactor compartment, bathing a nearby forest in radioactive xenon and iodine. At the hundred-hour mark, the project was shut down.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment gave him another shot. By then, the Atomic Energy Commission was ready to make major investments in order to develop breeder reactors, or reactors that produce more fissile material than they burn. Breeder reactors promised energy on a scale far beyond what could be provided by the global supply of coal and oil, fuels that were projected to become scarce within a century and which were already suspected of warming the Earth. Planning began in 1960, and five years later Weinberg’s team loaded sixty-nine kilograms of enriched uranium into the salt. This time, the experiment was a success. The M.S.R.E. logged over thirteen thousand operational hours, during which the researchers ran countless tests. “​​They did, like, every calculation you could have done at the time to understand how you would build and run and fuel this reactor,” Katy Huff, the Assistant Secretary of Nuclear Energy under President Joe Biden, said. The most important finding was a simple one: the M.S.R.E. proved that a molten-salt reactor was viable.

Weinberg had hoped to move from the M.S.R.E. to a molten-salt breeder reactor. But in 1973 President Richard Nixon pulled federal funding for molten-salt research in order to go all-in on a competing breeder reactor that was cooled with sodium. In 1983, the sodium breeder, in turn, lost its funding. Plagued by budget overages, the project also fell victim to a conservative revolt, spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. By then, the public had also soured on nuclear-energy projects, owing to the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, in 1979.

There are various ways to index the downturn of the U.S. nuclear industry, but the starkest is probably by permits. From 1954 to 1978, regulators issued a hundred and thirty-three construction permits for civilian nuclear reactors. Between 1979 and 2012, they issued none. “There’s been almost no real work on nuclear power since the seventies,” Nathan Myhrvold, who sits on the board of TerraPower, a nuclear-technology company that he co-founded with Bill Gates, told me. “The Department of Energy still had some research programs going, and I don’t want to slight anyone who was in one of those things. But they stopped building plants. When you stop building plants, it makes it very hard for companies to justify the enormous number of engineers it takes.”

“The thing that struck me the first time we went to China, in particular, is they assigned an awful lot of people to the problem,” Charles Forsberg, a research scientist at M.I.T., told me. “And if you assign several hundred engineers to the problem you will learn very, very rapidly.” Forsberg spent his early career as a researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory before moving to M.I.T., where he is overseeing the construction of a molten-salt loop that will run along the side of the campus’s research reactor. He is also one of three engineers who, in 2002, hashed out the concept for a fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor, or F.H.R. That involved taking Weinberg’s molten-salt reactor and swapping the liquid-fuel loop for a more conventional core design, while still using molten salt as a coolant. This change simplified the most vexing problems, of corrosion and containment, while preserving the high process heat that molten salt makes possible. The F.H.R. has played a significant role in rekindling interest in molten salt for fission reactors in the United States—which is the reason that Forsberg initially travelled to China to meet with the SINAP team.

Forsberg’s travel, and the relationship that he developed with Xu Hongjie and other researchers at SINAP, took place at the outset of a relatively recent period of collaboration between the U.S. and China. The partnership was formed under the framework of a 2011 “memorandum of understanding” between the Department of Energy and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which provided for coöperation on nuclear technologies. That agreement was based on a previous agreement, from 2006, which had cleared the way for U.S. nuclear firms to sell reactors to China. Both stemmed from the desire of each country to leverage the other to revamp its own nuclear industry.

China had only a handful of reactors in the early two-thousands, but in 2007 its planners had vowed to massively increase nuclear-energy production by 2020. That meant building something like forty new reactors in about fifteen years—a pace and scale only matched by the U.S. nuclear industry in the twentieth century. To meet that goal, China intended to buy the first fleet of new reactors from foreign companies, under contracts that required significant technology transfer. Although this now looks like a mixed bargain, at the time, the U.S. nuclear industry was only too happy to take it. The industry had just weathered a quarter century of effectively zero domestic demand for new reactors, and had hundreds of experts unable to put their skills to use. These were “a bunch of old Navy nuke guys, or guys that studied nuclear engineering forty years ago, who knew a ton about aging management and cracking piping and corroding pumps and things like that,” David Fishman, then a partner at a boutique China-based nuclear consultancy, told me. “They were just so pleased to come over and find a young, eager market and industry that was planning to build dozens of reactors.”

U.S.-China coöperation on molten-salt research proceeded under conditions not so different from the commercial melee. Forsberg and his collaborators—Per Peterson, a nuclear engineering professor at Berkeley, and Paul Pickard, formerly of Sandia National Laboratories—had pursued their design through academia for years, using oil or water to simulate molten salt, which is expensive and difficult to acquire in the United States. Then, in 2011, they were awarded a major multi-university grant from the Department of Energy which ultimately allowed them to start running tests with the real thing. That became a useful point of connection for Xu and his team, who had recently received a major grant from the Chinese government. The SINAP group was created to build a liquid-fuel reactor, with hopes of eventually fulfilling Weinberg’s vision of making a thorium breeder. To create some common ground with the Americans, they also committed to building a salt-cooled reactor like the F.H.R.—the project that the D.O.E. was most interested in at the time.

You can see the early dynamic of U.S.-China coöperation play out in a video of SINAP’s first presentation at Berkeley, delivered in August, 2012. As the institute’s representative, SINAP sent Kun Chen, who had done his Ph.D. at Indiana University and was still in his thirties. The audience skewed much older: about two-thirds of them looked to be in their fifties or sixties. The attendees tried to suss out the practicality of SINAP’s ambitious plan. One man asked about the budget, which was about three hundred and fifty million dollars, spread over five years. Another man asked where SINAP planned to get molten salt, since “to my understanding, there are no facilities in the world that can produce” it. Chen replied that China had several facilities that could.

It’s hard to tell from the video what the Chinese side got out of these exchanges, but when I spoke with Chen he stressed how helpful it was to have interlocutors in the U.S. “From the start, we didn’t believe we could get this far,” he said. Molten salt was no less niche in China than it was anywhere else. Chen estimated that, back in 2011, there were only thirty or forty people in the whole world working seriously on using the substance for fission reactors. Connecting with some of those individuals in the U.S. made the project seem possible.

For the Americans, there was the curiosity of seeing how far the Chinese could go with resources that simply didn’t exist here. Coöperating with SINAP was also a way to prod the U.S. federal government. The logic was “If the Chinese are doing it, it must be relevant,” Forsberg said.

In that sense, the coöperative research-and-development agreement that Oak Ridge signed with SINAP cut out the middleman. To fund the molten-salt loop, SINAP paid Oak Ridge around four million dollars, according to Chen. With such a loop, researchers could test materials and all the plumbing components needed to circulate molten salt. The project also gave a focal point to people working on molten salt in the U.S. Speaking to a reporter from the MIT Technology Review, David Holcomb explained his motivations. “One of the important things to realize is that a number of key people in molten-salt reactors are retiring very fast or passing away,” he said. “China is providing the funding that allows us to transfer that knowledge, to gain practical experience at building and operating these reactors.”

That article ran in August, 2016. By 2018, the U.S. had withdrawn from almost all coöperation with China. “I wouldn’t say it’s a total surprise,” Chen told me. He and the SINAP team figured that the relationship would probably deteriorate under Trump. “But it was just happening very suddenly. It’s similar to what we have learned in the tariff issue.”

I asked Chen if he ran into any challenges once his team was going it alone. “The challenges are, I think, mostly, first of all, if you have the money,” he said. But the SINAP team certainly had that. The Chinese Academy of Sciences had been extending the project’s grant every year. By 2018, China promised three billion dollars for molten-salt reactors over the next two decades, while Chinese planners have called for a $1.3 trillion investment in nuclear energy as a whole by 2050.

During Chen’s first presentation at Berkeley, in August, 2012, one of the few young people to ask him a question was a man with a shock of dark brown hair and an ample goatee. I had watched the recording several times before I realized the man was Mike Laufer, who would go on to help found Kairos Power, a privately held nuclear company that is attempting to commercialize the fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor originally designed by Forsberg, Pickard, and Peterson, who is also a co-founder of Kairos. Once I recognized Laufer, his question to Chen, about “the biggest challenges or obstacles to overcome” in order to build a salt-cooled reactor, had a new resonance. Was Laufer, who at the time was a graduate student at the university, already putting together a business plan?

Kairos represents a new era for the U.S. nuclear industry. Inspired by SpaceX, it is effectively trying to rebuild U.S. industrial capacity within a single company. The business model calls for a vertically integrated network of facilities that can fabricate fuel and salt for Kairos, and can manufacture a large share of what the company needs to build its reactors. The hope behind all this is that by running things internally Kairos will be able to offer nuclear energy at a competitive price in the market. And it has had some success. Last year, Google committed to buying five hundred megawatts from the firm by 2035. Kairos is also one of only two U.S. companies with a permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a new reactor. Construction of the reactor building, located in Oak Ridge, broke ground last year. “We’re working to get that reactor up and running this decade,” Laufer told me.","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/69431caccd2701eb86520635/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jones_ThoriumReactor_GettyImages-639357208.jpg",N,,2025-12-18 23:58:07.959163

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.

The bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.

Critics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines and wind and solar projects on federal land.

Speaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA, but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.

“What was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said.

After the bill’s passage through the House on Thursday, the SPEED Act’s Democratic cosponsor, Golden, praised the bill’s success.

“The simplest way to make energy, housing, and other essentials more affordable is to make it possible to actually produce enough of it at a reasonable cost,” Golden said in a press release following the vote. “The SPEED Act has united workers, businesses, and political forces who usually oppose each other because scarcity hurts everyone.”

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill aims to reform the NEPA process in several key ways. First, it makes changes to the ways agencies comply with NEPA—for example, by creating exemptions to when a NEPA review is required, and requiring agencies to only consider environmental impacts that are directly tied to the project at hand.

It would also drastically shorten the deadline to sue a federal agency over its permitting decision and constrain who is eligible to file suit. Current law provides a six-year statute of limitations on agency decisions for permitting energy infrastructure, and two years for transportation project permits. Under the SPEED Act’s provisions, those deadlines would be shortened to a mere 150 days and only allow lawsuits to be filed by plaintiffs who demonstrated in public comment periods that they would be directly and negatively impacted by the project.

NEPA does not require the government to make particular decisions about whether or how to move forward with a project based on a review’s findings. However, critics argue that in the decades since its passage, interest groups have “weaponized” the NEPA process to delay or even doom projects they oppose, sometimes forcing agencies to conduct additional analyses that add costly delays to project timelines.

Strange Bedfellows on Either Side of the Bill

Although climate activists and environmental groups have used NEPA to oppose fossil fuel projects, such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, oil and gas interests are far from the only group seeking respite. Some voices within the clean energy industry have called for permitting reform too, arguing that delays stemming from the current permitting process have had a negative impact on America’s ability to build out more climate-friendly projects, including some offshore wind projects and transmission lines to connect renewables to the grid.

So when Westerman and Golden introduced the SPEED Act in the House, a hodgepodge of odd alliances and opposition groups formed in response.

The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, launched a seven-figure advertising campaign in recent months pushing lawmakers to pursue permitting reform, according to a report from Axios. And the bill also initially enjoyed support from voices within the clean power industry. However, last-minute changes to the bill—designed to win over Republican holdouts—undermined the SPEED Act’s cross-sector support.

The bill’s opponents had previously raised alarm bells that fossil fuel interests would disproportionately benefit from a more streamlined review process under the current administration, citing President Donald Trump’s ongoing war against wind and solar energy projects.

In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to pause, reconsider or revoke already approved permits for renewable energy projects it dislikes. Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.

A bipartisan amendment to the SPEED Act, added during the Natural Resources Committee’s markup in November, sought to address some of those concerns by adding language that would make it more difficult for the administration to “revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere” with an existing authorization.

However, that measure encountered resistance from key Republican voices who support Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects.

A Last-Minute Loophole for Trump’s Energy Agenda

On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in the Rules Committee were able to amend the SPEED Act in a way that would facilitate the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to axe renewable energy projects. The changes were spearheaded by Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), two vocal proponents of Trump’s energy policies. The amendment fundamentally undermined the technology-neutral aspirations of the bill—and any hope of receiving widespread support from moderate Democrats or the clean power industry.

According to Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, Harris and Van Drew’s amendment would allow the administration to exclude any project from the bill’s reforms that the Trump administration had flagged for reconsideration—something the administration has done repeatedly for renewable projects like offshore wind.

The result, Davis argued, is that the bill would speed up the environmental review process for the Trump administration’s preferred sources of energy—namely oil and gas—while leaving clean energy projects languishing.

“They couldn’t pass the rule on Tuesday to even consider this bill without making it even better for the fossil fuel industry and even worse for the clean energy industry,” Davis said.

In a public statement following Thursday’s vote, Davis described the amended SPEED Act as “a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk to help big polluters.”

The American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable energy industry, previously hailed the bill as an important step forward for the future of clean energy development. But after the Rules Committee’s changes on Tuesday, the organization dropped its support.

“Our support for permitting reform has always rested on one principle: fixing a broken system for all energy resources,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a Wednesday statement. “The amendment adopted last night violate[s] that principle. Technology neutrality wasn’t just good policy—it was the political foundation that made reform achievable.”

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a nonprofit trade and advocacy organization, echoed that sentiment.

“Durable, bipartisan, technology-neutral permitting reforms that support and advance the full suite of American electricity resources and the necessary expansion of transmission infrastructure to get that electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed are essential to meeting that challenge reliably, securely, and most importantly, affordably,” said ACORE CEO Ray Long. “Unfortunately, the changes made on the House floor are a disappointing step backward from achieving these objectives.”

Following the SPEED Act’s passage through the House on Thursday, advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) issued a public statement praising the bill’s success while noting how the recent amendments had affected the law.

“While we are concerned that post committee additions to the bill could put the certainty of a range of projects at risk, this bill’s underlying reforms are critical to advancing American energy,” CRES President Heather Reams said in the statement.

Mixed Expectations for the Reform’s Impact

Even before the move to strip protections for renewables from the bill, some critics—like Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—said that the legislation didn’t go far enough to curtail the president’s “all-out assault” against clean power, arguing that the bill does nothing to restore approvals that have already been canceled by the administration, and doesn’t address other roadblocks that have been put in place.

“The administration cannot be trusted to act without specific language, in my view, to protect the clean energy projects already in the pipeline and to prevent the Interior Secretary from unilaterally stopping projects that are needed to lower costs and improve grid reliability,” Levin told Inside Climate News in an interview ahead of the House vote.

Both Levin and Davis pointed to a July memo from the Department of Interior that requires all wind and solar projects on federal land to receive higher-level approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“The administration is not even returning the phone calls of project developers. They are not responding to applications being submitted,” Davis said. “That sort of approach is in stark contrast with the ‘white glove, concierge service’—and that’s a quote from the Trump administration—the service they are providing for fossil fuel companies to access our public lands.”

The SPEED Act’s opponents also dispute the idea that NEPA reviews are one of the primary causes of permitting delays, arguing that reports from the Congressional Research Service and other groups have found little evidence to support those claims.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute, in a September interview with Inside Climate News.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said, like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Debate over NEPA and the reform of the permitting process will now move into the Senate, where experts say the SPEED Act will likely undergo further changes.

“I think as the bill goes forwards in the Senate, we’ll probably see a neutral, across-the-board approach to making sure the process is fair for all technology types,” Xan Fishman, an energy policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center told ICN after Thursday’s vote.

Fishman stressed it would be crucial to ensure permits for projects wouldn’t suddenly be cancelled for political reasons, but said he was optimistic about how the SPEED Act would be refined in the Senate.

“It’s great to see Congress so engaged with permitting reform,” he said. “Both sides of the aisle see a need to do better.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2242254350-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:10.757368

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit.","The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec. 17 delivered a proposed rule to set 45Z clean fuel production credit guidance to the White House Office of Management and Budget. OMB review marks a final stage before a proposed rule is released for public comment.

According to information released by the OMB, the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) includes guidance regarding 45Z implementation, including the calculation of emissions factors for transportation fuel, the determination of clean fuel production credits, and producer registration.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly when compared to last year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.

Also in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is designed specifically to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions to meet the requirements of section 45Z.

The DOE in July 2025 issued a notice soliciting public comments on a preliminary plan for determining provisional emissions rates (PER) for the purposes of the 45Z clean fuel production credit. A PER must be determined for any fuel not addressed in the emissions rate tables.

According to information published by the OMB, the upcoming NPRM is expected to address public comments gathered by Treasury and the IRS in response to the January 2025 notices. “These notices were published in early 2025 to meet the statutory deadline of January 1, 2025, however the rules need to be further formalized in an NPRM and then finalized,” according to the OMB’s summary of the NPRM.

""Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project,"" the company said.
Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its decision to suspend development, which marks an abrupt shift by the developer.
Energy Transfer, which said it wanted to sell down about 80% of the equity in the Lake Charles project, had also said it was in advanced talks with potential partners.
Earlier this year, Energy Transfer had expanded its long-term contract with offtaker Chevron to 3 million mt/year and signed a long-term deal with Japan's Kyushu Electric for 1 million mt/year.","Energy Transfer has suspended the development of its proposed 16.5 million metric ton/year Lake Charles LNG export project in Louisiana, the company said Dec. 18.

The US pipeline giant announced the move in a brief statement, saying it made the decision ""to focus on allocating capital to its significant backlog of natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects that Energy Transfer believes provides superior risk/return profiles."" In a separate statement, the company said it has increased the diameter of its planned Desert Southwest Pipeline to 48 inches in response to strong demand in a recent open season.

The company suggested it would be open to turning the Lake Charles project over to another developer.

""Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project,"" the company said.

The decision to halt development of Lake Charles comes amid expectations of an LNG oversupply in the late 2020s and early 2030s, around the time the long-delayed project was expected to come online.

Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its decision to suspend development, which marks an abrupt shift by the developer.

In early November, Energy Transfer said it was ""very close"" to realizing its target of signing 15 million-15.5 million mt/y of project volumes under long-term contract.

Some of the deals it had signed were preliminary agreements that the developer still needed to convert into binding deals.

Energy Transfer, which said it wanted to sell down about 80% of the equity in the Lake Charles project, had also said it was in advanced talks with potential partners. Energy Transfer co-CEO Marshall McCrea had described the targeted sell-down as ""the last big, most important box"" before launching the project, speaking during a Nov. 5 earnings call.

Counterparties included the US-based LNG player MidOcean, which is managed by EIG and backed by Saudi Aramco. Energy Transfer in April signed a preliminary deal that would have seen MidOcean commit to funding 30% of the construction costs of the project and receive the same share of LNG offtake from the facility, or about 5 million mt/year.

Earlier this year, Energy Transfer had expanded its long-term contract with offtaker Chevron to 3 million mt/year and signed a long-term deal with Japan's Kyushu Electric for 1 million mt/year.

This year, final investment decisions on new US liquefaction projects have already reached an all-time high. Six US LNG projects have reached an FID in 2025, bringing the total liquefaction capacity approved this year to around 60 million mt/y. US projects represent a majority of the 84 million mt/y to reach FID globally during the year.

Desert Southwest

Upsizing the Desert Southwest Pipeline from 42 inches to 48 inches will increase capacity to ""up to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day, depending on final compression configuration,"" Energy Transfer said.

Desert Southwest is an expansion of the Transwestern Pipeline system. It involves roughly 516 miles of greenfield pipeline running from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Phoenix area in Arizona. Its planned in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2029 is unchanged.

When Energy Transfer reached FID on the project in August, it planned for a 42-inch pipeline and a capacity of 1.5 Bcf/d. At the time, executives expressed confidence that it could be upsized, even though the original 1.5 Bcf/d had not yet been fully subscribed.

Energy Transfer increased the size after a supplemental open season. ""There is significant demand growth in the Desert Southwest region, including the potential to retire and or convert coal-fired power plants to natural gas, which could further benefit the project,"" it said. ""The ultimate capacity of the Desert Southwest expansion project will be based on market demand.""

Shippers on Desert Southwest include Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project and Arizona G&T Cooperatives.

The expansion will ""enable us to meet the region's growing power needs and strengthen Arizona's energy infrastructure,"" Bobby Olsen, SRP's chief power system executive, said in the statement.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 19:59:18.003301

“We’re proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.” About Entergy Arkansas Entergy Arkansas provides electricity to approximately 735,000 customers in 63 counties.
We’re also investing in cleaner energy generation like modern natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy.","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Entergy Arkansas today announced Next Generation Arkansas, the company’s comprehensive plan to provide electricity that does more for Arkansas by strengthening reliability, expanding energy supply, driving economic growth and keeping power affordable for all customers. The company, and its more than 2,800 employees, are focusing the plan and their efforts in the coming years on helping keep the state and its customers out in front of the emerging electric future developing in the U.S. and globally.

“Next Generation Arkansas is about preparing our state for what’s ahead. By strengthening the grid, adding new generation and modernizing how we deliver power, we’re making the system more reliable and more affordable while also building a system that enables unprecedented growth over the long term,” said Laura Landreaux, Entergy Arkansas president and CEO. “These investments help prevent outages, support new jobs and ensure that Arkansas families and businesses continue to benefit from low, predictable electricity costs as our state grows.”

Next Generation Arkansas is a multi-faceted plan that includes input from state and local leaders and Entergy Arkansas customers across the state to ensure transparency, accountability and open dialogue about affordability and how to best meet their needs. The plan represents the company’s response to several power-related issues facing the state:

Recent state growth requiring more power to serve customers;

More extreme weather in recent years affecting customer reliability;

Increasing state competitiveness for job-creating projects; and

Cost pressures requiring new approaches to keep rates low for customers.

To meet this demand, Next Generation Arkansas has been built around four core priorities, detailed below.

Better power for Arkansas: Fewer outages, faster repairs

Entergy Arkansas is launching one of the most ambitious reliability improvement plans in recent history designed to make the power grid stronger and more reliable with an initial goal to reduce power outages by at least 30% over the coming years.

In addition to increasing vegetation investments that will keep power lines clear, the company is performing reliability improvement projects across the state and deploying new, advanced technology tools that will help spot problems faster, prevent challenges and improve power quality for decades to come.

The economic growth the company is helping enable is adding new large customers to the grid that helps offset the costs of these improvements for existing customers.

More power for Arkansas: Power when and where needed to meet soaring demand

Arkansas was recently ranked the fastest-growing state economy in America for two quarters in a row, the No. 1 state for inbound movers, and the state with the lowest cost of living. Arkansas is already expected to see more than a 35% increase in power needs in the next five years, and with projections showing that figure could more than double, Entergy Arkansas is acting now to build the next generation of power sources to support the state’s growth and serve its customers while keeping rates affordable.

To do this, Entergy Arkansas plans to invest in approximately 2,600 MW of new, more fuel-efficient generation resources and repower approximately 1,600 MW of existing generation in the next five years pending approval from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, including:

Investing in new, modern natural gas plants to increase fuel efficiency by up to 40%, which lowers fuel charges on customer bills:

450 MW at the new Ironwood Power Station natural gas plant in Hot Spring County (2028).

750 MW at the new Jefferson Power Station natural gas plant in Jefferson County (2029).

600 MW of solar + 350 MW of battery storage at the Arkansas Cypress facility in Jefferson County (2028), which will provide clean, renewable power that lowers fuel charges on customer bills.

Retrofitting coal-fired generators to burn natural gas and extend their lives.

Investing in upgrades at existing natural gas facilities to increase output more than 150 MW.

Renewing the license to generate 1,800 MW of clean, reliable 24/7 energy produced by the Arkansas Nuclear One power plant and investing in new, more efficient plant equipment that increases the output of the facility.

These investments will ensure Arkansas has a balanced, more cost-efficient, “all-of-the-above” energy mix needed to support homes, businesses and new industries.

Job power for Arkansas: Helping the state recruit more and better jobs

Arkansas offers a strong pro-business environment, and over the past five years, Entergy Arkansas has partnered with state and community leaders to drive the creation of more than 7,500 jobs and over $13 billion in capital investments. As electricity becomes a key factor in securing new business, the state must continue delivering the power infrastructure and site development needed to compete. When structured strategically, these private investments not only generate tax revenue and quality jobs, but also provide broader benefits for Arkansans, including bill savings and a more reliable grid. The company plans to do this by:

Using the blueprint created by the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025 to work at the speed needed to compete nationally for once-in-a-generation tech and industrial projects.

Bolstering local job impact – Arkansas building Arkansas – by using local contractors and companies around the state whenever possible, reinvesting growth back into our communities through new jobs, state and local tax revenue, and indirect economic impact.

Creating economic impact while implementing the plan – for example, the development of the Ironwood, Jefferson Power Station and Arkansas Cypress power plants would create approximately 1,860 direct jobs as well as significantly more indirect jobs during construction, provide 46 permanent jobs during operation, and that will generate more than $105 million in new local and state tax revenue by 2030.

“We want to commend state leaders for passing the Generating Jobs Act of 2025, which is a landmark legislation and shows what’s possible when Arkansas sets a bold vision for its future, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission for approving the new associated rider,” Landreaux said. “Because of the state’s leadership, Arkansas has the tools to compete for once-in-a-generation opportunities. We are committed to delivering a power system that attracts new jobs, strengthens communities, and keeps our state moving forward for the next generation of Arkansans.”

Affordable power for Arkansas: Keeping rates low and predictable

Entergy Arkansas’s rates remain 22% below the national average, and the company plans to continue finding ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and offer innovative bill solutions to keep power affordable for all customers, even as the company invests in the state’s growth including:

Leveraging new policies to help build the power system Arkansas needs while keeping rate stable and predictable.

Using new technologies to help manage the grid and prevent outages at less cost to customers.

Providing customers with ways to lower their bills with new rate structures and by helping them access resources like free home energy checkups, free and discounted energy-saving products, and rebates on energy-efficient equipment purchases.

Continuing to recruit new large industrial customers to help spread the cost of maintaining and upgrading the power grid across a larger customer base and reduce the burden on residents and small businesses.

Working with new large customer partners to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives and encourage others to provide community support, as Google has with its $25 million Energy Impact Fund.

All of these efforts will be managed with transparency for customers and with direct oversight from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Landreaux said.

“Our 2,800 Entergy employees in Arkansas and I understand that this is some of the most important work of our careers, and we feel it personally because we’re Arkansans too,” Landreaux said. “We’re proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.”

The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act (H.R. 1366) streamlines critical mineral production and creates the Abandoned Hardrock Mine Fund to support an abandoned hardrock mine cleanup program created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.

“The bill I passed in Congress today puts Nevada’s natural resources to work for Nevadans,” Rep. Horsford said. “Streamlining the hardrock mining process will create good jobs and strengthen our energy sector. At the same time, this legislation delivers more resources for the Silver State to clean up past mining-related contaminants in our environment. The result is more jobs, a stronger economy, and an opportunity for a cleaner Nevada moving forward.”

“Strengthening our domestic mineral supply chain isn’t optional, it’s demanded to ensure we don’t fall further behind China,”Rep. Amodei said. “Western states are sitting on a wealth of resources and a critical opportunity to break our dangerous reliance on foreign adversaries while powering our own economy. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act restores decades of established precedent, repairs a permitting process undermined by the Rosemont decision, and gives domestic mining operations the certainty they need to compete aggressively and win. I’m glad to see the House pass this bill once again with bipartisan support, and I urge the Senate to act swiftly to get it signed into law.”

“The bipartisan Mining Regulatory Clarity Act is foundationally important to ensuring the U.S. can use our vast domestic resources to build the mineral supply chains our economic and national security demand,” Rich Nolan, National Mining Association President and CEO said. “China has weaponized its mineral dominance and left no doubt about how untenable our import reliance has become. The urgency to address our minerals challenge has never been greater. This legislation ensures the fundamental ability to conduct responsible mining activities on federal lands. Regulatory certainty, or the lack thereof, will either underpin or undermine efforts to decisively confront our minerals crisis.”

“The Nevada Mining Association is in full support of the passage of the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act,” Amanda Hilton, Nevada Mining Association President said. “As the importance of strengthening domestic supply chains continues to grow, this legislation provides clear guidance for mine operations in Nevada and across the United States to responsibly produce the minerals needed here at home, support national security, and provide good-paying careers for American workers.”

The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act now moves to the U.S. Senate where Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto introduced companion legislation.

Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.
Thursday’s order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.
Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.
It requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation’s largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

But it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.

It also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.

Laura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday’s meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”

It would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.

Power plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday’s trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.

Jeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.

Thursday’s order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

For tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.

But utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.

FERC’s Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.

It requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.

That could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.

The order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.

To wrap it up… In every way, 2025 was a challenging year for protecting our coasts and ocean.","The Surfrider team, volunteers, and supporters knew from the onset that this year was not going to be easy. We expected efforts by the federal administration to weaken coastal and ocean protections, but what we experienced was unprecedented. From cutting regulations that limit pollution and development in our waterways, to rescinding funding for critical coastal and marine monitoring programs, to the most aggressive ocean sell-off to offshore oil drilling in more than half a century, the onslaught of challenges delivered by our federal government kept us busy.

Watch our 2025 year in review video

Then there were ‘drop everything’ unforeseen circumstances, like the LA fires, that for a while sucked the energy out of our grassroots efforts to be effective stewards of that coast. Meanwhile, the visible challenges persisted — plastic pollution, the water quality crisis on the US-Mexico border, and our rapidly eroding shorelines.

We could have tried to look past the obstacles that stood in the way of our mission in 2025, but that’s not what we do. Instead, we faced them head-on and played into our strengths even harder to protect what we love.

Surfrider has the unique ability to scale and adapt to be effective, from the halls of Congress all the way to your local beach. When there is little opportunity to be proactive on federal policies that protect our coasts and ocean in Washington, D.C., we continue to mobilize in Sacramento, Tallahassee, Eugene, Albany, and other state capitals across the country. While we have watched the momentum for a swift transition to renewable energy decline, our network of volunteers has activated to restore our coastlines, in the wetlands, dunes, and mangroves, as a nature-based solution to the changing climate.

In 2025, the Surfrider network doubled down on opportunities to make progress on the ground, in the local councils, and in the state capitols, while still defending the bedrock federal protections in place for our coasts and ocean. Several state plastic pollution prevention bills were passed after years of effort. We won more than 20 local campaigns across the country with the leadership of Surfrider’s chapters. Volunteers turned out in the tens of thousands to give nature a boost by restoring coastal ecosystems.

Despite the challenges and the absence of federal leadership for healthy coastlines, this was still a year of incredible impact for Surfrider and our coasts.

Here are some of Surfrider’s major achievements of 2025:

45 campaign victories were won at the local, state, and federal levels that improve water quality on our beaches, reduce plastic pollution, protect ocean ecosystems, and strengthen the resilience of our coastlines through nature-based solutions.

More than 23,000 Surfrider volunteers removed 120,633 pounds of trash and recycling from U.S. beaches and waterways.

More than 40,000 native plants were installed across 22 acres of coastal dunes and mangrove forests.

Through 97 Ocean Friendly Garden workdays, 2,905 native plants and trees were planted, achieving more than 26 acres of Ocean Friendly Gardens that filter 23.8 million gallons of runoff annually.

Volunteers conducted more than 10,000 Blue Water Task Force water quality tests at 613 sampling sites.

In 30 states and territories, 646 Ocean Friendly Restaurants served an estimated 42 million single-use plastic-free meals.

An estimated 1.8 million plastic water bottles and 2.7 million mini plastic toiletry bottles were saved from polluting our communities, waterways, and landfills by 40 Ocean Friendly Hotels.

Plastic Pollution

In 2025, the issue of plastic pollution on our beaches persisted, as noted by the 120,633 pounds of trash and recycling that were removed through Surfrider’s 831 cleanups. On the fifth of July alone, more than 10,000 pounds of trash were cleaned up. All of this was captured in Surfrider’s Beach Cleanup Report, which found that 83% of the 870,000 pieces of trash analyzed in 2024 were plastic.

Turning off the tap on plastic pollution is the only effective way to make an impact on this issue, and market solutions play a major role. This year, Surfrider’s Ocean FriendlyBusinesses network grew to 646 Ocean Friendly Restaurants in 30 states and territories, serving an estimated 42 million single-use plastic-free meals every year. New businesses were added as Ocean Friendly Hotels, now 40 in total, collectively eliminating about 1.8 million plastic water bottles and 2.7 million mini plastic toiletry bottles from polluting our communities, waterways, and landfills.

While the federal administration’s priorities blocked any efforts to pass meaningful plastic pollution reduction legislation in DC, Surfrider still successfully achieved 14 coastal victories in states and cities around the country. Together, these victories resulted in more than 862 million single-use plastic items taken out of circulation.

One example was Washington’s Recycling Reform Act, which reduces the amount of plastic pollution found on the state’s beaches and improves access to recycling. Another was in Oregon, where Surfrider successfully waged the Beyond the Bag Ban campaign, a statewide effort to eliminate thicker plastic check-out bags from grocery stores. Oregon is the second state in the US, after California, to pass a stronger bag ban.

Additionally, Surfrider defeated a dangerous Florida state bill that would have expanded the state's preemption on the local regulation of single-use plastic and reusable materials, containers, bottles, and bags. In the California cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola, Surfrider helped pass ‘Ban the Butt’ ordinances that end the sale of filtered tobacco products, the number one item found at Surfrider’s beach cleanups. In New Jersey, four local campaigns were won to require the containment and removal of plastic particles and dust at construction sites.

A lot of wins for eliminating needless plastic waste and the impacts it has on our coasts and ocean.

Coasts and Climate

There were significant threats at the federal level in 2025 to upend bedrock ocean protection laws, climate programs, and funding for coastal management. Even so, Surfrider demonstrated in real time how coastal communities and ecosystems can not only survive, but thrive with nature-based solutions. By working with nature and leaning into community voices and expertise, Surfrider worked swiftly to make real progress on local and state coastal resilience policy and project opportunities.

In 2025, Surfrider’s Climate Action Program came to life as a frontline defense against coastal erosion and the impacts of climate change. By restoring blue carbon mangrove forests, coastal dunes, and riparian habitats, Surfrider is adding decades of resilience to coastlines across the country while enhancing habitat and coastal access. A total of 76 restoration events were carried out across more than 22 acres of coastline in Hawaii, California, Florida, Puerto Rico, North Carolina, New York, New Hampshire, Maine, and Wisconsin, with the support of more than 2,000 volunteers. Collectively, these volunteers installed over 40,000 native plants and removed more than 85,000 pounds of invasives.

Meanwhile, the finishing touches were put on the Surfers’ Point Managed Retreat Project in Ventura, California. This project has become the gold standard in the application of nature-based solutions to address coastal erosion and climate change preparedness. By leveraging the success of Surfers’ Point and years of community organizing, Surfrider secured a state grant of $1 million to design and apply a similar approach to the rapidly eroding and beloved ‘Surf Beach’ at San Onofre State Beach in Southern California.

Surfrider won eleven local and state campaigns in 2025 to better equip our coasts for a changing climate. In Oregon, Surfrider advanced its multi-year Oregon Beaches Forever campaign aimed at safeguarding the state’s public beaches as they try to adapt to climate change. Four state and local wins were achieved in Oregon that advance nature-based solutions, promote climate-forward planning, and protect beaches against destructive riprap.

In Florida, Surfrider helped pass a state bill to provide long-term protections for state parks, including coastal areas, against harmful development projects. On the legal front, Surfrider’s amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) support led to a significant victory for California coasts in a case that properly limits armoring on California coastlines, consistent with the California Coastal Act.

To help scale proven coastal resilience, climate action, and nature-based tools, policies, and projects, Surfrider's 2025 State of the Beach Report highlighted case studies from around the country that can be replicated and applied along coastlines facing similar management challenges.

Clean Water

While protections for water quality at our beaches and waterways were also targeted by the federal administration’s efforts to reduce environmental regulations, in 2025, Surfrider worked tirelessly to safeguard the programs that keep us and our families safe when we visit the coast. Eleven clean water campaigns were won at the local, state, and federal levels. This includes having successfully advocated for congressional support for the EPA’s Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, or BEACH Act, which provides national grants to coastal states to run their beach water quality monitoring and public notification programs. The program is critical to provide families with the information they need to stay safe at the beach and to safeguard our valuable coastal economies.

At the state level, Surfrider helped pass a Washington bill that requires public notification of sewage spills. Other state bills that passed in 2025 include: solutions for new wastewater system technology in Hawaii; a ban on the use of Neonicotinoids, a class of synthetic, neurotoxic insecticides in Connecticut; and protections for recreational water quality against seafood processing wastewater discharge in Oregon.

Meanwhile, to address the ongoing public health and environmental crisis at the US-Mexico border, Surfrider and its coalition partners successfully advocated for more federal investment in border sewage infrastructure operations, maintenance, and capital improvements.

The role of Surfrider’s clean water programs has become more important than ever to help fill the gaps where governments are lacking the capacity or political will to address pollution issues. The Blue Water Task Force, the nation’s largest volunteer-driven beach water quality monitoring program, is now testing water quality at 613 sampling sites on beaches and waterways around the country. In 2025, volunteers ran more than 10,000 water quality tests. A total of 107,000 tests have been completed over the program’s 30-year history.

To identify and fix the sources of pollution identified through the Blue Water Task Force, multiple Surfrider chapters are working collaboratively in their local communities. This includes projects in San Mateo, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura Counties, California; Eastern Long Island, New York; Melbourne and Miami, Florida; Newport, Oregon; Kaua’i and O’ahu, Hawaii; and Rincón and Isabela, Puerto Rico.

Surfrider’s Ocean Friendly Gardens program is helping people across the country reimagine and transform landscapes, yards, and community green spaces with nature-based solutions that protect clean water, build biodiversity, and support climate resilience. In 2025, Surfrider led 97 Ocean Friendly Garden workdays during which volunteers planted 2,905 native plants and trees. Across the country, there are now more than 26 acres of Ocean Friendly Gardens that filter 23.1 million gallons of runoff annually.

Surfrider also developed a new digital resource, Re-planting After Fire: A Fire-Resilient Landscape Guide for Lahaina & West Maui, to help residents in the Maui community affected by the devastating 2023 fires create and maintain landscapes that are fire-resilient, environmentally responsible, and ocean-friendly.

Finally, Surfrider secured two significant legal wins in the courts for clean water in 2025. Hawai’i’s Supreme Court held in Surfrider and our partners’ favor in Kaua’i to help end the use of dangerous pesticides in Hawaii. Meanwhile, in another federal case, the courts concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must make better decisions when setting water pollution standards for industrial facilities.

Beach Access

In 2025, among the many unique challenges to beach access in the US, there were coastal erosion, Space X launches, the privatization of coastal parking, and climate change. Surfrider won six coastal victories to help address threats to coastal access in California, Texas, Florida, and Hawaii while monitoring dozens more.

In California, through the Love Your Beach tour, Surfrider mobilized the public to advocate against threats to weaken or abolish the state’s Coastal Act, a landmark law that protects the state’s 1,100-mile coastline. With stops from San Diego to Sacramento, the tour collected more than 1,500 signatures from 100 different California districts, all in support of the crucial coastal environmental and access protection law.

Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, Surfrider successfully supported the repeal of Florida legislation that preempted local jurisdictions from protecting the public’s customary use rights to recreate on Florida beaches.

Ocean Protection

On January 6, 2025, President Biden announced the withdrawal of the entire US East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and part of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska from future oil and gas leasing. The historic action protected more than 625 million acres of U.S. waters from oil and gas development. The Surfrider network celebrated this incredible victory.

However, following the change in administrations, the White House reversed President Biden's ban and initiated an onslaught of policies, proposals, and plans to sell off our ocean resources. Surfrider quickly filed litigation with our coalition partners to restore these protections. These cases remain ongoing and may extend for years, reinforcing the importance of Surfrider’s grassroots advocacy.

While persistently on the defensive, Surfrider helped achieve two major proactive ocean protection victories in 2025. The 582,570 square-mile Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Sanctuary in Hawaiʻi was established, becoming one of the largest marine protected areas in the world. The sanctuary safeguards coral reefs, seamounts, and shoals that are home to diverse marine wildlife, including invertebrates, fish, birds, and marine mammals, including many endemic species.

Surfrider helped strengthen the protection of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, home to the only barrier coral reef in the continental US, in addition to seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and diverse marine wildlife. The sanctuary’s Restoration Blueprint expands the sanctuary by 739 square miles to more than 4,530 square miles of protected marine ecosystems.

While these wins were significant, our ocean faced a dangerous new threat in 2025 — a brewing offshore drilling plan to open vast stretches of the U.S. coastline to new offshore oil and gas leases. The nearly 1.3 billion acres of ocean at risk in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s proposed five-year drilling plan, released in late November, include all federal waters off California, all of the western and portions of the eastern Gulf, and most of Alaskan waters, including the untouched High Arctic, where drilling has never been attempted because of the environmental hazards.

In anticipation of such a plan, Surfrider was ready and quickly mobilized a nationwide effort to demonstrate widespread public opposition to more offshore drilling on our coasts. Surfrider’s Drilling is Killing campaign is live, and will deliver tens of thousands of public comments to the agency through the deadline on January 23, 2026. Surfrider is engaging communities, businesses, and elected leaders in this critical comment period to build the public record of opposition to the plan.

As part of a coalition effort in California, Surfrider has organized people’s hearings in response to the absence of a public process in shaping the plan. Events in San Diego, Orange County, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Humboldt, and beyond are each turning out hundreds of ocean voices to advocate for ocean protection, and say no to new offshore drilling.

To wrap it up…

In every way, 2025 was a challenging year for protecting our coasts and ocean. New threats emerged while the persistent challenges to coastal conservation remained. Undeterred, the Surfrider network championed key coastal and ocean programs threatened with elimination or defunded by the federal administration while also taking local action on the ground.

Thanks to the dedicated volunteers, staff, and supporters from coast to coast, diverse and powerful voices were shared with our federal leadership on the importance of conserving our coastal resources. Meanwhile, every day, those same ocean defenders were safeguarding your beach through local solutions, in the field, and in the water.

We don’t expect 2026 to be any easier, but we do know that we are walking away from this year stronger than ever to confront the challenges that lie ahead.",https://www.surfrider.org/hubfs/Andrew%20Tonra.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:05.466146

AUSTIN, Texas – The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) lauded passage of H.R. 4776, The SPEED Act, in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislative effort, supported by TIPRO, will streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969.

The following statement can be attributed to Ed Longanecker, President of TIPRO:

“On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers. For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges.

Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs. And communities waiting for the economic benefits of infrastructure development, including jobs, tax revenue, and improved local services, watch opportunity pass them by. In addition, the coming AI revolution, with the need to power massive data centers across the country, will drive further demand for American natural gas. When domestic production is throttled, imports from less regulated producers fill the gap, increasing global emissions and undermining U.S. environmental standards.

For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical. It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world. At a time when energy reliability and affordability are top concerns for working Americans, we strongly encourage expedited consideration in the U.S. Senate to help reshape the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure.”

The SPEED Act: Reforming Federal Permitting to Accelerate Economic Development

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R. 4776, represents a bipartisan legislative effort to streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Introduced on July 25, 2025, by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and cosponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), the bill aims to reduce bureaucratic delays that have long hindered infrastructure, energy, and economic projects across the United States. By addressing inefficiencies in environmental reviews, the SPEED Act seeks to foster economic growth, enhance energy security, and support critical developments such as transmission lines, data centers, and manufacturing operations, while maintaining core environmental safeguards.

Key Provisions of the SPEED Act

The SPEED Act modifies NEPA to expedite approvals without eliminating environmental oversight. Notable provisions include:

Standardizing Review Processes: The bill redefines “major federal actions” to exclude designations based solely on federal funding and exempts actions already reviewed under equivalent federal, state, or tribal environmental laws.

Setting Deadlines: It imposes strict timelines for environmental assessments and impact statements, typically limiting reviews to one to two years, to prevent indefinite delays.

Limiting Judicial Review: Lawsuits challenging NEPA compliance must be filed within 150 days of final agency action, and courts are directed to remand cases for correction rather than halting projects entirely. This provision also restricts standing to parties who submitted comments during the public review process, curbing frivolous or politically motivated litigation.

Enhancing Agency Coordination: The legislation requires better interagency collaboration and focuses reviews on “proximate” effects directly caused by the project, excluding speculative or unrelated impacts.

These reforms are designed to balance environmental protection with economic imperatives, particularly in sectors like mining, energy production, and AI infrastructure, where permitting delays have historically increased costs and deterred investment. Supporters argue that the bill will unlock domestic resources, reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, and create jobs.

The SPEED Act is particularly vital for the oil and natural gas industry, where protracted NEPA permitting processes have significantly impeded exploration, infrastructure development, and overall energy security. Over the past five decades, NEPA has evolved into a complex framework burdened by court rulings, executive directives, and agency interpretations, resulting in unpredictable delays that deter investment, stifle innovation, and increase project costs. For oil and gas exploration, these delays have stalled federal leasing and project approvals, limiting access to domestic resources and exacerbating reliance on foreign imports, which undermines national energy independence.

In terms of infrastructure, the bill addresses barriers to constructing essential facilities such as pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, and drilling operations. Permitting bottlenecks have historically prevented timely market access for crude oil and natural gas, leading to higher flaring rates and inefficient resource utilization. By imposing reasonable timelines, reducing frivolous litigation, and streamlining interagency reviews, the SPEED Act enables faster development of these projects, ensuring they are delivered on budget and supporting more efficient production methods. This is crucial for meeting growing domestic and global energy demands, particularly amid rising needs from sectors like artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

On energy security, the legislation promotes the expansion of reliable, affordable American energy supplies, generating jobs and tax revenues while potentially reducing global emissions by displacing higher-emission foreign alternatives. Overall, by cutting red tape while preserving environmental protections, the SPEED Act positions the oil and natural gas sector to contribute more effectively to national security, economic growth, and a stable energy grid.

Senate action in 2025 remains uncertain and unlikely, however reform could gain traction in 2026 as part of larger legislative packages, such as energy security or infrastructure bills, amid partisan debates on environmental policy. Advocates are pushing for Senate consideration, emphasizing the bill’s role in national security and economic competitiveness. If enacted, the SPEED Act could significantly reshape federal permitting, potentially accelerating projects critical to AI development and domestic manufacturing in the coming years.

Introduction

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments in response to the administration’s Request for Information for Accelerating the American Scientific Enterprise. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

The U.S. scientific enterprise has reached a fork in the road. While previous policy has encouraged principal investigators to pursue creativity and curiosity in conducting research, it is clear that this approach has not had the desired effect on advancing American competitiveness and strengthening America’s position in maximizing national power. The science community must move beyond the linear Science, the Endless Frontier-model of scientific research, developed and encouraged by Vannevar Bush, and realign scientific exploration with national interests, especially in the face of the growing technological and economic threat posed by China.[1]

Undertaking this shift will mean prioritizing high-impact fields such as engineering, life sciences, and computer science over those with a less-direct impact on national competitiveness, and it means more closely aligning the research and academic community with private industry, prioritizing technology transfer and commercialization over basic, curiosity-driven research.

While we hope the administration will consider ITIF’s comments and recommendations on these issues, we also would like to urge the administration to consider the bipartisan policy blueprint already developed during the first Trump administration in the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) “Return on Investment Initiative for Unleashing American Innovation” (the Green Paper). The Green Paper outlined a series of readily executable policy ideas to improve America’s technology transfer ecosystem, increase the return on investment (ROI) from research dollars, streamline federal technology regulations, and increase the competitive orientation of the scientific enterprise. We believe that the Green Paper presents a set of readily accessible and easily implementable policy ideas to advance the American Scientific Enterprise. The administration should start by reviewing and implementing the strong work it’s already done in this regard.

Responses to RFI Questions

(i) What policy changes to Federal funding mechanisms, procurement processes, or partnership authorities would enable stronger public-private collaboration and allow America to tap into its vast private sector to better drive use-inspired basic and early-stage applied research?

First and foremost, the United States must recognize that it has already built the world’s most effective system for technology commercialization, especially where it pertains to intellectual property (IP)/technologies derived from federally funded research and development (R&D) conducted at U.S. universities and research institutions. While positive reforms can still be made on the margins, the Trump administration must refrain from implementing poor IP/technology commercialization policies that unnecessarily make innovation more difficult, risky, and expensive.

In September 2025, in an Axios interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for the federal government to claim half the patent earnings from university inventions derived in part from federal R&D, erroneously asserting that “the U.S. government is getting no return on the money it invests in federal research.”[2] Yet the reality is the U.S. taxpayer—and the government—benefits greatly from this R&D funding. They benefit first from the extensive innovations produced from the academic tech transfer process, which alone has produced hundreds of life-saving drugs and vaccines, including treatments for breast, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancer, not to mention other breakthroughs in everything from Honeycrisp apples and neoprene to cloud and quantum computing. Second, university IP licensing revenues help fund key innovation-enabling infrastructure at U.S. universities, such as labs, incubators, or innovation accelerators that keep the innovation flywheel churning. Third, the government benefits from the taxes produced by the trillions in industrial output and millions of jobs created as a result of university tech transfer.[3] For instance, university research parks alone generated $33 billion in federal tax revenue in 2024.[4] The administration should refrain from imposing a claim or a tax on IP licensing revenues earned by U.S. universities.

Similarly, the administration should refrain from proposals to charge patent holders between 1 and 5 percent of a patent’s overall value. As ITIF has written, taxing patents would disincentivize innovation and harm American competitiveness all while be extraordinarily difficult to implement.[5] (It’s difficult enough for the private sector to accurately value IP, let alone a government agency doing so, and especially when debatable valuations would be tied up in litigation for years.) If the United States wishes to develop more and more useful IP—which is certainly should as a matter of technology and innovation policy—then increasing the cost of that IP through an annual tax should be a proposal summarily dispatched. Indeed, the United States should proceed in the exact option direction, such as how the United States offers lower patent filing fees for small businesses and how it has worked through patent backlogs which once took years to clear.[6]

Do not apply Bayh-Dole march in rights to control the price of resulting products. As late as 1978, the federal government had licensed less than 5 percent of the as many as 30,000 patents it owned.[7] Most of them languished on the shelves of government offices or labs. Congress transformed the situation by passing the bipartisan 1980 Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, better known as the “Bayh-Dole Act.” The legislation both created a uniform patent policy among the many federal agencies funding research and allowed universities to retain ownership of the IP and inventions made as a result of federally funded research.[8] The Bayh-Dole Act has transformed U.S. universities into engines of innovation, spawning robust academic technology transfer and commercialization capabilities and activities at hundreds of universities across the United States.[9]

In fact, the impact of academic technology transfer from U.S. universities has been so extensive that, from 1996 to 2020, it resulted in 554,000 inventions disclosed, 141,000 U.S. patents granted, and 18,000 start-ups formed.[10] Moreover, academic technology transfer has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion, contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output, and supported 6.5 million jobs over that time.[11]

When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act it included so-called “march-in right” provisions, which permit the government, in specified circumstances, to require patent holders to grant a “nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license” to a “responsible applicant or applicants.”[12] Yet some have called for the government to use Bayh-Dole march-in rights to control the price of resulting products, such as pharmaceutical drugs. This despite the fact that lower prices are not one of the rationales laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, as senators Bayh and Dole have themselves noted, the Bayh-Dole Act’s march-in rights were never intended to control or ensure “reasonable prices.”[13]

The Trump administration should return to an initiative undertaken in its first iteration, when it had directed NIST to undertake a review of federal policies that could bolster the return of federal investments in R&D. The final 2018 report NIST produced, the “Return on Investment Initiative: Draft Green Paper,” concluded, “The use of march-in is typically regarded as a last resort, and has never been exercised since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.”[14] The report further noted, “NIH determined that that use of march-in to control drug prices was not within the scope and intent of the authority.”[15] The Trump administration should build upon the findings of the 2018 NIST Green Paper and affirmatively declare that price is not a legitimate basis for the exercise of Bayh-Dole march-in rights.

Do not give away American IP. The administration should also refrain from giving away private American IP to foreign or domestic entities. In the waning days of the Biden administration, the Nuclear Research Program at the Department of Energy misguidedly opened up U.S. clean energy technology to the world. The Nuclear Research Program actually mandated that any interventions supported by its funding be given away—even to foreign rivals.[16] The memo, which was not initially made public outside of the Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, stated:

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) is issuing this guidance regarding the commercialization of NE-funded technologies. With this guidance, NE is establishing a policy preference for the dedication to the public of such technology, where it is made freely available to the public with few or no intellectual property restrictions, or the non-exclusive licensing of technology developed with NE funding. (Emphasis added.)

Recognizing that the contractors who manage National Laboratories for DOE according to Management & Operating (M&O) contracts (DOE National Laboratory contractors) generally have rights under the Bayh-Dole Act, including the right to elect title to federally-funded inventions and license those inventions per the technology transfer mission clauses of M&O contracts this policy is intended to be a significant factor that the National Laboratory M&O contractors are expected to weigh when structuring and negotiating the licensing of NE-funded technologies, even when owned by the contractor. In the extraordinary circumstances in which a National Laboratory wants to exclusively license a NE funded technology, NE expects the National Laboratory M&O contractor to consult with NE leadership and the DOE Patent Counsel prior to entering into such an exclusive license. The purpose of this consultation is to verify that all parties agree that the exclusive license is the best vehicle for advancing DOE’s mission and interests, including maximizing commercialization and broadly disseminating NE-funded technology.[17]

Giving away U.S. nuclear technology is a poor strategy when China has already begun to surpass the United States in the research into and deployment of fourth-generation nuclear reactor technologies and to at least be close to, if not at par, with the United States in nuclear fusion.[18] The DOE should follow established technology licensing practices as codified in the Bayh-Dole Act.

(ii) How can the Federal government better support the translation of scientific discoveries from academia, national labs, and other research institutions into practical applications? Specifically, what changes to tech transfer policies, translational programs, or commercial incentives would accelerate the path from labs to market?

Empower the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) TIP Directorate. One of the most effective ways in which the U.S. government can catalyze technology transfer and commercialization would be by empowering a program it has already established. The National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnership (TIP) with the mission of accelerating key technology transfer to advance U.S. competitiveness. Congress authorized the directorate with $20 billion through the CHIPS and Science Act through 2027.[19] TIP makes industry buy-in a prerequisite for all projects receiving funding. Under Subtitle G of the CHIPS and Science Act, TIP grants must “develop mutually beneficial research and technology development partnerships and collaborations among entities such as institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, labor organizations, for-profit entities, government entities, and international entities,” a guideline meant to guarantee an accelerated path to practical commercialization and use, and a stark contrast from much of NSF’s other research.[20] Additionally, Subtitle G states that TIP grants are to be awarded only for research in several key technology focus areas, including AI, quantum computing, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.[21]

However, in the years since the CHIPS Act was passed, Congress has only appropriated $410 million to the program.[22] Unsurprisingly, a program with an intended budget of $20 billion can’t build U.S. competitiveness in critical technologies with just 10 percent of that budget. Yet, it has still made significant strides in accelerating technology translation. Rather than funding the ten technologies it originally chose, TIP has launched funding opportunities for three technologies viewed as having the greatest potential for growth in competitiveness with the smallest investment: AI use for protein and enzyme design, advancing cell-free systems in biochemical processes, and improving fifth-generation networks and creating next-generation wireless networks.

Given the success TIP has displayed in funding critical technology research and attracting private partners to research projects, Congress should extend the period over which the CHIPS Act authorizes TIP funding beyond 2027 to ensure that all $20 billion authorized is appropriated and appropriate $1 billion to the directorate for fiscal year 2026. Even with an additional $1 billion in appropriated funds from the CHIPS and Science Act, TIP would not be able to pursue funding opportunities across all 10 key technologies that Congress identified as critical to U.S. competitiveness. It would, at most, fund opportunities in a handful of technologies. An additional $1 billion should be added each fiscal year until annual appropriations for TIP reach or exceed $4 billion per year.

TIP is also operating with a 45 percent smaller workforce as of January 2025 as a result of departures from attrition, deferred resignation programs, early retirement offers, and other cuts made in compliance with directives from the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, compounded by the ongoing federal hiring freeze.[23] A smaller workforce, coupled with the hiring freeze, has made it impossible to expand TIP’s network of programs into critical technology areas. Congress must make it a priority to fund TIP fully and lift the hiring freeze for TIP.

Increase the importance of commercialization activities at federal labs and research institutes. America’s federal laboratories are insufficiently incentivized to invest time, energy, and resources in facilitating technology transfer, in large part because technology transfer is not even one of the eight main criteria in the Performance Evaluation and Management Plan (PEMP), a kind of annual report card for the federal labs.[24] Rather, PEMP treats successful transfers of technology to market as an afterthought. Elevating this important function to its own category would have significant impacts on the management of the labs and help to reverse the buildup of decades of skepticism and intransigence toward commercialization. Adding a ninth category to the PEMP for “Technology Impact” would create a mechanism to evaluate the economic impact of lab-developed technology, creating a stronger incentive for lab managers to focus on market implementation of valuable government IP assets and technical capabilities.[25]

Consider federal model IP agreements. Several states have implemented model intellectual property agreements, enabling faster, easier collaboration between universities and the private sector and streamlining the technology transfer process. Virginia, one of these states, announced its Lab-to-Launch initiative in August of this year, which will help university researchers and entrepreneurs in two key ways. First, the agreement standardizes the language in university IP agreements with start-ups, reducing the barriers and costs for entrepreneurs looking to commercialize their innovations. Start-ups that spin off from universities using these licenses are also eligible for awards of up to $50,000 toward their commercialization costs.[26]

Second, the bill creates an Entrepreneur-in-Residence program that connects university researchers with the private sector. This program will develop an online database of university IP, making it easier for private industry to find and engage with university researchers, reducing the cost and time required for collaboration.[27] The federal agreement should examine these model IP licensing agreements and evaluate if they could be helpful toward improving IP licensing practices, such as for IP coming out of national laboratories.

Expand DOE’s Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). LEEP is designed to help early-stage innovative energy entrepreneurs take their product ideas to market with the collaboration of laboratory staff. LEEP programs have been developed at several national laboratories, including the Cyclotron Road program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The LEEP program has enabled scientific entrepreneurs to develop critical energy-specific technologies that would have been cost-prohibitive without funding from national laboratories. One study found that LEEP achieved a 92 percent success rate, with nearly 4,000 jobs created, 182 new businesses started, and 212 fellows supported.[28]

Other government agencies should adopt the LEEP program, expanding this opportunity beyond simply clean energy technologies. The Department of War could undertake LEEP programs to support entrepreneurial scientists in defense and security technologies, or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) could develop a similar program for individuals with innovative ideas in life sciences or biotechnology.

Empower the NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) program. NSF’s Engineering Research Center program (ERC) supports a network of 17 strategic university-industry partnerships that pursue high-risk, high-payoff research across almost the entire spectrum of technology fields—including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, clean energy and sustainability, microelectronics, and information technology.[29] Since 1985, NSF has funded 83 ERCs that have led to more than 1,400 invention licenses, 920 patents, and 250 spinoff companies.[30] However, these partnerships do not require any industry funding match, reducing the likelihood that engineers trained in this program will be prepared with industry-specific skills or that research in these centers will be commercialized by private industry. Additionally, among the 17 ERCs currently funded by NSF, several are not focused on technologies used in globally traded industries, again reducing the applicability of the skills learned and the research conducted in these centers to the private sector.[31]

The administration should work to reform and expand this program. Given the goal of the ERC program to engage industry, it should be housed within the TIP directorate at NSF. Moving this program will also ensure that the ERC centers are aligned with the aforementioned 10 strategic key technology areas focused on by TIP.[32] Additionally, the framework for awarding funding under ERC should be adjusted. NSF should require that ERCs have at least half of their federal funding matched by industry. TIP should also ensure that existing and new ERCs more effectively coordinate with other similar federally funded programs. For example, NSF’s ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies should coordinate with the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing and Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), as both conduct research on cell manufacturing, but with a lower-level TRL focus for the ERC and a higher-level focus for NIIMBL. Beyond these reforms, the administration should work with Congress to ensure at least $150 million in annual funding for the NSF ERC program, supporting both existing and new manufacturing-focused ERCs.

Expand the Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRC) program. The Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program forges partnerships between universities and industry, featuring industrially relevant fundamental research, industrial support of and collaboration in research and education, and direct transfer of university-developed ideas, research results, and technology to U.S. industry to improve its competitive posture in global markets.[33] NSF currently operates IUCRCs in 10 different critical technologies, including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and information, communication, and computing.[34] As with the ERC program, the United States could get more out of the IUCRC program to support both the American scientific enterprise and U.S. industrial competitiveness. The IUCRC program should also be moved under the TIP directorate in NSF to ensure that IUCRC focus areas align with those designated by Congress as critical to U.S. competitiveness. Additionally, the Trump administration should work with Congress to provide annual funding for the IUCRC program that supports at least 15 more centers in critical commercial-ready technologies.

(iii) What policies would encourage the formation and scaling of regional innovation ecosystems that connect local businesses, universities, educational institutions, and the local workforce—particularly in areas where the Federal government has existing research assets like national laboratories or federally-funded research centers?

Expand the collaborative R&D Tax Credit. Growing sectors of the economy increasingly rely on collaborative research (e.g. research performed between a business and a university, federal lab, or consortium). Businesses are increasingly turning to universities, federal labs, and other external sources for research, allowing for the creation of top-ranked innovative commercial products. In response, U.S. allies and competitors are increasingly offering additional tax incentives to spur collaborative R&D. For example, Hungary offers a full expensing of all R&D costs conducted under collaboration with a university or research institution up to 500 million forints.[35] Japan offers a flat tax credit for collaborating with a university or research institution of up to 30 percent.[36]

Yet, the R&D tax credit—the principal way the government entices the private sector to invest more in R&D—falls short of effectively incentivizing research collaborations. To make the United States more competitive, Congress should create a collaborative R&D tax credit, eligible for all sectors. The United States currently provides a 20 percent credit for collaborative R&D, but it only applies to energy research. The administration should work with Congress to eliminate the energy restriction. Further, companies should be able to claim the R&D tax credit on 100 percent of the investments they make in R&D at U.S. universities; currently they’re only able to make a claim of up to 70 percent of their investment.

Reform Technology Hub Programs. In a 2019 report, “The Case for Growth Centers,” ITIF examined where innovation jobs are found in the U.S. economy, defining these as jobs in industries that have a specified level of R&D intensity and that employ a certain share of STEM workers. ITIF found that fully one-third of U.S. innovation jobs are concentrated in just 14 U.S. counties, and one-half in 40 counties.[37] This insight was part of the inspiration behind Congressional creation of the Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) Regional Tech Hubs program. EDA has designated 31 Tech Hubs and, in July 2024, released $504 million in Implementation awards for 12 of the 31 designated Tech Hubs.[38] The remaining 19 hubs should be fully funded.

Besides Congress not appropriating enough money, the program was poorly implemented. The Biden administration allowed NSF and the Department of Commerce (along with the Department of War and the Small Business Administration) to develop their own regional hub programs with no coordination, essentially spreading limited resources far too wide and thin. Moreover, many of the EDA awards are weak and likely to never become self-sufficient hubs once federal funding ends. Accordingly, the Trump administration should redo the competition, but this time fund fewer centers, make NSF and EDA develop a joint program, require industry investment, and ensure that winners could be self-sufficient.

(iv) How can federal policies strengthen the role played by small and medium-sized businesses as both drivers of innovation and as early adopters of emerging tech?

The Trump administration should work with Congress to get the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs reauthorized. The programs (enacted in 1982 and 1992, respectively) have grown to become the federal government’s most impactful programs and largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization, allowing U.S.-owned and operated small businesses to engage in R&D activity that has a strong potential for commercialization.[39] SBIR sets aside 3.25 percent of R&D funding from 11 federal agencies (all those with R&D budgets greater than $100 million annually), providing about $2.5 billion annually to support small businesses engaging in R&D with commercialization potential.

SBIR accounts for only 3 percent of federal extramural research funding, yet numerous studies have documented the program’s tremendous contributions to the U.S. innovation economy. Since the program’s inception, it has distributed over $40 billion in funding, which has contributed to the generation of over 70,000 patents and 700 public companies.[40] On average, SBIR-supported companies receive 10 patents each day—a testament to the innovative prowess of the more than 450,000 engineers and scientists working in companies that have been SBIR-supported.[41] Companies launched in part with SBIR support feature a “who’s who” of some of America’s most successful innovators, including 23andMe, Amgen, Apple, Biogen, Jarvik Heart, LIFT Labs, Millennium Pharma, Qualcomm, Symantec, iRobot, and countless others.[42]

Congressional policymakers failed to reauthorize the program before its expiration on September 30, 2025, leaving the future of large-scale small business and startup success in jeopardy. Congress should reauthorize the programs in new legislation while addressing some obvious issues, such as so-called SBIR mills, or companies that have become dependent on SBIR awards as a primary business model. For instance, Congress could cap the number of proposals any single small business may submit in response to any single Phase I or Phase II solicitation to no more than three proposals across the firm or limit businesses to no more than 25 proposals per year across all SBIR and STTR solicitations.[43] Congress could also cap the total award amount that a firm may receive from SBIR grants to $75 million.

Expand the use of innovation vouchers. The administration should consider working with Congress to expand the availability of innovation vouchers for small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Innovation vouchers are grants that enable SMEs to purchase services from universities, research institutions, or federal labs to stimulate innovation. These services may include assistance with conducting R&D, technology feasibility assessments, overcoming specific product development hurdles, product prototyping, lab validation, or other activities that are difficult for smaller businesses to undertake. Many innovation voucher programs have been adopted at the state level in the United States, including in Connecticut, New York, and New Mexico, as well as internationally in many European nations and Canada. In the United States, vouchers range from $25,000 to $50,000, while in Europe they range from €10,000 to €25,000.[44]

Innovation vouchers foster greater levels of the industry-academic collaboration necessary for knowledge transfer, while introducing SMEs to continuous R&D and innovation practices. As firms become more comfortable conducting R&D, the time required for product commercialization is reduced, inducing greater economic benefits.[45]

For the past several years, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have provided technical assistance to the recipients of Department of Energy (DOE) -funded voucher programs, namely American-Made Challenges (AMC), the Incubator Program, and the Small Business Vouchers Program. This effort should be fully built out into a national program across the clean energy focused federal labs to drive strong relationships between entrepreneurs and the national labs to accelerate the roll-out of new technologies in U.S. clean energy sectors such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries and solar cells.[46]

Expand the availability of Manufacturing Reinvestment Account. In Connecticut, small manufacturers receive a manufacturing reinvestment account, similar to a 401(k), where they may invest up to $100,000 of profits annually over five years. These accounts are 100 percent tax-exempt and may only be used for R&D-related expenses. Implementing these accounts on the federal level would allow small manufacturers to more easily afford R&D activities, with minimal cost to the government.[47]

(v) What empirically grounded findings from metascience research and progress studies could inform the federal grantmaking process to maximize ROI? Please provide specific examples of evidence-based reforms that could improve funding allocation, peer review, or grant evaluation.

A growing body of metascience studies can inform two key points of the federal grantmaking system: what and how it funds.

1. What the federal government funds:

(a) Longer, flexible, investigator-focused grants increase breakthrough output

Empirical evidence:

Azoulay et al. (2011) compare Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator awards—long-term, flexible grants that tolerate early failure—to NIH R01 awards, which are shorter, milestone-driven, and more risk averse. The study finds that HHMI investigators produce high-impact articles at significantly higher rates than comparable NIH-funded scientists.[48]

Potential reform:

Dedicate a defined share of NIH/NSF extramural budgets (e.g., 10-20 percent) to investigator-focused awards that offer longer terms, flexible budgets, and broader mission statements rather than narrow specific aims. This operationalizes the principle of funding people, not just projects, which empirical evidence suggests yields more transformative science.

2. How the federal government decides what to fund: Improving peer review

(a) Funding more highly novel projects

Empirical evidence:

A metascience review of existing studies found that standard peer review is biased against highly novel or interdisciplinary proposals, which are routinely penalized by reviewers, as reviewers discount ideas that are too unfamiliar or interdisciplinary (See: Tartari and Kolympiris, 2021; Ayoubi et al., 2021; Boudreau et al., 2016; Lane et al., 2021).[49]

Potential reform:

Create dedicated high-novelty tracks at NIH/NSF with panels explicitly instructed to reward novelty and be more tolerant of failure, evaluation frameworks that expect a mix of failures and successes, and a committed budget share for high-risk, high-reward proposals.

(b) Partial randomization to increase fairness when reviewer scores converge

Empirical evidence:

Research shows that in the mid-range, where many proposals are essentially indistinguishable in quality, reviewers are faced with the difficult task of selecting among these, which increases the risk of arbitrary decisions not based on scientific criteria that opens the door to biases. Partial randomization (lotteries) in this zone of proposals, complementing peer review, could provide an unbiased measure of fairness without harming scientific quality.[50]

Potential reform:

Implement tiered review in large NIH/NSF programs:

▪ Tier 1: Clearly outstanding, top rated, proposals—fund normally.

▪ Tier 2: All proposals above a quality threshold but not clearly rankable—enter into a lottery.

▪ Tier 3: Clearly noncompetitive—do not fund.

Start with pilots (e.g., small programs) and rigorously evaluate outcomes relative to traditional peer-reviewed programs.

(vi) What reforms will enable the American scientific enterprise to pursue more high-risk, high-reward research that could transform our scientific understanding and unlock new tech, while sustaining the incremental science essential for cumulative production of knowledge?

Create megafunds for high risk R&D. In 1960, private-sector R&D was split one-third to research and two-thirds to development. Today, only one-fifth of firm R&D goes to research. One reason companies are moving away from basic and applied research is because of the risk involved in financing. In drug development, for example, it often takes years or decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to produce a profitable product. Individual companies and even venture capitalists often lack the appetite for such long-term, high-risk, high-reward investments.

This risk could be mitigated through large portfolios that aggregate and manage risk. Mutual funds, pension funds, and 401(k) retirement accounts work this way, and MIT economist Andrew Lo has proposed extending this idea by establishing “megafunds” that utilize financial engineering techniques to fund R&D in long-term, high-risk, high-payoff areas such as drug discovery for cancer or orphan diseases.[51] However, to date, no such megafunds have been created by the market. The government incentives required for the creation of these funds could include one or more approaches from four broad categories: research and investment data streams; clear rules for private foundation program-related megafund investments; federal credit support; and tax incentives for funds investing in technologies with high societal impact (for example through the establishment of schedules and values of basis point step-ups and penalties).

To promote the creation of R&D megafunds, the Trump administration should establish an office within the Department of Commerce to develop and implement the needed incentives and oversight. The office would be tasked with establishing the rules for the funds and coordinating with federal agencies and the private sector to identify the technical areas of national interest where private-sector engagement is needed and the incentives required. The office should work with researchers, industry, and regulators to develop data-reporting and transparency standards that promote the translation of research to the market, provide a better understanding of the societal benefits of research, and an efficient data stream for regulation, and coordinate with federal funding agencies to enforce the provision and collection of such data.[52]

Continue to support the existing HRHR programs across government. Several government agencies have programs designed to fund HRHR research, which often have high costs but can yield high ROI. The NIH Common Fund includes an HRHR portfolio designed to invest solely in these more expensive investments, and the several ARPA offices in the DOE, Department of War, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Transportation have a similar purpose. The administration should refrain from cutting these programs as a short-term cost-saving measure and instead focus on the long-term returns they provide. The Trump administration should continue to empower these agencies to fund HRHR research.

(vii) How can the federal government support novel institutional models for research that complement traditional university structures and enable projects that require vast resources, interdisciplinary coordination, or an extended timeline?

The Financial Accountability in Research Model (FAIR). Under the current federal research funding mechanism for research institutions, institutions are paid for their research costs under two different categories: direct research costs, which include the cost of project materials, researchers, and payments to research participants, and indirect research costs, including the costs of utilities, leases, operations, and other facility expenses supporting research activities. Indirect costs are paid to the institution at a negotiated reimbursement rate that has not been adjusted in recent years and therefore does not account for the increase in regulatory and administrative costs for researchers. Thus, researchers are often reimbursed far below the true value of indirect research costs, placing an extra financial burden on research institutions.[53]

The Financial Accountability in Research (FAIR) Model improves on the current system by requiring all research institutions to classify all costs for each project they undertake as research performance costs (formerly direct costs) and essential research performance support and general research operations (formerly indirect costs). These changes increase the transparency for the government by outlining exactly what services are being funded, and ensures that research institutions are funded for their complete research costs, rather than just a small fraction. The administration should work with Congress to implement the FAIR Model for all agencies that award grant funding.[54]

Focused Research Organizations (FROs). Traditional academic structures excel at investigator-driven discovery but struggle with projects that require large-scale coordination, extended timelines, or shared research infrastructure. Novel institutional models could fill this gap. The federal government can support Focused Research Organizations (FROs)—non-profit entities designed to tackle large, complex research challenges and produce public goods (tools, datasets, platforms) and fall outside the scope of a single academic lab, company, or informal consortium.[55]

Historical examples include the Large Hadron Collider and the Human Genome Project—efforts too large and too uncertain for individual labs or early-stage companies, not immediately lucrative enough for industry to undertake, yet essential for scientific progress.[56]

In biopharma, FROs could tackle pre-competitive challenges too big for one company. One current example, supported by Convergent Research, an incubator for FROs, aims to map the pharmome—identifying all unintended targets of approved small-molecule drugs.[57] The public benefits include better safety pharmacology profiling, new drug repurposing opportunities, and better training data for AI drug development models.

NSF’s initiative, Tech Labs, announced December 12, 2025 to launch and scale a new generation of transformative independent research organizations to advance breakthrough science is an important step in this direction.[58] Most federal science funding takes the form of small, project-based grants to individual scientists at universities, but a more diversified funding portfolio, with initiatives such as Tech Labs (with $10-50 million/year awards per team, 5+ year commitments, and measuring impact through advancement up the Tech Readiness Level scale rather than papers published) is key as research today is increasingly team-based, interdisciplinary, and infrastructure-intensive, needing institutional support, and cannot be done only through the traditional funding model of a series of grant projects.

(viii) How can the Federal government leverage and prepare for advances in AI systems that may transform scientific research—including automated hypothesis generation, experimental design, literature synthesis, and autonomous experimentation? What infrastructure investments, organizational models, and workforce development strategies are needed to realize these capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor and research integrity?

One of the most effective ways the federal government can prepare for AI-driven advances in scientific research is by ensuring that emerging automation capabilities are translated into widely usable research infrastructure. A key priority should be supporting the adoption of self-driving labs (SDLs), which use AI and robotics to autonomously design, execute, and interpret experiments. SDLs directly increase scientific productivity by replacing slow, manual trial-and-error workflows with automated experimental loops. This is especially important in materials science, where progress remains rate-limited by the need to fabricate and test large numbers of physical samples because material behavior cannot be reliably predicted in advance. By automating experimentation and continuously feeding results back into models, SDLs allow researchers to explore larger design spaces more quickly while generating standardized, reproducible data.

While promising SDL systems already exist, ensuring their broad adoption as routine research infrastructure will require sustained public support. Materials science, in particular, has seen slower diffusion than related fields such as chemistry, where automated synthesis and high-throughput experimentation are more established. This reflects the long timelines from discovery to deployment in materials, which reduce private incentives to invest in capital-intensive automation despite large long-term returns. Targeted public funding can ensure these capabilities scale.

Policymakers should ensure broad adoption by pursuing public funding models that de-risk early deployment and make self-driving labs accessible beyond a small number of well-resourced institutions. One approach is an ARPA-E–style Grand Challenge that competitively funds teams to build and demonstrate SDLs capable of delivering measurable advances in materials discovery. This would accelerate technical progress while establishing proof points for SDLs as durable national infrastructure. In parallel, policymakers should support Focused Research Organizations to develop modular, open-source hardware and software components that lower costs, enable interoperability, and make SDLs easier to replicate and adapt across labs. Together, these models would move SDLs from isolated demonstrations into widely usable research infrastructure.

(ix) What specific federal statutes, regulations, or policies create unnecessary barriers to scientific research or the deployment of research outcomes? Please describe the barrier, its impact on scientific progress, and potential remedies that would preserve legitimate policy objectives while enabling innovation?

Develop a Phase Zero grant award program within major federal research agencies. When the SBIR and STTR programs were still active, they both supported innovation, but required high approval standards for early-stage companies. There was often insufficient funding available at universities (or from other sources) to advance nascent technologies to the point at which these companies were positioned to receive an SBIR or STTR grant. The problem was that researchers and universities lacked the resources to support the proof-of-concept work, market analysis, and mentoring needed to translate ideas and nascent technologies from the university laboratory into a commercial product.

A national “Phase Zero” proof-of-concept program would not only help more projects cross the “valley of death,” but would also help enhance the infrastructure (e.g., expertise, personnel, support, small business, and venture capital engagement) and facilitate the cultural change necessary for universities, federal laboratories, and other non-profit research organizations to support commercialization activities.

America’s competitors have recognized the need for such an instrument. For instance, the European Research Council (ERC) has announced a new proof-of-concept funding initiative to help bridge the gap between ERC-funded research and the earliest stage of marketable innovations.[59] These awards can be as high as $215,000 for individual researchers, in total, equivalent to about 1 percent of ERC’s budget.[60] Here in the United States, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation has established Translational Research (for individual researchers) and Translational Partnership (for institutions) Awards for proof-of-concept research in biomedical engineering.[61] The Translational Research Awards are made in amounts of approximately $100,000 per year, while the university grants have a duration of five years at over $500,000 per year.

Similarly, NIH’s Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) program fosters the development of therapeutics, preventatives, diagnostics, devices, and tools that address diseases within NIH’s mission in a manner consistent with business case development. The work supported by the REACH program may include technical validation, market research, clarification of IP position and strategy, and investigation of commercial or business opportunities.[62] Finally, a number of states, such as Kentucky and Louisiana, have developed Phase Zero grants to help firms apply for SBIR grants and support early proof-of-concept research. One way for the federal government to implement such a proof-of-concept program would be through a grant program for states that agree to match the funds dollar-for-dollar.

(x) How can Federal programs better identify and develop scientific talent across the country, particularly leveraging digital tools and distributed research models to engage researchers outside traditional academic centers?

If the United States is to significantly revitalize America’s scientific enterprise, it needs to take further steps to ensure it has the workforce to support expanded U.S. scientific and technical output. That’s especially the case as analysts expect the demand for tech talent to grow to 7.1 million tech jobs by 2034 in the United States, from an estimated six million in 2023.[63] Another report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) finds that, by the end of 2030, an estimated 3.85 million additional jobs requiring proficiency in technical fields will be created in the United States, but that, “Of those, 1.4 million jobs risk going unfilled unless we can expand the pipeline for such workers in fields such as skilled technicians, engineering, and computer science.”[64] For the semiconductor industry, the report estimates that roughly 67,000—or 58 percent of projected new jobs (and 80 percent of projected new technical jobs)—risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates.[65] The administration should lead in several efforts to enhance U.S. workforce skilling, including:

Expand Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program funding. Skilled technicians are a key component of the traded sector workforce. One highly successful program designed to build technician skills is NSF’s Advanced Technological Education program, which supports community colleges working in partnership with industry, economic development agencies, workforce investment boards, and secondary and other higher education institutions.[66] ATE projects and centers are educating technicians in a range of fields, including nanotechnologies and microtechnologies, rapid prototyping, biomanufacturing, logistics, and alternative fuel automobiles. Notwithstanding this, ATE funding is quite small, at approximately $74 million in FY 2025.[67] The Trump administration should work with Congress to double ATE funding to at least $150 million per year.

Expand the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP). The engineering curricula at too many American universities is overly academic as opposed to industry focused. Indeed, university engineering programs have evolved in two troubling directions over the past several decades. First, the focus on “engineering as a science” has increasingly moved university engineering education away from a focus on real problem solving toward more abstract engineering science. Second, this focus on “engineering as a science” has left university engineering departments more concerned with producing pure knowledge than working with industry to help them solve real problems.

That’s why ITIF has argued that the United States needs more “manufacturing universities,” which would revamp their engineering programs and focus much more on manufacturing engineering and in particular work that is more relevant to industry. This would include more joint industry-university research projects, more student training that incorporates manufacturing experiences through co-ops or other programs, and a Ph.D. education program focused on turning out more engineering graduates who work in industry. These universities would view Ph.D.s as akin to high-level apprenticeships (as they often are in Germany), where industry experience is required as part of the degree. Likewise, criteria for faculty tenure would consider professors’ work with and/or in industry as much as their number of scholarly publications. In addition, these universities’ business schools would integrate closely with engineering and focus on manufacturing issues, including management of production.

One model for these manufacturing universities is the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, which reimagined engineering education and curriculum to prepare students “to become exemplary engineering innovators who recognize needs, design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world.”[68]

Congress implemented a form of these proposals when it passed the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program into law in December 2016 as part of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing the Department of Defense to support industry-relevant, manufacturing-focused, engineering training at U.S. institutions of higher education, universities, industry, and not-for-profit institutions. With its $48 million in initial funding, MEEP made awards to 13 educational and industry partners to bring educational opportunities to Americans interested in learning manufacturing skills critical to sustaining the U.S. defense innovation base.[69] In 2023, MEEP issued additional three-year funding grants “that establish programs or enhance existing programs to better position the manufacturing workforce to produce military systems and components that assure technological superiority for DoD.”[70]

MEEP can be a powerful initiative, but it is underfunded and has become too solely focused on engineering in the national defense context. Therefore, the Administration should work with Congress to broaden the MEEP remit to refocus it more on supporting industry-relevant, applied engineering programs at leading universities. Congress should allocate $150 million annually to a revitalized MEEP program that would make grants to 20 engineering programs at leading U.S. universities to redirect them toward more hands-on, industrially relevant engineering activities.

(xi) How can the fed government foster closer collaboration among scientists, engineers, and skilled technical workers, and better integrate training pathways, recognizing that breakthrough research often requires deep collaboration between theoretical and applied expertise?

Establish an Office of Innovation Review. Because federal agencies often propose regulations with little consideration given to their effect on innovation, Congress should task the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs with creating an Office of Innovation Review (OIR) to review proposed regulations to determine their effect not just on costs in the short term but also on innovation over the long term. OIR would have the specific mission of being the “innovation champion” within agency rule-making processes.[71] It would have authority to push agencies to either affirmatively promote innovation or to achieve a particular regulatory objective in a manner least damaging to innovation. OIR would be authorized to propose new agency actions and to respond to existing ones and could incorporate a “competitiveness screen” in its review of federal regulations that affect globally traded industries.[72]

(xii) What policy mechanisms would ensure that the benefits of federally-funded research, including access to resulting tech, economic opportunities, and improved quality of life, reach all Americans?

Withdraw the NIH Intramural Research Program Access Planning Policy. On January 10, 2025, in one of the Biden administration’s final actions, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued an Intramural Research Program (IRP) Access Planning Policy whose objective was to “expand equitable patient access to products that emerge from NIH-owned patents.”[73] The directive required “organizations applying to NIH for certain commercial patent licenses to submit Access Plans to NIH outlining steps they intend to take to promote patient access to those licensed products.”[74] Pricing was a central focus of the Access Planning Policy, the guidance noting that ways applicants could “promote equitable access and affordability in product deployment” could include by “Committing to keep prices in the U.S. equal to those in other developed countries” or by “Committing to price reductions once preset sales, revenue, or profit thresholds are reached.”[75]

But bringing a drug to market represents a complex, risky, lengthy, and costly process that can take 14 or more years at costs measured in the billions of dollars. The notion that a small start-up licensing prospective IP in the form of a novel chemical compound from a university is in any kind of position to reliably price a potentially resulting product over a decade and hundreds of millions, if not billions, in further development and clinical trials costs is simply not realistic. (And the same goes for many products beyond drugs.) Requiring licensees to accurately predict years in advance how a product resulting from a licensed IP would be priced would stifle U.S. biopharmaceutical innovation. Therefore, the Trump administration should direct the NIH to withdraw its Intramural Research Program Access Planning Policy and also ensure that similar requirements aren’t promulgated across other federal agencies.[76]

The advancement of transformative scientific breakthroughs requires more than robust R&D funding—it also depends on a comprehensive policy framework that supports both innovation and timely deployment.

Innovative U.S. companies have pioneered the breakthrough technology of multi-cancer early detection (MCED), developing diagnostic tests that can reliably screen for the presence of more than 50 types of cancer from a simple blood draw. MCED is poised to transform the world’s cancer screening paradigm—which is vitally important when one in two women, and one in three men, are likely to develop cancer at some point in their lifetimes.[77] Unfortunately, the United States has lagged in crafting a policy environment supporting MCED adoption and encouraging innovation.

Current Medicare statutes create the most significant barrier to deployment of breakthrough medical technologies by requiring explicit congressional authorization for each new category of preventive screening, regardless of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval status. For MCED technologies this statutory gap prevents Medicare beneficiaries from accessing FDA-approved tests despite their transformative potential. The barrier’s impact extends beyond patient access: it weakens incentives for continued private-sector investment in high-risk medical research and risks ceding American leadership in precision medicine to foreign competitors, namely China.[78]

The United States simply can’t afford to squander its lead in MCED by allowing regulatory roadblocks to remain in the way of the industry’s further development. The bipartisan Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act (H.R. 842/S.339) offers a practical remedy by establishing an evidence-based pathway for coverage of FDA-approved breakthrough technologies while preserving CMS’s authority to determine appropriate coverage parameters. These reforms are consistent with the approach taken by Congress with colonoscopy screening—which ultimately paved the way for tremendous progress America has achieved in the screening of colon cancers. Importantly they would maintain rigorous safety and efficacy standards while eliminating arbitrary delays that currently separate regulatory approval from patient access, thereby strengthening the entire innovation ecosystem from basic research through clinical deployment.

(xiii) How can the federal gov strengthen research security to protect sensitive technologies and dual-use research while minimizing compliance burdens on researchers?

Create tiered risk categorizations for technologies. In practice, the current system for research security often relies on broad, compliance-heavy requirements that are not consistently tiered to the actual sensitivity of the research or the threat environment. The federal government does not use a single, unified definition of “sensitive technology” or “dual-use”; instead, it operationalizes sensitivity through multiple, partially overlapping regimes. The current model defines these categories primarily through export-control lists (the Export Administration Regulation’s Commerce Control List and the International Traffic in Arms’s U.S. Munitions List) and a few domain-specific oversight regimes (e.g., the U.S. Government Policy for Oversight of Dual-use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential in the life sciences). However, these mechanisms are anchored mainly to known items, agents, or reasonably foreseeable misuse pathways, rather than systematically tiering basic research areas by how they might become dual-use over time; this can leave emerging risks underappreciated, and some disciplines may not view themselves as part of the research/security problem set.

The centralization of risks through tiered categorization is needed precisely because of the political economy in scientific communities and research organizations/universities. There is little incentive to self-assess that basic research, far away from practical dual-use applications, can build rival countries’ capacities. Yet, this happens in practice. For example, basic research on how bacteria defend themselves from viruses helped enable CRISPR gene editing, which is now widely treated as biosecurity-relevant because it can lower barriers to modifying organisms, including potentially harmful ones; likewise, open computer-vision and machine-learning research has been incorporated into military intelligence/surveillance and targeting support.

Develop security assessment guidelines. Research scrutiny is heavily focused on projects that receive federal funding, but most R&D is driven by private investment. Although screening and organizational risk assessments for defense contractors generally work as intended, they tend to overlook private R&D in areas with capabilities that could be used for dual purposes but are currently business-oriented. For example, robotics for household use or software-heavy R&D.

A simple solution to this problem would be to introduce security assessment guidelines for companies applying for the widely used R&D tax incentive. In other words, to qualify for tax benefits for private R&D, applicants should meet a basic set of security standards, such as those established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Homeland Security.

Assemble the interagency research security working group. The interagency research security working group was established under the National Science and Technology Council and authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 to enforce the continued implementation of NSPM-33, which instituted requirements for disclosure and research security infrastructure for research recipients. OSTP should regularly convene the interagency research security working group to ensure that NSPM-33 continues to be implemented across all government agencies and that security measures are coordinated and harmonized across government.

Another potentially effective research security model would borrow from cybersecurity concepts to shift away from today’s largely binary, front-loaded approach to vetting researchers and move toward a more robust endpoint security and zero-trust architecture model. Currently, universities assess research security risk most heavily at the hiring stage, which requires high amounts of compliance and often results in a go/no-go decision that either blocks talent entirely or assumes low risks thereafter.

A zero-trust–inspired framework could instead allow broader participation while segmenting access based on risk and sensitivity, asking explicitly what data, tools, or research outputs a university is comfortable exposing if compromised. This means continuous checks throughout the research lifecycle, including in the laboratory, collaborations, access, and offboarding, rather than concentrating compliance on individual disclosures. Such an approach would reduce friction for researchers and might increase overall compliance resources, but would better shift that responsibility to universities without choking off openness or talent.

Conclusion

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation commends the Trump administration for working to reform and accelerate the American scientific enterprise. The success of this effort will be vital to enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. science and technology over the coming decade.

Economic fragmentation is driving countries to prioritize national security and resilience. Heavy industries, such as manufacturing and data centers, require dispatchable, reliable energy sources that operate 24/7. These demands are reshaping energy both domestically and abroad.

The U.S. is uniquely positioned to adapt to these changes. Its geographical advantages, including resource-rich neighbors like Canada and access to low-cost labor in the south, create a strong North American economic bloc. Combined with abundant natural resources, such as a vast supply of natural gas, the U.S. has the foundation for reindustrialization and energy independence.

In contrast, Europe faces several significant energy vulnerabilities. The continent’s lack of natural resources and reliance on imports make it susceptible to energy shocks. While renewables advance environmental goals, they cannot meet the demands of heavy industries, accelerating Europe’s deindustrialization.

Meanwhile, China pursues an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy, investing in coal, nuclear, and renewables, while forging ties with resource-rich nations. However, inefficiencies in its state-controlled system, coupled with politically motivated policies, and the health of its domestic economy without a US consumption partner to trade with raise concerns about the long-term sustainability and efficiency of its energy approach.

America’s market-driven energy system offers a structural advantage over state-controlled models. Efficient resource allocation and abundant natural gas provide a reliable bridge fuel for heavy industry. At the same time, strong infrastructure supports growth despite fiscal challenges, and the U.S. is better equipped to handle the energy demands of heavy industry. To maintain this edge, U.S. policy must focus on reliability and affordability. The demand for dense, reliable energy transcends political divides. To drive reindustrialization, the U.S. must prioritize natural gas and nuclear energy as central components of its energy strategy. While renewables like solar and wind can play a complementary role, they cannot replace firm baseload power required for heavy industry. Reviving nuclear is critical to deliver 24/7, high-capacity energy.

As the world shifts to a multipolar economic system, technologies like AI are unlocking vast opportunities. By securing reliable energy, strengthening supply chains, and committing to long-term investments, the U.S. can solidify its global leadership. Businesses and investors who grasp these dynamics may be well-positioned to thrive in this new era of global competition.",https://www.williamblair.com/-/media/williamblairwebsite/feature/insights/2025/eqr_close-up-earth-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:40.939026

“Clean energy adoption in Massachusetts is a movement hiding in plain sight.” Local homeowners Nicole Barna and Dudley Wyman are among the growing number of Bay Staters opting into clean energy.
“Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters are already using clean energy in their lives in some way,” Pappas said.
“This report shows that millions of Americans are moving forward to reduce the impact of their energy use on the environment”, said Massachusetts State Representative Steven Owens.","Boston – Environmental advocates gathered at a home powered by clean energy in Cambridge on Wednesday, to highlight a recent report showing that hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters have incorporated clean energy technologies into their lives. The report, Clean Energy Across America, by Environment Massachusetts Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group, provides tips and policy recommendations to help more Americans adopt clean energy, even as federal tax credits phase out.

“From Cape Cod to the Berkshires, Bay Staters have invested their own time and money to install solar panels on their roofs, put EVs in their driveways, or buy clean energy from their utilities,” said Joseph Pappas, Campaign Associate with Environment Massachusetts Research & Policy Center. “Clean energy adoption in Massachusetts is a movement hiding in plain sight.”

Local homeowners Nicole Barna and Dudley Wyman are among the growing number of Bay Staters opting into clean energy. Barna and Wyman live in a “passive home” powered by an array of solar panels. Their home features efficient electric heat pumps to heat and cool their home, chargers to power their electric vehicles, and other energy efficiency features.

“On an annual basis, our solar array has produced more electricity than we have consumed”, said Nicole Barna. “This energy surplus has come back to us in the form of rebates, ensuring a win/win for our wallet and the environment.”

To help more Americans reduce energy waste and switch to renewables, the report offers resources, including guides for home winterization and how to go solar, and tips for buying a used EV.

“Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters are already using clean energy in their lives in some way,” Pappas said. “Common-sense steps can make it easier and more affordable for Americans to adopt clean energy.”

One way Massachusetts can help more residents adopt renewable energy is to encourage or require local jurisdictions to use “smart permitting” online platforms for residential solar and energy storage systems. These platforms, used in many states across the country, make it faster, easier and cheaper for residents who want to put solar on their roofs, or batteries in their garage or basement, to do so.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2025/12/69447067dc81c6.26060837.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:22.131440

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th judicial district against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

The goal is to fund programs that will find and remove lead service lines that deliver drinking water to communities.

As part of its process, the EPA collected updated lead service line data and released a new dashboard that shows the latest data on lead service lines in the United States. The data for this dashboard comes from the EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR), which required, among other things, that public water systems provide a service line inventory to their primary state agency by October 16, 2024.

The LCRR submissions required that service lines be categorized as follows: lead service lines or pipes made from lead; galvanized pipes requiring replacement or pipes made from galvanized steel; non-lead service lines, and water service lines made with unknown materials. Note: Galvanized pipes requiring replacement under the guidelines were treated as lead service lines, as lead can adhere to galvanized steel lines.

The EPA further estimates that there are four million total lead service lines in the United States. This figure comes from the updated 2025 7th Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment (DWINSA) and includes both active known lead service lines and anticipated lead service lines. Accordingly, funding will be based on the latest information about these approximately four million lead service lines.

An additional $1.1 billion from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) will also be allocated to this lead service line replacement initiative. These funds can be used for “lead service line replacement (LSLR) and associated activities like identification, planning, design, and replacement.”

The DWSRF was established as part of the1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act to help achieve various objectives related to providing safe and clean drinking water in the United States. From its implementation to 2019, more than $41.1 billion in funds have been provided to states.

According to Reuters, Ford Motor is taking a $19.5 billion write-down and is removing several electric-vehicle (EV) models from its line-up, as the auto industry retreats from battery-powered models in response to weakened EV demand and the Trump administration’s policies. GM and Stellantis have already shifted more of their production to combustion engine vehicles, also taking financial hits. GM wrote down $1.6 billion in EV assets and indicated that more write-downs are expected. Due to the push for electric vehicles by Western governments, automakers overestimated their demand and are now making a detour to correct the costly error.

Sales of new electric vehicles in the United States, especially more expensive models, have slowed since the beginning of 2024. The Trump administration rolled back financial incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by removing tax credits at the end of the fiscal year, further depressing sales. The administration is also modifying automobile efficiency standards from those approved by the Biden administration to eliminate the requirement forcing EV purchases.

Companies Will Continue with EV Production at a Reduced Level

According to Reuters, Ford will switch production at a new factory in Tennessee to gas-powered pickup truck models from electric models, cancel an electric commercial van model, remake the F-150 Lightning vehicle into a hybrid from a pure electric vehicle; and convert its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and data centers that train artificial intelligence. It is also planning to build a medium electric truck with a $30,000 price target by 2027 to be competitive with Chinese automakers. That was the first in a line of low-cost electric vehicles. CBS News reports that, by 2030, Ford expects about half its global volume to consist of hybrids, extended-range vehicles, and electric vehicles, up from 17% this year. Hybrids are believed to be more affordable and practical to consumers who are wary of pure electric vehicles due to their high sticker prices, worries over battery range, and access to charging stations.

Western vehicle makers are aware of the competitive threat posed by Chinese EV automakers, whose models are popular at home and abroad. U.S. automakers see Americans want smaller, affordable EV models like those made by Chinese automakers and sold outside the United States. Currently, Chinese vehicles are banned from U.S. markets because of tariffs. Ford’s changes are expected to put it on a better footing to compete with Chinese automakers.

Besides the $19.5 billion write-down Ford is taking, its EV losses since 2023 have totaled $13 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, making its total EV junket at least a $32.5 billion mistake. American automobile buyers were charged more for their gas and diesel vehicle purchases to help pay for the misguidance of automakers producing electric vehicles, with overall vehicle prices hitting new heights. Many Americans felt vehicles were becoming unaffordable.

Via Electrek, GM is halting production of its electric vehicles due to slower EV industry growth and customer demand. Production of the Cadillac Lyriq and larger Vistiq, both of which are built at a Spring Hill, Tennessee facility, will be reduced during the first five months of 2026. GM plans to suspend one of its two shifts at the facility, resulting in layoffs for workers on the second shift. GM is also delaying the start of a second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant outside of Kansas City “indefinitely,” where the new Chevy Bolt EV was scheduled to enter production this year. GM also plans to slow production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit.

Automakers Turn to Producing Energy Storage Batteries

According to the Wall Street Journal, automakers and battery manufacturers are repurposing electric-vehicle battery plants to serve the fast-growing data-center and utility markets, as slowing EV demand pushes companies to seek alternative revenue streams. General Motors, South Korean conglomerate LG, and Chrysler parent Stellantis have shifted toward producing batteries for energy-storage systems to help offset the downturn in electric-vehicle sales.

Tesla has already built a sizable business in the segment, generating billions of dollars in sales from energy-storage batteries. Revenue from its energy-generation and storage division, which also includes solar panels, rose 67% last year to $4 billion, partially cushioning a $6 billion decline in EV revenue.

GM is also exploring a partnership to supply energy-storage batteries to Redwood Materials, a battery-recycling startup. Under the proposed arrangement, GM would provide Redwood with a mix of new and used batteries for large-scale storage projects. Meanwhile, a Chinese-owned battery manufacturer that had planned to supply Mercedes-Benz is now considering pivoting to energy-storage products in an effort to revive a stalled factory project in Kentucky.

U.S. electricity demand is growing again due to demand from artificial intelligence data centers, manufacturing, and increased electrification, which was pushed by the Biden administration and continues to be pushed in blue states. These factors make energy storage a growing business.

Europe Waters Down Its Ban on New Gas-Powered Vehicles

As reported by the BBC, the European Union has watered down its ban on new gas-powered vehicles, easing rules approved two years ago that required all new vehicles sold from 2035 onward to have zero carbon emissions, which would have effectively barred the sale of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional internal combustion engines. Instead, it is using a strict emissions cap that leaves room for gas and hybrid models. Instead of a 100% tailpipe carbon dioxide reduction target in 2035, it has a 90% fleet reduction. The change still forces automakers to sell mostly zero-emission vehicles, but it opens a path for a small number of plug-in hybrids and highly efficient combustion cars, particularly those that can run on certified carbon dioxide-neutral e-fuels or advanced biofuels.

Analysis

The so-called EV revolution is beginning to stall as automakers repurpose their EV production capacity in favor of gas-powered vehicles and batteries for energy storage. Slowing EV sales and the removal of subsidies and mandates by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have signaled to these manufacturers that their efforts are better served by meeting consumer demand rather than government incentives. Even in Europe, politicians are starting to realize that forcing automakers to sell only EVs would raise prices and force consumers to drive cars that can’t travel as far.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bigstock-Vilnius-Lithuania-July-459514845.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:02:10.624909

These wins didn’t happen on their own. They happened where governors, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental organizations and community partners fought for cleaner air and lower bills – and where utilities were held accountable for delivering modern, reliable, cost-effective solutions. Here are some of Environmental Defense Fund and our partners’ most meaningful victories from the past year:

A Year of Big Wins for Clean, Affordable Power in the States Share on X

Illinois curbed rate hikes and expanded access to clean, affordable electricity

Illinois regulators cut gas utilities’ proposed rate increases in half, trimmed the utilities’ profit rates, and rejected renewable natural gas proposals that would have raised costs without providing environmental value. EDF and Illinois PIRG were involved for months, urging regulators to require cleaner, cheaper alternatives – and the decision sends a clear message that utilities must modernize and offer cleaner, more affordable alternatives rather than double down on yesterday’s gas infrastructure.

Illinois regulators also unlocked more than $250 million for an electrified clean energy future: EV charging, fleet electrification, small business support and customer benefits. When the Illinois Attorney General challenged the Commission’s authority to approve these programs, EDF and partners intervened and won on all contested issues, protecting this progress.

EDF secured a landmark agreement with a utility to add new and expanded transmission lines – one of the most powerful tools for keeping electricity clean and affordable ­– and deploy grid-enhancing technologies to boost the performance of existing lines. These advanced hardware and software tools can cut the time and cost of connecting renewable energy to the grid. The agreement is expected to create up to 32,000 jobs, support power for 1.8 million homes, and deliver long-term savings for customers across the Midwest and beyond.

In Illinois, a new electricity rate called Rate BEST helps Commonwealth Edison customers save money using more renewable energy by shifting electricity use to times of day when power tends to be more affordable and cleaner. Since 2015, EDF and the Citizens Utility Board have championed time-of-use rates in Illinois, working with ComEd to design, pilot, and bring Rate BEST to customers in the new year.

New York advanced heat pump affordability and modern grid planning

EDF and partners secured an agreement with Con Edison to expand access to simpler, fairer electric rates designed for heat pumps – helping households cut heating bills and realize the full benefits of clean, efficient heating. These types of rates can save an average customer around $500 per year in energy costs. The utility will also expand outreach and education programs to help customers understand their options.

At the same time, the New York Public Service Commission advanced 29 critical electric grid upgrades to support electric vehicle (EV) charging and building electrification, then adopted a proactive planning framework that speeds interconnection of new loads while cutting costs. EDF’s recommendations helped drive these reforms.

Texas advanced EV charging and smarter grid planning

Texas also saw meaningful progress in 2025. EDF secured commitments from the utility CenterPoint to improve EV forecasting and modernize distribution system planning – essential steps for cost-effective electrification in one of the country’s fastest-growing EV markets. CenterPoint also committed to bolster its efforts to support the Port of Houston’s ongoing electrification, a move that will cut pollution and improve public health in surrounding communities.

Massachusetts helped customers reduce energy bills with clean heat

Massachusetts utilities – Unitil, National Grid, and Eversource – cut winter electricity rates for homes using heat pumps, saving these households about $540 on average this winter, a 17% reduction in heating bills. Adopted by the Department of Public Utilities, the rates fix long-standing inequities in how heat pump customers are charged. EDF intervened in National Grid’s rate case to secure the heat pump rate for all heat pump homes and a tiered discount rate of 32-71% for income qualifying households regardless of whether their home has a heat pump.

Looking ahead to 2026, EDF and partners are pushing for deeper seasonal delivery-charge discounts to better align winter electric heating costs with natural gas. New analysis commissioned by EDF shows that fairer rate design could enable more than 80% of Massachusetts homes to save an average of $687 in a single season – unlocking even greater benefits from clean electric heating and providing a model for other states.

In addition, Massachusetts began implementing landmark siting and permitting reforms adopted by the state legislature in late 2024. These reforms streamline and speed up the deployment of clean energy infrastructure, while helping ensure robust community engagement and careful consideration of project impacts. This year, the state released draft guidance and proposed regulations on site suitability assessments, cumulative impacts, and related issues. EDF has actively engaged at every stage of this process and remains committed to supporting the successful implementation of these critical reforms.

New Jersey protected customers and stopped costly hydrogen blending experiments

New Jersey regulators rejected a utility proposal to make customers pay for unproductive experiments blending hydrogen and biomethane – rebranded as “renewable natural gas” –into the gas system. EDF helped negotiate a settlement that scales back Public Service Electric & Gas’ (PSE&G) planned infrastructure spending, protecting households from unnecessary costs and keeping the state focused on cleaner, proven, and more affordable solutions. EDF also commissioned a study showing that PSE&G’s proposed hydrogen blending is far less efficient than helping customers electrify home heating with heat pumps.

A year of progress despite Washington’s attempts to reverse course

In a year when the Trump administration focused on undermining climate progress and helped drive up electricity costs, states showed what real leadership looks like. They cut unjustified rate hikes, rejected wasteful gas spending, required utilities to invest in modernizing the grid, expanded clean energy and secured fairer, more affordable electric rates for millions of families.

The message from 2025 is clear: a cleaner, more affordable, and fairer electricity system is possible, and EDF is committed to helping states deliver on this promise for everyone.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//couplelookingatbills.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:59:01.224977

The lawsuit concerns an executive order issued by President Donald Trump following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July that removed a safe harbor clause specifically for solar and wind projects. Safe harbor lets projects eligible for tax credits still qualify for the subsidies if they complete an established percentage of the project before a deadline.

Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, wants to see more money collected from efforts to stop Chinese “seafood dumping” go directly to Louisiana seafood producers.

“Dumping” is a market tactic in which a country sells food products at prices lower than the cost of producing them, which can drive U.S. producers out of business, Cassidy’s office said in a news release. The U.S. collects “dumping duties” on food that comes from countries that employ the tactic.

In 2000, Congress passed a law that required Customs and Border Protection to give the money collected from those duties to American farmers and others who are affected by dumping, the release says. But due to various delays, much of that money has not been paid out — and has gathered significant interest.

Cassidy and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have introduced a bill that would require CBP to pay $38.5 million in accrued interest to the U.S. agricultural sector, including $10.6 million for crawfish producers.

Disclosure: The Southern Environmental Law Center is a VPM sponsor.","The State Corporation Commission suspended its approval of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center — a planned Dominion Energy Virginia natural gas plant that has drawn significant opposition from Central Virginia residents and environmental groups.

Regulators said in a short filing Tuesday that the suspension will allow them more time to consider an appeal filed on Monday by Appalachian Voices, the NAACP and Mothers Out Front. Those groups opposed the plant and are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center.

Their appeal petition argued that the SCC failed to consider emissions impacts on fenceline communities as required under the state's environmental justice law, instead leaving that to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.

The EJ law defines a fenceline community as ""an area that contains all or part of a low-income community or community of color and that presents an increased health risk to its residents due to its proximity to a major source of pollution.""

The commission's Nov. 25 final order said CERC would have smaller local health impacts than the coal plant that operated on the same property from 1952 until 2023.

The appeal challenged that conclusion: ""With all due respect, that methodology countermands the fundamental goals of the VEJA; it would encourage constructing new fossil fuel infrastructure at locations that have historically housed such infrastructure, ensuring those communities continue to experience harms.""

Environmental advocates also argued that Dominion must meet energy efficiency targets under state law in order to build new fossil fuel power plants — targets that the utility has not met. That requirement can be superseded if there is a demonstrated need for more electricity production to avoid reliability issues; regulators said in their November order that need does exist.

That's another issue raised by the appeal: how the threat to reliability was determined. Appellants argued that Dominion provided ""minimal evidence"" of its claim that CERC is necessary to prevent rolling blackouts, brownouts, or other consequences.

The SCC cited modelling and statements from Dominion, PJM Interconnection (which operates the regional electric grid capacity market) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation in deciding that additional generation is needed by 2029.

The state commission's acceptance of the appeal isn't necessarily a sign that regulators agree with its arguments, nor that the SCC will change its November decision in approving the plant. SELC attorney Grayson Holmes said he appreciated their willingness to take a closer look.

""We hope the Commission will recognize that permitting Dominion to claim this narrow exception on flimsy evidence sets a bad precedent—effectively suggesting that any future gas proposals could easily clear this hurdle, even if they are not the cleanest or most economic option,"" Holmes said in a press release.

Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said in a statement that CERC is ""an important part of Virginia's all of the above strategy to ensure our region has the reliable power we need.""

""We stand behind the SCC's approval of the project,"" Slayton wrote Thursday. ""It was approved after a year of exhaustive review, an extensive public hearing and participation by thousands of Virginians.""

A new analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund highlights premium cost increases in 13 states where Republican senators could face accountability from voters, are retiring, or may otherwise be persuadable.

After months of congressional Republican obstruction, a discharge petition will force the House to vote in January on a clean, three-year extension of the ACA’s enhanced tax credits. This vote creates a clear path forward to preserving affordability. But preventing massive premium increases ultimately depends on whether the Senate acts to protect families from higher health insurance costs.

“Republican senators no longer get to hide behind House gridlock, it appears,” said Natasha Murphy, director of Health Policy at CAP Action and co-author of the analysis. “The path to stopping premium spikes in 2026 is clear, and the question now is whether Senate Republicans will step up for families or allow costs to skyrocket.”

The analysis finds that, without action, Americans could see significant increases in their health care premium costs, including:

Anchorage, Alaska: A family of four earning $161,000 would pay $25,300 more annually.

Portland, Maine: A single parent earning $85,000 would pay $12,700 more annually.

The idea behind it was simple: provide cash incentives for homeowners in low-income and environmental justice zones to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.
The state, using money from the Renewable Energy Fund, would give incentives to a vendor to provide solar panels, leases and power-purchase agreements to qualifying homeowners.

Last month PosiGen filed for bankruptcy, and it’s not clear what will happen to the Rhode Islanders who signed contracts in the solar program.","PROVIDENCE — The program was supposed to put solar panels on roofs and help Rhode Island’s low-income families with their electric bills. Instead, it left homeowners dealing with a bankrupt company and nowhere to turn for help.

Nearly two years ago, Gov. Dan McKee announced the Affordable Solar Access Pathways (ASAP) program. The idea behind it was simple: provide cash incentives for homeowners in low-income and environmental justice zones to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.

The state, using money from the Renewable Energy Fund, would give incentives to a vendor to provide solar panels, leases and power-purchase agreements to qualifying homeowners. Leases would be signed for 25 years. The state would also provide energy efficiency measures and a home energy audit to the homeowners, at no cost to them, as part of the program.

The idea behind the initiative was to spur solar panel adoption among low-income homeowners and lower their energy costs. Areas of Woonsocket, Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, Cranston, West Warwick, East Providence, Warren, Middletown, and Newport would be eligible to apply.

The only other requirement for households was to have a roof in good condition and have an income at or below 80% of the state median. There was no credit score required, and homeowners in default electric service could apply. The program, as designed, was guaranteed to provide savings for homeowners in the first year.

“Low-to-moderate income communities have been historically underserved in the solar marketplace and often experience the negative impacts of climate change firsthand,” McKee said in a January 2024 press release announcing the launch of the program. “Providing environmental justice communities with affordable access to rooftop solar is essential to ensure all Rhode Islanders benefit from the renewable energy transition.”

The state hired PosiGen, a Saint Rose, La.-based company, to administer the program, which was similar to the service PosiGen provided, except the state would subsidize a big chunk of the leases for enrollees in the program.

PosiGen ultimately owned the solar panels and the leases, and households in the program were actually paying back the company, not the state. That’s how its business model worked: the company installed the solar panels at no cost, recouping costs entirely via the lease payments.

The $1 million in incentives from the Renewable Energy Fund would provide between 200 and 300 homes with solar panels, according to the program launch’s press release.

By August 2024, 116 households had signed contracts with PosiGen, with the state estimating the first year of energy savings to be $830 in electrical costs. The effective price of the energy was 13 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the program metrics recorded by the state Office of Energy Resources (OER) — the last resort service rates last winter and this winter were 16.39 cents and 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour respectively.

The program was, by all measures, succeeding. It was putting solar panels on the roofs of low-income homeowners in environmental justice zones — areas determined by the state to suffer adverse environmental and public health consequences usually caused by pollution — and lowering their winter electricity costs. But developments with PosiGen in recent months have put the program, and its enrollees, in uncertain waters.

Last month PosiGen filed for bankruptcy, and it’s not clear what will happen to the Rhode Islanders who signed contracts in the solar program. State officials aren’t saying much.

“It’s too soon to determine,” said Matthew Touchette, director of communications for the state Executive Office of Commerce. Touchette declined to provide ecoRI News with a copy of the PosiGen contract, saying a request for the document must go through open records request procedures.

Beadle said both state agencies are committed to offering a low-income solar program, but had not made a decision on either finding a new vendor or pursuing a different program. The existing program still has one thing left: money. Touchette told ecoRI News the ASAP program still had most of its funding; $842,199 was left when the program was paused.

On Aug. 24, PosiGen laid off nearly its entire staff. The company at that point had furnished solar power for some 40,000 residential customers across 15 states.

Solar Power World, a solar industry trade publication, reported that thanks to the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” clawing back tax credits related to renewable energy, the company had failed to make interest payments on some of its debt, and the company’s investors declined to put more money into the company.

With not enough cash left in the bank to cover its operating expenses, PosiGen moved to lay off most of its staff instead, many of whom were caught unaware. OER and Rhode Island Commerce paused applications for the ASAP program shortly after, and have yet to find a new vendor to run the program.

On the state’s ASAP webpage, consumers are told to contact the company: “If you are a current ASAP participant with questions about your project or billing, please contact PosiGen customer service at 888-939-4442.”

The company remained in something of a holding pattern until last month. Reuters reported the company filed for Chapter 11 protections in Texas in November, and the company has been working its way through bankruptcy court. The company has $206 million in funded debt and its primary lender, Brookfield Asset Management, wants to foreclose on its assets and transfer the customers to a new solar power provider.

Part of PosiGen’s problems was its core business model. PosiGen provided solar panels at no cost to the consumer, instead of recouping expenses through the 25-year leases, as well as selling tax credits and the revenue from the leases to investors.

The second coming of the Trump administration was an existential crisis for PosiGen and the larger renewable energy industry in the United States. Trump’s hostility to renewables has been well documented. And when Congress passed the “Big Beautiful Bill” this past summer, it sunset or slashed dozens of tax credits used by the industry, which has as a result sharply reduced its expectations for expansion in the coming years.

In an increasingly divided country, Environment America’s longstanding focus on bringing people together to protect the natural world led to relationships with new and sometimes unconventional allies — and to results that every American can benefit from.

“America has the greatest outdoors on the planet. If there’s one thing that gave me hope in 2025, it was seeing people who share that belief come together across the nation and political spectrum to take action,” said Environment America’s Executive Director Lisa Frank. “Americans worked shoulder to shoulder to protect public lands, invest in wildlife crossings and clean up our waterways. Our resolution for 2026 is to continue working with everyone who values the natural places and species that make this country special, as we near its 250th birthday.”

Environment America and its state groups celebrated the following highlights and milestones in 2025:

Safeguarding America’s treasured natural spaces

This summer, when Congress mulled over a proposal to sell off up to 1.2 million acres of public lands, we joined with a broad, bipartisan movement of ranchers, hunters, hikers, climbers and conservationists to successfully convince lawmakers to withdraw the plan.

In Georgia, we worked with our supporters and allies to build public opposition to a mining project just three miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The large number of opponents eventually helped conservation allies purchase the land so that no one can mine there. The proposed project would have involved digging for titanium dioxide, a chemical the EU has determined isn’t safe in food, yet U.S. companies use as a whitener in cookies, toothpaste, salad dressing and other things. Thankfully, Georgians across the political spectrum thought it was more important to preserve this unique place of natural beauty than to have more of an unnecessary food additive.

We continued working in Minnesota to urge decision makers to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness from proposed copper sulfide mining that could leak acidic drainage and toxic metals into the region’s many interconnected lakes and streams. Our staff and volunteers educated the public and built support for stronger protections for this beloved wilderness.

Additionally, alongside our allies, partners and members, we submitted more than 600,000 comments opposing opening millions of acres of our last wild national forests to large-scale, industrial and commercial logging. Across 45 million acres and 37 states, these special forest places are home to countless animals and are essential to the way of life of hunters, anglers, hikers and others who cherish the access they provide to America’s great outdoors.

Bipartisan momentum behind wildlife crossings

Every year, vehicle collisions kill between 1 and 2 million large animals and put countless drivers at risk. Wildlife crossings can dramatically reduce these collisions while reconnecting fragmented landscapes. Environment America’s state and national staff have been actively supporting and promoting the construction of these crossings, including in California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Washington and Oregon.

We worked to shore up support for state and federal legislation and programs that will invest in these important infrastructure projects. This includes urging Congress to reauthorize the Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program, which would provide funding for crossing projects across the nation.

We also cultivated a broad coalition to advance the Wildlife Movement through Partnerships Act. This bipartisan effort included nearly one hundred groups and businesses such as sportsman’s clubs, rod and gun clubs, outfitters and guide services. The proposed legislation would direct agencies to coordinate research, action and funding that would allow for new wildlife corridors and effective crossing projects where they are needed most.

Meanwhile, our canvassing operations engaged thousands of people by knocking on their doors, successfully building public awareness about how wildlife crossings and corridors mitigate collisions, save lives and restore habitat connectivity.

Finally, in Idaho, Environment America and its partners reached an agreement with the mining company P4 Production to fund improvements to a critical mule deer migration corridor near Soda Springs. The Soda Hills mule deer herd follows ancient seasonal routes now threatened by fences, highways and development. The project will help restore those pathways so deer can safely move between their summer and winter ranges.

Tackling plastic pollution through citizen science, state laws

This spring, Environment America Research & Policy Center and its partners organized the first International Plastic Pellet Count, a global citizen science effort to track “nurdles,” the tiny pellets used as raw material for plastic products.

More than 1,100 volunteers collected 49,256 pellets across 200 sites in 14 countries and 29 U.S. states, showing just how widespread this pellet pollution has become.

The participants not only cleaned up thousands of pellets, but also helped provide crucial data to build public awareness and momentum for rules and policies to curb plastic pellet pollution at the source.

In Oregon, we played a crucial role in launching an ambitious producer responsibility law for packaging and paper products. The state’s Recycling Modernization Act gives more Oregonians access to curbside recycling, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, producers of packaging and paper products will now share the costs of improving the recycling system.

We also supported Washington state’s Recycling Reform Act, which will expand curbside recycling to hundreds of thousands of additional homes, require companies to help pay for the waste their packaging creates and simplify recycling rules with a uniform statewide list. We supported similar laws in other states including Colorado, California, Minnesota and Maryland.

Landmark court victories: making polluters pay

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court denied ExxonMobil Corporation’s petition asking the justices to take up an appeal of the company’s record-setting loss in a Clean Air Act enforcement suit. Environment Texas, the National Environmental Law Center and Sierra Club filed that suit in 2010.

The suit cited repeated violations at the company’s Baytown, Texas, oil refinery and chemical plant complex. It resulted in a $14.25 million civil penalty against Exxon — the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in a citizen-initiated public interest lawsuit to enforce the Clean Air Act.

Then, in September, our partners at PennEnvironment, alongside Three Rivers Waterkeeper, reached a major settlement with Styropek USA after documenting nurdles from its facility washing into the nearby Raccoon Creek and Ohio River system. Pellets were found on the water’s surface, in sediment and even caught in shoreline vegetation downstream of Styropek’s plastic facility.

Under the agreement, Styropek will pay $2.6 million in penalties and must completely redesign its stormwater collection and treatment systems to capture all of its pellet waste. The company will also install real-time monitoring at every outfall, with automatic penalties if even a single pellet escapes.

One mission: protecting the natural world

Looking back on these highlights from 2025, we’re proud of what we, our partners across the political spectrum and members have achieved. In 2026, we look forward to building on these accomplishments, and more, in service of our sole mission: to protect the natural world.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_AME.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:00:14.454401

The researchers used data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to see if the benefits of federal environmental regulations, such as the estimated number of asthma attacks prevented by air pollution regulations, outweigh the costs to comply with and enforce environmental protection rules. The team found that the benefits — calculated by looking at medical costs and financial losses from missed work, decreasing premature deaths and reducing the prevalence of diseases like lung and bladder cancer and cardiovascular issues — are up to five and six times higher than the costs associated with implementing the rules.

In the following Q&A, study co-author Onur Apul, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State, discussed the societal impacts of environmental protection

Q: What do you mean when you say “environmental protection”?

Apul: The U.S. EPA protects human health and the environment by developing and enforcing regulations based on environmental laws passed by Congress. In addition, EPA conducts scientific research, sets national standards for air, water and soil quality, and works with states to address local pollution issues and minimize environmental risks.

Q: How have environmental regulations impacted public health and the economy over the past 50 years?

Apul: The message of our article is very simple: Environmental protection is good for public health and the American economy. Protecting our environment is not an expense, it's cost-saving. It’s like conserving energy in your house: It may look expensive at first — you have to install nice windows, maybe insulated heat exchangers — but in the long term you're going to be saving energy and saving money.

In our article, we went to the EPA’s databases and extracted how much it costs, for example, to remediate arsenic from drinking water versus implementing and enforcing a federal-level rule regulating arsenic in drinking water. Then we looked at EPA benefit computations, like how much does it cost to lose a young person from the workforce because of a sickness? We did a summary of all major EPA environmental rules and concluded that environmental protection is a cost-savings. In some cases, it's five times; in some cases, 10 times more beneficial than the costs associated with implementing and enforcing the regulations.

For example, the Clean Air Act is predicted to prevent 100 million asthma attacks by 2050. What's the average cost or benefit of not having an asthma attack? This corresponds to about 200,000 fatalities prevented. Or look at the Lead and Copper Rule, which regulates lead and copper in drinking water and prevents almost 1 million infants per year from having low birth weight.

Q: You noted that for the past 20 years, about 24 new chemicals have been registered every minute. How many chemicals does the EPA regulate?

Apul: Think about how many chemicals you use daily. Think about the paints, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter painkillers people use each day. The American Chemical Society Chemical Abstract Service lists about 275 million chemicals. That means 24 new chemicals have been registered every minute over the past 20 years, but the EPA regulates fewer than 100 contaminants out of 275 million. Advancing science, advancing engineering, increases life expectancy and environmental protection is one of those advancements, improving our quality of life by preventing child deaths, unexpected disease-related deaths and pollution-related deaths.

Q: How much does it cost to run the EPA?

Apul: The EPA’s operating budget is tiny compared to the total federal budget and the country’s GDP. The EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2024 was about $10 billion, or less than 0.15% of total government spending. That’s 0.03% of U.S. GDP. And in 2024 the EPA employed only about 15,000 people who regulate all these compounds, contribute to research, contribute to policy making, engage with communities and direct messaging. This small number of people, working on a small budget compared to total government spending and the nation’s GDP, help to protect the environment, preserve natural resources and save lives.

The French automaker could introduce a successor to the C1 that echoes the iconic 2CV’s character while looking completely different, according to Autocar reports. This would position Citroen among Europe’s most affordable electric options.

Consumers have been pushing for genuinely affordable electric vehicles for years without much success in Western markets. Battery packs remain the priciest component despite steady cost reductions over recent years. Most Western-market EVs start above $30,000, excluding many buyers seeking economical transportation options.

Chinese manufacturers produce models under $15,000 for their domestic market, but trade restrictions and certification requirements block their entry into American and European markets. This affordability gap outside China frustrates consumers wanting to abandon fossil fuels without exceeding their budgets.

Britain’s Dacia Spring retails for around $18,750, establishing the current European baseline for electric affordability. BYD’s Dolphin Surf starts at $23,300, several thousand dollars more expensive than the new Citroen. The French automaker’s potential model might price lower than both options if the proposed regulations pass. The new classification aims to reduce the financial burden of manufacturing small, inexpensive vehicles by easing certain compliance standards.

Brussels is weighing this framework after manufacturers complained that current rules make entry-level production economically impossible. The category would relax requirements these vehicles must satisfy.

Similar to the United States, Europe finds building genuinely inexpensive cars increasingly difficult under existing mandates and regulations. This proposal seeks to revive affordability across the segment. Its ultimate direction remains unclear.

Implementation would probably involve compromising some protection standards and oversight measures that ostensibly serve valid purposes. Citroen’s chief executive Xavier Chardon endorsed the potential ruleset during recent statements. He suggested approval would probably allow the French automaker to re-enter the smallest vehicle category it previously exited due to economic pressures.

Delivering a sub-$20,000 EV in Western countries demands several advances beyond regulatory adjustments alone. Battery expenses must keep declining while production efficiency rises substantially.

Western manufacturers need to implement cost-cutting manufacturing methods without quality sacrifice. Volume becomes essential as increased output reduces individual unit expenses significantly. Tax credits could fill remaining price differences, though recent policy shifts eliminated numerous purchase incentives that previously improved affordability for buyers. Material breakthroughs might decrease reliance on costly parts and components.

Simplified configurations with reduced amenities could lower prices, though buyers might reject bare-bones products missing features they consider standard equipment. The obstacle isn’t purely engineering but also consumer expectations, since Western purchasers may anticipate comforts that Chinese buyers willingly forgo for lower costs.

For entities like Ferrari N.V. (NYSE: RACE) that focus on the luxury segment of the auto industry, concerns about affordability aren’t as strong, since the buyers they target only need to be convinced about the quality and exclusivity of the new electric models made as an alternative to the gasoline versions they have relied on for decades.

The U.S. Department of Commerce will seek feedback from stakeholders between January 1, 2026 and 11:59 p.m. ET on January 14, 2026 on including new auto parts and components within the scope of sectoral tariffs, according to a notice published this week.

Business and industry stakeholders that testified during a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) public hearing on December 3-5, 2025, urged caution against destroying the benefits of the agreement while noting there is room for improvement. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is expected to provide a report to Congress regarding its USMCA position by early January, in preparation for ongoing negotiations ahead of the July 1, 2026 deadline to conclude the review.

In a statement on the USTR review of the USMCA, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) urged the administration to “preserve the core structure of the USMCA while pursuing targeted refinements, adequate transition periods, and measures that further incentivize North American supply chain resilience.”

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) stated the “U.S. should preserve and strengthen the USMCA during the agreement’s six-year review,” but seek targeted revisions in areas that include reducing red tape at the border, promoting greater use of USMCA preferences, addressing unfair competition, and working with North American partners on “regional economic security issues instead of levying Section 232 tariffs.”

In recent remarks to The Wall Street Journal and POLITICO, USTR Jamieson Greer suggested the USMCA could be split into separate deals, and commented that withdrawal from the USMCA is “always a scenario.” Greer also stated, “The president’s view is he only wants deals that are a good deal. The reason why we built a review period into USMCA was in case we needed to revise it, review it or exit it.” According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, “any party can invoke USMCA Article 34.6 and exit the agreement with six months’ notice, regardless of the review process.”

The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) predicts 2025 U.S. new light-vehicle sales will “finish the year at 16 million-plus units, given the strong sales performance earlier this year.”

Mexico approved a proposal to impose tariffs of 5% to 50% on more than 1,400 products from China and other nations with which it does not have a free trade agreement.

Shipments across the U.S. – Mexico border could be delayed due to blockades in certain areas that have been coordinated toprotest robberies and assaults on cargo drivers. TRADLINX, a supply chain visibility platform based in Seoul, stated, “For cross-border logistics teams, this is not a one-day headline; it’s an ongoing risk factor for planning U.S.–Mexico freight through the end of the year and into 2026.”

MARKET TRENDS AND REGULATORY

U.S. new light-vehicle inventory was estimated at 3.01 million units at the start of December 2025, or a 90 days’ supply industrywide, compared to 2.97 million units at the beginning of November 2025. Inventory across individual brands varied significantly: Lexus and Toyota had the lowest days’ supply, at 44 and 45, respectively, while the highest inventory exceeded a 140 days’ supply for Audi, Jeep, Chrysler, and Lincoln.

Kelley Blue Book data indicates new vehicle average transaction price (ATP) rose 1.3% year-over-year to $49,814 in November, and the average new vehicle manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) has been above $50,000 since April 2025. The average incentive package in November was 6.7% of ATP, compared to 7.9% of ATP in the same period last year. The analysis also noted that new vehicle prices reflect “a market heavily influenced by affluent households.”

Commentary from Edmunds excerpted in CNNand CNBC suggested that certain new-vehicle consumers may “still face a challenging marketplace” despite the Federal Reserve’s December 10 decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. Edmunds estimates the average monthly payment for a new vehicle reached $772 in November 2025, while the average amount financed was close to an all-time high of $44,000.

A report in Automotive News assessed whether vehicle total cost of ownership could increase if automakers deprioritize fuel-saving technologies in response to the Trump administration’s revisions to Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.

The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly planning to delay enforcement of 2027-2032 vehicle pollution rules. The Biden-era standards would require a 50% reduction in certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxides through 2032 for light vehicles, and a 58% reduction for medium-duty vehicles.

A significant portion of vehicles recalled across all reasons – including serious flaws – do not get repaired, according to analysis of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data by The Wall Street Journal.

Car and truck rental company Enterprise Mobility acquired St. Louis-based Hogan for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to support Enterprise Mobility’s entry into the Class 7 and Class 8 heavy-duty truck market.

The European Commission released a proposal to require a 90% reduction of carbon-dioxide tailpipe emissions from baseline levels for new cars sold in the bloc beginning in 2035. The remaining 10% of emissions will have to be offset by sustainable fuels or low-carbon steel made in Europe. The proposal revises a previous target that would have required 100% CO2 emissions reductions for new passenger vehicles sold in the EU by 2035.

In remarks submitted for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged lawmakers to address the competitive threat posed by Chinese manufacturers, and stated, “No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent from happening inside the U.S.”

China’s vehicle exports in the first eleven months of 2025 reached 6.3 million units globally, up 18.7% year-over-year.

Paccar units Kenworth Truck and Peterbilt Motors launched new battery-electric tractor and truck models.

The CEO of ChargePoint Holdings indicated that more than 40 states have solicited or signed contracts to build new EV charging stations in recent weeks, located in rural and underserved areas, and “other places where they might not have otherwise made economic sense.” The activity was attributed to the Department of Transportation’s revised guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program issued in August 2025.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over allegations the federal government is blocking congressionally approved funds intended to establish EV charging infrastructure. The funding was established through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program (CFI) and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. A group of environmental organizations filed a separate suit accusing the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration of unlawfully withholding funding for the CFI program.

As of late 2025, the U.S. was estimated to have over 81,000 EV charging stations with more than 250,000 individual charging ports nationwide. This represents a 17% increase compared to the start of 2025.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, ""we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill's co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure ""gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win'' on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,"" Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy ... expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.""

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,"" said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,"" he said.

“Across the country, a patchwork of state regulations has resulted in unverified claims like ‘recyclable,’ ‘compostable,’ and ‘reusable’ to appear on packaging, often without any connection to real-world recycling or composting systems,” Weber’s office said in a statement. “This confusion has made it harder for consumers to know what can actually be recycled and has weakened legitimate environmental initiatives.”

The PACK Act aims to address this problem by promoting science-backed, industry-driven standards for environmental labeling. Under the legislation, companies may only make environmental claims if those claims are scientifically verified and recognized by existing recycling or composting programs, ensuring “honesty and transparency” without imposing new mandates.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Weber said. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

Industry leaders have praised the legislation’s approach.

“AMERIPEN applauds Rep. Randy Weber for introducing the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act and supports the PACK Act’s creation of a federal framework for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims for consumer packaging under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),” said Lynn Dyer, President of AMERIPEN. “This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging. AMERIPEN will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.”

“The Plastics Industry Association thanks Congressman Weber for introducing the PACK Act,” said Matt Seaholm, PLASTICS President and CEO. “Plastic packaging is essential to modern life—protecting products, keeping food fresh, and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely—yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims. This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.

""The PACK Act would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines. As an industry that employs more than one million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber’s leadership on this important issue that strengthens U.S. manufacturing and consumer confidence.”

“We welcome the introduction of the PACK Act for creating a single, national framework for packaging claims,” said Peter DePasquale, Vice President, Government Affairs, Keurig Dr Pepper. “By setting clear, national standards and certifications through credible third parties, this legislation helps ensure consumers receive accurate information while giving companies the consistency they need to innovate and accelerate investment in sustainable packaging solutions nationwide.""",https://www.packagingstrategies.com/ext/resources/2025/12/us-capitol-hill-closeup-washington-dc-900x550.jpg?height=635&t=1766088737&width=1200,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:11.824629

New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania are suing the Trump administration over funding for electric vehicle chargers, as part of a coalition of 17 Democratic attorneys general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. They are alleging the White House is acting unlawfully by withholding funds approved by Congress.

“Without any notice or explanation, the United States Department of Transportation just quietly refused to approve any new funding under the programs which had already been appropriated by Congress and awarded to the states,” said New Jersey Attorney General Michael Platkin.

“This is consistent with how this administration has treated congressional appropriations. They’re not optional. They’re laws,” said Platkin. And the Constitution says that only under limited circumstances can the president, after money has been appropriated by Congress and passed into law, can he restrict those funds from going to their intended recipients.”

New Jersey is waiting on $16 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. Both programs are part of the Biden-era bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Congress passed in 2022.

Platkin said the funds would create new jobs and provide EV drivers greater access to the roads.

“At a time, again, when we’re trying to make energy costs go down,” Platkin said. “We’re trying to make people’s lives easier and more affordable. This makes no sense. It’s illegal, but it also just makes no sense.”

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s actions violate the Constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement that the funds would support “EV construction projects in Pennsylvania and … new, good paying jobs.”

“I will not let the federal government break their word at the expense of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said.

Pennsylvania was awarded funds to construct three charging stations along I-78 and I-81. The joint project involving Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia was awarded $18.6 million.

The effort was part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to tackle climate change.

This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the effort. “While the Administration is busy finding ways for their Big Oil donors to profit, California will continue to fight for its people, environment, and innovation.”

The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment.

But President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’s not a fan of electric vehicles. Trump signed a law that ended EV tax credits and recently weakened fuel efficiency standards, saying that Americans prefer gas-powered vehicles.

Given these challenges, Rhode Island must adjust its climate planning efforts to reflect the new federal landscape.","PROVIDENCE, RI – Today the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4), chaired by Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) Director Terry Gray, approved the 2025 Climate Action Strategy. The Strategy is intended to guide implementation of the Act on Climate and provides a comprehensive assessment of Rhode Island’s emissions trajectory, programmatic tools, and the feasibility of achieving statutory greenhouse gas reduction mandates under current conditions. Developed in collaboration with the Office of Energy Resources (OER) including significant public input, the strategy outlines a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45% below 1990 levels by 2030.

“The Climate Action Strategy is the result of hard work by all the EC4 agencies and, in particular, the climate teams at OER and DEM. Over the last 14 months they have worked very closely with the experts at Energy, Environment, and Economics, Inc. (E3) who provided contract support and modeling. Throughout the process, we have engaged with many different communities to get meaningful input and feedback,” said DEM Director and EC4 Chair Terry Gray. “This strategy reflects a clear-eyed assessment of today’s landscape and the challenges ahead. Rhode Island was moving in the right direction under the Act, but our efforts are clearly impeded by considerable federal policy changes.”

“The EC4’s approval of this strategy charts a path forward for making progress towards the Act on Climate while recognizing new, significant challenges from the Trump administration,” said OER Acting Energy Commissioner Christopher Kearns. “The core of our climate work is increasing the share of zero-emission energy resources while maintaining electricity affordability for households. Supporting rate stability is a key foundation for meeting our emissions reduction goals, alongside continued investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, heat pumps, pre-weatherization, and energy-efficiency programs that are essential to sustaining progress.”

Since the Act on Climate was signed in 2021, new programs, laws, and regulations have supported the state’s emissions-reduction goals. RI has been a leader in offshore wind development and modeling showed that fully carrying out these initiatives as originally planned would’ve put the state on track achieve the 2030 reduction targets.

Recent federal actions – including tariffs, the rescission of Clean Air Act authorities supporting clean vehicles, the termination of Inflation Reduction Act clean-energy and electric-vehicle tax credits, efforts to stall offshore wind development, and the elimination of programs such as Solar for All – have significantly altered the landscape on which Rhode Island’s climate strategy was built. The updated strategy recognizes that these changes will have immediate and serious consequences for the state’s climate plans. Given these challenges, Rhode Island must adjust its climate planning efforts to reflect the new federal landscape.

A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects and limiting judicial review.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews total hundreds of pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Huffman and other Democrats also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that are being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, ""we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill's co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that ""America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.

Support for the measure ""gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win'' on permitting reform, Golden said.

Ford is also shelving planned electric commercial vans and repositioning its production lines to prioritize trucks, vans, and hybrid vehicles.
One report projected that U.S. energy storage deployments will reach record levels this year amid surging interest.
The move also underscores widening divergence between the EV market and energy storage.
Energy storage markets are competitive, with established players such as Tesla already commanding significant shares of the grid-scale battery business.","Ford Motor Co. is taking a nearly US$20-billion hit on its electric-vehicle investments and redirecting capital toward hybrids and energy storage as U.S. EV demand falters, even though global EV sales remain strong. The strategic overhaul includes cancelling several EV models, expanding hybrid and extended-range vehicles, and repurposing EV battery plants for grid and data-centre storage applications.

Ford framed the move as a “decisive redeployment of capital” in a Monday announcement that accompanies its 2026 business plans, as part of its broader Ford+ strategy. The company plans to redirect investment away from larger EVs that have struggled to meet sales and profitability expectations, and toward products and technologies where it sees stronger near-term returns.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities,” Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said in a company press release outlining the new strategy. That includes expanding its lineup of hybrid and extended-range vehicles, as well as a new battery energy storage systems (BESS) business, which Ford said will use existing battery production capacity in the U.S.

Major write-down underscores EV market headwinds

Ford’s nearly US$19.5 billion impairment charge — one of the largest in recent corporate history — reflects the cancellation of planned EV models, the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korean partner SK On, and other program-related write-downs. About $8.5 billion of the charge relates to scrapped EV projects, including large pickups and vans, while roughly $6 billion reflects the end of the SK On venture and $5 billion covers other program expenses.

Reuters reporting notes that Ford is discontinuing the fully electric F-150 Lightning and its next-generation sibling, the T3, in favour of an extended-range hybrid model that incorporates a gasoline engine to recharge the battery. Ford is also shelving planned electric commercial vans and repositioning its production lines to prioritize trucks, vans, and hybrid vehicles.

The retrenchment comes as U.S. EV sales have faltered — in part due to federal policy changes that ended consumer tax credits and relaxed emissions regulations — and overall EV market penetration has remained lower than earlier projections. According to Reuters, EVs now account for roughly 10 per cent of new vehicle sales in the U.S., compared with about 25 per cent globally.

Battery plants repurposed for grid and data-centre storage

One of the most notable aspects of Ford’s pivot is its intention to repurpose existing EV battery manufacturing capacity to produce large-scale energy storage systems. At its Glendale, Kentucky battery plant — originally built for EV battery production — Ford plans to invest roughly US$2 billion over the next two years to build lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and assemble them into 20-foot energy storage containers with at least 5 megawatt-hours (MWh) of capacity each. The company aims to produce at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

The storage units are intended for grid operators, utilities and data centres, where demand for reliable power buffering and peak shaving is growing rapidly. Analysts say that as data centres and other large energy users seek to manage peak demand and integrate more renewable generation, the market for grid-connected battery systems is expanding quickly. One report projected that U.S. energy storage deployments will reach record levels this year amid surging interest.

In reporting by Canary Media, industry watchers say Ford’s strategy reflects broader trends in the energy transition. “They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at Raymond James, told reporters. “While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Broader industry and market dynamics

Ford’s shift comes amid a broader reevaluation of EV strategies across legacy automakers. General Motors has also taken impairment charges related to EV production, while Stellantis has scaled back some EV plans in favour of hybrid platforms. Reuters coverage notes that many traditional carmakers — constrained by higher development costs, weakening demand and shifting regulatory environments — are returning to hybrid and traditional powertrain investments.

Analysts also point to weakening consumer incentives as a factor. The U.S. federal EV tax credit, once worth up to US$7,500 per vehicle, expired this year following legislative changes, removing a key subsidy that helped boost EV demand earlier in the decade. At the same time, average gasoline prices in the U.S. have fallen below US$3 per gallon in recent months, making conventional vehicles more attractive to cost-conscious buyers.

Strategic reset and future prospects

Ford’s revised approach prioritizes profitability and flexibility. The company says it expects its global mix of hybrids, extended range vehicles and EVs to reach roughly 50 per cent of total volume by 2030, up from about 17 per cent today, suggesting hybrids will play a major role alongside any future EV offerings.

The move also underscores widening divergence between the EV market and energy storage. Where EV sales have slowed, grid storage demand — particularly for data centres and utility applications — remains robust, driven by efforts to stabilise electricity systems and integrate renewables.

Yet Ford’s transition is not without risks. Energy storage markets are competitive, with established players such as Tesla already commanding significant shares of the grid-scale battery business. Whether Ford can carve out a meaningful position in storage while recalibrating its vehicle lineup remains to be seen.

For now, the Detroit automaker is betting that redeploying capital from struggling EV programs into hybrids, extended-range vehicles and energy storage will position it for more sustainable, profitable growth in a shifting automotive and energy landscape.",https://energi.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EV-Big-Guan-Getty-Images.webp,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:51.983478

Here are three reasons why I believe it's best not to buy Tesla stock right now.
Expenses are rising fast Tesla CEO Elon Musk is transitioning his company toward an autonomous vehicle and robotics company.
Following the expiration of the federal EV tax credits, Tesla's vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November -- its lowest monthly sales in years.
However, the November vehicle sales numbers indicate that Tesla and other EV manufacturers have a significant problem on their hands.","Tesla (TSLA +3.44%) has been a fantastic stock for long-term investors, with returns exceeding 3,100% over the past decade. However, the company currently faces significant headwinds, as sales of its electric vehicles (EVs) are slowing, costs are rising, and it places big bets on unproven markets including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs).

It's no surprise, then, that many investors are trying to determine what to do with Tesla stock. Is it a good time to buy with its shares priced under $500, or is it too early to take a risk on the company transitioning toward future technologies when its EV business is slumping?

Here are three reasons why I believe it's best not to buy Tesla stock right now.

1. Expenses are rising fast

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is transitioning his company toward an autonomous vehicle and robotics company. The idea is for Tesla to mass-produce its Optimus robots -- up to 1 million by 2030 -- and for the company to vastly expand its fledgling robotaxi service that's currently only in a handful of cities. It's worth noting Musk said in July the service would cover half the country by the end of the year, which is now, and it's nowhere near achieving this.

There's nothing wrong with Tesla focusing on these two opportunities, considering that AVs could eventually be worth $1.4 trillion by 2040, and humanoid robotics will be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050.

But to achieve its goals, Tesla is spending heavily, and it's likely to increase from here. The company's operating expenses rose by 50% to $3.4 billion in the third quarter, and research and development (R&D) costs jumped 57% to $1.6 billion. Management specifically said the operating cost increase was ""driven by SG&A [selling, general, and administrative], AI and other R&D projects.""

For Tesla to expand into nascent robotics and AV markets, additional billions of dollars will need to be spent at a time when the company's core business -- selling electric vehicles -- isn't doing so hot.

2. Tesla's core business is suffering

It's easy to get caught up in Tesla's big plans to be an autonomous vehicle and robotics company, but Tesla is still primarily an electric vehicle company right now. Unfortunately, business is not so good.

Tesla's net income fell 37% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, leaving the company with significantly less money to reinvest in the business.

Things could be getting worse, too. Following the expiration of the federal EV tax credits, Tesla's vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November -- its lowest monthly sales in years. Tesla's third-quarter results temporarily received a boost as customers rushed to take advantage before credits expired at the end of September, which helped lift Tesla's revenue 12% to $28 billion in the quarter.

However, the November vehicle sales numbers indicate that Tesla and other EV manufacturers have a significant problem on their hands. EVs often cost more than traditional gas-powered vehicles, and after years of inflation and high interest rates, and no more tax credits, there's less demand for EVs than in the recent past.

This would be a significant problem on its own for Tesla, but it's compounded by the fact that the company is spending so much to move into robotics and AVs.

3. Its stock is expensive

Even if Tesla somehow pulls off its transition to AVs and robotics and turns around its stumbling EV business, it doesn't eliminate the fact that investors are paying a high premium for a company as it makes risky moves.

Tesla's shares currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 206, far above the tech sector's average P/E ratio of about 45.

This means Tesla's stock is already priced for perfection at a time of significant transition, falling profit, and increasing expenses. That's too risky for my liking, even if Tesla eventually achieves its goals. I think investors are better off not buying Tesla stock right now, at least waiting until the company can prove that it can reinvigorate sales and earnings from its electric vehicle business.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847339%2Fnewmodely_65.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-18 18:01:40.142986

Hosted by the C2ES Regional Clean Economies Initiative, this cross-sectoral group of energy leaders offered achievable policy solutions to accelerate the development of the critical battery materials supply chain and deliver local economic benefits to the communities of the Southeast.
All agreed that realizing this opportunity requires regional cooperation and intentional, impactful, and intelligent policy solutions at all levels of government.
Our participants recommended financial incentives for domestic production of critical battery materials, paired with demand-side support to promote the consumption of American made products.
In 2026, we’re looking forward to building these big ideas into actionable recommendations through a regional policy roadmap.","In conversations across the Southeast United States this year, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions convened over 150 energy leaders to discuss one of the hottest topics around the American energy economy: critical materials and battery manufacturing. In every conversation, policymakers, companies and other stakeholders highlighted the work to secure a domestic critical materials supply through industrial development and innovation and create new American jobs.

Hosted by the C2ES Regional Clean Economies Initiative, this cross-sectoral group of energy leaders offered achievable policy solutions to accelerate the development of the critical battery materials supply chain and deliver local economic benefits to the communities of the Southeast.

Although near-term projections for the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market have cooled slightly, global battery demand is rising at a rapid pace. Many American companies and communities across the emerging “battery belt” possess the capabilities to supply the key materials and components that go into these products, creating massive opportunity to capture the economic benefits of building out this supply chain domestically.

Through C2ES roundtable convenings in Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia, we gathered expertise from leaders of communities, workers, economic developers, local businesses, academic experts, state policymakers, entrepreneurs and more. Each echoed that the battery industry brings tremendous tangible job creation and investment opportunities to their region. All agreed that realizing this opportunity requires regional cooperation and intentional, impactful, and intelligent policy solutions at all levels of government.

In Tennessee, we heard from startups and Fortune 500 companies alike about the challenges they face in a rapidly shifting policy environment, and the importance of a stable incentive and regulatory structure that enables predictable investment decisions.

In Alabama, we learned about the importance of an integrated economic development and policy strategy that focuses on industry-driven research and development, prioritizes intentional workforce development, and leans into the state’s competitive advantage within the broader regional value chain.

In North Carolina, we explored the many different shapes and sizes of companies and research efforts in this industry that can span raw materials extraction to final battery assembly, and talked about the importance of collaboration among companies, policymakers, and leaders across state lines.

Finally, in Georgia, we learned about how the state’s proactive economic development strategy to land some of the largest electric vehicle and battery factories in the region helped solidify Georgia as an anchor for the many suppliers and innovative technology developers in the region.

Though each of these conversations brought their own unique local opportunities and challenges, we heard a common refrain from the more than 150 leaders brought together: with the right combination of policy support and private sector investment, the Southeast United States is ready and willing to be the center of the global battery industry.

What would that support look like? Our participants recommended financial incentives for domestic production of critical battery materials, paired with demand-side support to promote the consumption of American made products. They talked about stronger coordination and acceleration of cutting-edge research and development efforts, with a focus on integrating industry needs and bridging the gap from pilot projects to commercialization. They highlighted the importance of proactive workforce development that brings current and future workers into the emerging battery industry while prioritizing transferrable skills and pathways to long-term careers in an advanced and rapidly evolving sector. They recommended smart standards and guidelines for building battery manufacturing facilities and battery storage installations that prioritize safety and remain flexible to the unique needs of the communities that host them.

Under the Regional Clean Economies Initiative in 2025, we were able to bring stakeholders new and old, big and small together to land on shared principles and offer smart policy solutions for the Southeast. In 2026, we’re looking forward to building these big ideas into actionable recommendations through a regional policy roadmap. C2ES will reconvene our network of leaders and advocates at a regional summit in April 2026 to finalize this roadmap and work towards domestic energy solutions needed for a thriving, growing economy.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-1570041382-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:56.553474

The Act guts the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – a bedrock environmental protection – to make it easier for Big Oil and other polluting industries to inflict their projects on communities.
By undercutting NEPA, the SPEED Act would allow fossil fuel companies and other polluting corporations to cut corners in environmental reviews; bury information about the risks posed by their dirty, dangerous projects; and silence community opposition.
In response to the SPEED Act’s passage in the House, national environmental groups and organizations representing communities fighting fossil fuel projects said: “The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for.
The SPEED Act would remove that protection, and when public review is cut off and independent science is ignored, corporations get to externalize pollution, illness, flooding, and the loss of livelihoods onto families who never had a say.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the House of Representatives passed the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R. 4776). The Act guts the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – a bedrock environmental protection – to make it easier for Big Oil and other polluting industries to inflict their projects on communities.

By undercutting NEPA, the SPEED Act would allow fossil fuel companies and other polluting corporations to cut corners in environmental reviews; bury information about the risks posed by their dirty, dangerous projects; and silence community opposition. It would also drastically curtail communities’ ability to hold polluters accountable through the courts.

Yesterday, more than 70 organizations sent a letter to members of Congress expressing their strong opposition to the bill.

In response to the SPEED Act’s passage in the House, national environmental groups and organizations representing communities fighting fossil fuel projects said:

“The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for. Instead of pushing the SPEED Act – a bill that would strip away what few legal protections communities still have, weaken safeguards for clean air, land, and water near new industrial development, and sidestep meaningful consultation with federally recognized Tribal Nations – Congress should be advancing real, community-driven permitting reform. Examples include the Environmental Justice for All Act, which lays out meaningful public engagement, strong public-health protections, respect for Tribal sovereignty and consultation obligations, and serious investments in agencies and staff.” – Mar Zepeda Salazar, Legislative Director, Climate Justice Alliance

“The baseline environmental protection found in NEPA is not red tape – it is the public’s seat at the table and one of the only tools communities have to protect their health, homes, and future. The SPEED Act would remove that protection, and when public review is cut off and independent science is ignored, corporations get to externalize pollution, illness, flooding, and the loss of livelihoods onto families who never had a say. The SPEED Act protects corporate interests, not the public, and it should be rejected by any senator who claims to stand with the people.” – James Hiatt, For a Better Bayou

“Organizing in New Mexico, I’ve seen how hard our communities fight just to protect what should never be up for negotiation – our air, our water, our health, and our future. Gutting NEPA is an open invitation for Big Oil to deepen the extraction, pollution, and harm we already face in the Permian Basin, in Greater Chaco, and across our rural, Indigenous, and working-class communities. Instead of weakening our last lines of defense, Congress should be strengthening environmental protections, investing in community-led solutions, and honoring the voices of the people who live with the consequences of extraction every single day.”- Feleecia Guillen, New Mexico Fellow, Institute for Policy Studies

“The SPEED Act represents yet another assault on the health of frontline, Black, Brown, Indigenous and poor white communities that have been designated as sacrifice zones by big polluters who bribe lawmakers with big money to continue a culture of extract, slash, burn, and emit at the expense of oppressed and marginalized peoples. Worse yet, this piece of industry-friendly legislation will take away due process from impacted communities by removing their right to sue big polluters who purposely select the places they call home to be dumped on and contaminated. Rather than speeding up the approval of dirty projects, Congress should increase funding for federal agencies and grassroots organizations accountable to frontline communities to carry out legally defensible and accurate environmental analyses as called for by Reps. Raúl Grijalva and McEachin in their landmark Environmental Justice for All Act.” – Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright, Co-Coordinator Black Alliance for Peace Climate, Environment and Militarism Initiative

“The SPEED Act favors golden calf solutions and the idolatry of profits above a people-centered economy and a planet where we can all thrive. It sacrifices community voices and environmental standards as a hasty concession to industry, allowing fossil fuel and corporate polluters to cut corners, suppress science, and sideline communities during routine review procedures. It is legislation at the expense of community and environmental well-being. We support legislation that upholds justice, stewardship, and the dignity of the human family, rejecting the SPEED Act’s inadequate solutions.” – Pablo DeJesús, Executive Director, Unitarian Universalists for Social Justice

“The SPEED Act is a handout to fossil fuel companies and other big polluters at the expense of working people. Its sponsors include major recipients of Big Oil money like Bruce Westerman and Henry Cuellar. The bill lets the fossil fuel industry steamroll community opposition to their dangerous projects, suppress science on a project’s potential harms, and ignore climate consequences. Our senators must stand up against the SPEED Act’s attempts to undermine democratic decision-making, pollute our communities, and threaten our collective future.” – Allie Rosenbluth, U.S. Campaign Manager, Oil Change International

“Tribal Nations in California are challenged with various laws and policies that perpetuate erasure and uphold extractive economies that lead to irreversible destruction to our lands, waters, and all beings. The SPEED Act will likely deepen the barriers that are imposed on Indigenous Peoples and Indigenous Sovereignty, as this could: reduce the Tribal participation in the environmental reviews, accelerate permitting, and continue the legacy of settler-driven climate catastrophes. Congress must acknowledge that this is not the solution to achieving climate justice and would further burden Indigenous Peoples by diluting our inherent and sovereign rights; all decisions must be rooted in Free, Prior, and Informed consent– not deregulation.” – Starry Insixiengmay (Cahuilla), Ending Extractive Industries in Our Homelands Project Director, Sacred Places Institute For Indigenous Peoples

Backers of AI and other facilities that consume large amounts of power say that co-locating them near power plants offers efficiency benefits, including cutting the need for new transmission lines. Opponents say it can damage grid reliability and raise power bills for surrounding communities by reducing electricity available for public use.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the move will protect consumers in the mid-Atlantic region that serves about a fifth of Americans in 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Laura Swett, the FERC chairman, said the order was a “monumental step towards fortifying America’s national and economic security in the AI revolution,” and would ensure power rates remain “just and reasonable.”

Washington policy advisory firm Capstone called the order a “major victory” for existing nuclear and gas plants, as it directs PJM to implement rules that allow power stations to reduce output to the grid to serve new behind the meter customers such as data centers.

Power bills for the region are expected to continue to rise after PJM on Wednesday reported fresh record-high capacity prices that reflected electricity demand by data centers overtaking supplies.

The expansion of Big Tech’s data centers has driven up so-called capacity prices in PJM by about 1,000% over a roughly two-year period, intensifying energy affordability problems for those living and working in the region.

Rising costs in PJM have hit power bills in the grid’s territory, with some areas seeing a more than 20% jump in utility bills starting from last summer.

FERC took aim at PJM’s open access transmission tariff, which the operator says governs its services in the region to allow for a fair and competitive wholesale electricity market.

The agency said the tariff was “unjust and unreasonable due to a lack of clarity and consistency in the rates, terms, and conditions.” It directed PJM to revise its tariff to detail the terms and conditions for interconnection customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load.

PJM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If passed by the Senate and signed into law, it would slash requirements mandated by the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a foundational environmental law.

NEPA outlines a robust process for environmental reviews based on scientific rigor, transparency and deliberation, all of which require appropriate time and effort. It is also one of the few laws that communities can use to highlight environmental justice concerns.

Below is a statement by David Watkins, director of government affairs for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“This bill is a sizeable holiday gift basket for Big Oil and Gas. It includes goodies like shielding fossil fuel projects from meaningful review or public input before they are permitted, then shielding them from legal recourse after they are approved. Our elected officials are letting people down by supporting this regressive legislation designed to give an antiquated industry more time to profit from their dangerous and deadly polluting at a time when our communities, our economy and our planet need forward-looking clean energy policies. The bill even allows federal agencies to ignore scientific or technical information related to permit applications. Circumventing science and denying reality will only lead to greater harm to our environment and worse outcomes for communities.

The nonprofit recipients of $14 billion in climate grants frozen by the Environmental Protection Agency can have their case reheard, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said in a Wednesday ruling.

A three-judge panel had ruled 2-1 on Sept. 2 to uphold the freeze on funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. On Sept. 10, the plaintiffs requested a rehearing en banc, meaning all judges of that particular court would have to hear the case.

The court agreed to that rehearing, and the en banc court will hear further oral arguments in the case on Feb. 24. However, the court left in place the partial administrative stay issued in April, meaning the GGRF grant funding will remain frozen for now.

The majority opinion upholding the funding freeze was filed by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump — Judge Neomi Rao and Judge Gregory Katsas. The panel’s dissenting judge, Nina Pillard, was appointed by President Barack Obama.

“The month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements — with no apparent consideration from the grantees — to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants” Rao and Katsas wrote, adding that “nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed.”

The GGRF provided “nearly $27 billion in competitive grants to mobilize financing and leverage private capital for clean energy and climate projects that reduce pollution – with an emphasis on projects that benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities,” according to a fact sheet produced by the Biden EPA.

Grant recipients included “green bank” nonprofits such as the Climate United coalition, which received almost $7 billion to finance clean energy projects in rural, tribal and low-income communities, and the Coalition for Green Capital, which received $5 billion and was working to design, create and implement other green bank programs.

An amicus curiae brief filed Sept. 17 by Democratic members of Congress said, “After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations.”

They argued that the administration’s attempts to claw back the funding “[ignored] Congressional spending power” and amounted to a “constitutional power grab.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made fraud allegations in March, saying the Biden administration’s rush to award grants before the Trump administration took over was tantamount to “throwing gold bars off the Titanic” and alleged “instances of self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and intentionally reduced agency oversight” within the GGRF program.

Of the full court’s 15 judges, four are Obama appointees, three are Biden appointees, three are Trump appointees, one is an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, and four judges have senior status and would not vote on an en banc petition.

The administration unjustly and arbitrarily singled out solar and wind projects for these more restrictive – and unprecedented – eligibility rules.
“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC.
“The guidance has forced us to change our plans, and the Hopi Utilities Corporation is now racing to qualify for tax credits under the new guidelines.
In rules issued in August, the IRS eliminated the five percent standard for all wind projects and solar projects larger than 1.5 megawatts.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – A broad array of groups with strong interests in clean and affordable energy sued the IRS and Treasury Department over new rules for tax credits that unfairly and illegally discriminate against wind and solar projects.

As part of a series of attacks on wind and solar, the IRS eliminated a key pathway for companies to demonstrate they have begun construction and thus qualify for federal tax credits before they expire on July 4, 2026. The administration unjustly and arbitrarily singled out solar and wind projects for these more restrictive – and unprecedented – eligibility rules.

The IRS guidance “unlawfully changes the tests for beginning of construction for only solar and wind facilities, without providing adequate reasons or data for treating those facilities differently from all other industries,” the filing says. This change is “likely to increase power prices, resulting in higher electric rates and bills for consumers.”

This lawsuit asks the court to declare the rules arbitrary and capricious and reject them, restoring projects’ ability to rely on the prior rules that had been in place for more than a decade.

The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today by a coalition of groups, led by the Oregon Environmental Council. Other plaintiffs are: NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Public Citizen, Hopi Utilities Corporation, Woven Energy, the City and County of San Francisco, and the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.

“Oregon is counting on renewable energy. The Trump administration’s unfair decision to pull the rug out from under wind and solar projects will lock Oregon ratepayers into expensive, polluting energy sources,” said Jana Gastellum, executive director of Oregon Environmental Council. “Oregonians are already paying the price through devastating wildfires, toxic air pollution, and extreme weather. We can't afford to go backwards – not when the climate crisis is worsening, and communities are suffering.”

The filing also notes that this is part of a series of actions by the Trump administration to block renewable energy, listing 11 specific measures it has taken to stop or delay wind or solar projects. Those actions are putting a damper on much-needed new electricity generation, restricting supply just as utility prices are skyrocketing across the nation.

“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC. “This is bad for clean energy, bad for workers and communities, bad for the air we all breathe, and horrible for Americans squeezed by higher utility bills.”

“These new IRS rules have been a harsh blow. We have been counting on new solar projects to get electricity to those without it, help support essential services, and to create and provide jobs,” said Tim Nuvangyaoma, former Chairman of the Hopi Tribe. “The guidance has forced us to change our plans, and the Hopi Utilities Corporation is now racing to qualify for tax credits under the new guidelines. Getting the court to rectify this unjust action would give us the certainty we need.”

""In Maryland, hundreds of thousands of households live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to pay their utility bills,"" said Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp. ""Adding renewable energy lowers those bills and eliminates fuel cost price volatility. The Treasury Department’s guidance is a nonsensical attack on clean energy and an assault on affordable energy at a time when Marylanders can least afford it.""

“Undercutting solar and wind projects will drive up energy prices for average Americans and cities like San Francisco,” said San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu. “Clean energy developers need predictability and certainty to build projects that benefit us all. San Francisco is joining this coalition to fight for our clean energy future and keep energy costs affordable for consumers.”

“The Trump administration’s use of the IRS to target wind and solar energy projects will result in even higher electricity prices for consumers,” said Nandan Joshi, attorney with Public Citizen's Litigation Group. “Congress wanted to encourage investment in new, cleaner power generation without favoring any one technology. By using the tax code to wage war on wind and solar energy, the Trump administration will cause electric bills to rise, workers to lose their jobs, and older, dirtier power plants to spew more pollution into our air.”

Background

Last year’s Republican tax law cut tax credits for solar and wind and provided a transition period for projects that begin construction within a year.

For more than a decade, Congress has established that an energy project could qualify for a tax credit if it began construction on that project before certain statutory deadlines. This provided certainty to companies that their project would qualify for the tax benefits even if they faced unforeseen delays. IRS rules have long held that starting construction could mean either spending five percent of the total project costs or beginning physical work of a significant nature.

The so-called “Five Percent Safe Harbor” is what is at issue in today’s lawsuit.

Days after passage of the tax law, President Trump issued an Executive Order to “eliminate” clean energy incentives. The order specifically directed the agencies to revise the IRS’s guidance on the meaning “beginning of construction” for wind and solar facilities. In rules issued in August, the IRS eliminated the five percent standard for all wind projects and solar projects larger than 1.5 megawatts. The lawsuit today argues IRS’s elimination of that option is without any legal rationale. Moreover, sources like nuclear, geothermal and hydropower did not face these new restrictions.

The case concerns an IRS notice issued on August 15 titled “Beginning of Construction Requirements for Purposes of the Termination of Clean Electricity Production Credits and Clean Electricity Investment Credits for Applicable Wind and Solar Facilities.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:59.718094

This story originally appeared in Canary Media and is republished here with permission.

Ford, a century after it launched the modern automotive era, has given up on its early ambitions to charge into the electrified future.

The company announced that it will delete nearly $20 billion in book value to extricate itself from its EV investments, an eye-popping loss that amounts to one of the biggest corporate impairments ever.

The company, of course, views it differently: The move is a ​“decisive redeployment of capital,” it said on Monday, as it rolled out a string of related strategic changes alongside the write-down.

The pivot hits particularly hard in the southeastern Battery Belt, where Ford had invested in multibillion-dollar BlueOval plants to produce batteries and electric vehicles. The EV battery facility in Glendale, Kentucky, will lay off about 1,600 employees, and local outlet the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported that a Ford factory in Tennessee will hire around 1,000 fewer workers than previously planned, now that it is making gas trucks instead of electric ones.

As Ford retreats from EVs, though, it’s enthusiastically embracing battery-making — announcing plans to repurpose the Kentucky plant to fuel its entrance into the grid storage market. It expects to spend roughly $2 billion over the next two years to launch production of lithium iron phosphate cells and package them into 20-foot containers that hold at least 5 megawatt-hours of storage capacity, equivalent to a Tesla Megapack. The plan is to ship at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

“This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford,” the company said in a statement. Ford also plans to make cells for home battery units at its factory in Marshall, Michigan.

Ford recently cut a deal with partner SK On, the South Korean battery maker, to dissolve their joint venture. Ford will keep the Kentucky battery plant while SK On takes the one at the sprawling BlueOval City complex near Memphis, Tennessee. That means batteries will still be made in that factory, just not exclusively for Ford products.

“They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at financial services firm Raymond James. ​“While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Ford’s sunny rhetoric about a ​“customer-driven shift” can’t hide the sheer enormity of the blow to its overall business.

As of Sept. 30, Ford’s accountants pegged its corporate value at more than $47 billion. Now Ford must lower that by $19.5 billion to reflect the dissolution of the joint venture agreement with SK On and the loss of planned EV models. The company will have to spend money to end production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, switch to producing a gas-and-battery-powered extended-range model, and retool factories for new, non-EV production.

The move comes as EVs account for just about 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S., far below the global figure of 25%. Though EV sales reach new records each year, the rate of growth has slowed, and there’s little reason to expect momentum to improve given recent federal policy changes.

“U.S. EV sales have never lived up to expectations,” said Molchanov. ​“That was true even while the tax credit was in place. Now, there’s no more tax credit, and EV sales have fallen off a proverbial cliff.”

The consumer EV tax credit ended in September as a result of the Republican budget law, taking away an incentive that helped lower or eliminate the premium for buying electric compared to a similar gas-powered model. Now, too, the average price of regular gasoline has dipped below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, while residential electricity prices rose 13% over the first three-quarters of this year, much faster than inflation.

“In terms of commodity prices, this is the worst of both worlds for EVs,” Molchanov said.

Energy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters

Ford’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.

It used to be that EVs were on the exponential growth curve, and stationary storage offered a modest side hustle for any leftover batteries. Now, between American automakers’ apparent inability to make affordable models and the Trump administration’s slashing and burning of federal EV incentives, that market is heading for some doldrums.

Grid battery providers, by contrast, are seeing business surge. Revenue from Tesla’s energy division, home to the Powerwall home battery and Megapack for large-scale storage, grew 67% last year compared to 2023, and broke $10 billion for the first time, even as the company’s market-leading EV business lost revenue.

Overall, the U.S. will install a record amount of battery capacity on the grid this year. Though analysts predict some dropoff over the next couple of years as the industry adapts to new federal anti-China rules, the utility-scale outlook through 2030 has actually increased 15% since the first half of this year, according to industry group American Clean Power.

Demand from AI data centers plays a massive role in that: Hyperscalers are realizing that strategically placed batteries can unlock capacity at critical constrained hours, in some cases letting the companies build computing hubs years earlier than they could if they waited for conventional grid upgrades. Ford, not coincidentally, will target data centers with its new battery products.

The grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China. But when President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, he preserved federal tax incentives for energy storage deployment while adding a new bureaucratic regime to make projects prove they don’t source parts from China in excess of newly set limits.

Starting in 2026, that will push storage developers to source U.S.-made batteries. There aren’t a lot of options today: LG, after making EV batteries in Michigan for years, began producing lithium iron phosphate cells there for grid use earlier this year. Tesla, Fluence, and others are following suit — in fact, the U.S. is on track for self-sufficiency in cell production for grid storage use by the end of 2026, according to the Energy Storage Coalition.

If project developers end up in a race to secure scarce domestic supply come 2027 or 2028, Ford could find eager buyers in spite of its short track record.

Still, that’s no guarantee of success. Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers. Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/04.01.25-KY-Plant-14.webp,N,,2025-12-18 15:00:28.331247

The Paint Bay was reported to have been used to repaint vehicles and other mobile machinery that would fit into the garage-sized bay. Building 541, a former maintenance shop, is also located within the SWMU 52 area. Building 542 has a floor drain connected to an underground pipe that exits the building to the south and then runs southwest to the oil-water separator (Building A541). The floor drain collected wastewater associated with Paint Bay and tire shop operations. The paint bay area includes three 4-foot diameter exhaust fans along the east and south walls to discharge paint fumes and particulates. The east wall discharged fumes through a vented exhaust fume hood. Along the south wall fumes were discharged through two fans located within an exhaust fan housing constructed of plywood and sheet metal. Painting operations were reportedly discontinued at the facility in the mid-1970s.

In 1989, a visual site inspection was conducted. As part of the inspection, the U.S. Army identified staining on the outside wall of Building 542 and on the ground surface around the exhaust fans described above. Through correspondence between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the U.S. Army, SWMU 52 was identified as a potential release site, as certain paints and associated products used at SWMU 52 may have contained hazardous or toxic constituents. The USEPA recognized that the potential for contaminant migration from this site to potential receptors was low (Dames & Moore, 1989).

In 2000, a RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) for soils at SWMU 52 was conducted by Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns & McDonnell). Laboratory analytical data collected during this RFI were later determined to be unreliable due to laboratory malfeasance; therefore, the data was not used and is not presented here.

In 2003, a subsequent RFI at SWMU 52 for soils was conducted by Shaw Environmental, Inc. (Shaw). Four surface soil samples were collected and analyzed for SFAAP metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and phthalates (a subset of semi-volatile organic compounds [SVOCs]). The locations of samples collected during the Shaw RFI were biased toward known potential release sites or potential runoff accumulation areas. Analytical results were non-detect or at concentrations below the residential target media cleanup levels (TMCLs) for all analytes. Based on these results, a request for NFA for soils at SWMU 52 was written by the Army and submitted to KDHE in April 2007. KDHE provided concurrence that the Army had completed all necessary work associated with soil at SWMU 52 on April 1, 2009.

In a letter dated May 8, 2008, KDHE requested that a groundwater investigation be conducted at SWMU 52. In response to this request, a supplemental RFI was conducted by WSP USA Solutions Inc. (WSP) and Burns & McDonell in 2021 to characterize groundwater contaminant concentrations at SWMU 52. As part of the investigation, two groundwater samples were collected downgradient of the potential Building 542 release areas and analyzed for SFAAP metals, VOCs, and phthalates. Analytical results were non-detect or at concentrations below their respective residential TMCLs indicating there is no groundwater contamination originating from SWMU 52.

The KDHE have determined that NFA with restrictions for soil and site-specific groundwater is the appropriate remedy for SWMU 52. No COCs were identified in soil or groundwater. Remaining soil and groundwater contamination as a result of ACM, LBP, or pesticides will be adequately addressed through the restrictions imposed by the EUCA Number 25-EUC-0017.

U.S. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge Act, a federal labeling harmonization bill that’s been championed by Ameripen for over a year.

It would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to include certain requirements for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer product packaging, including that they make qualifying claims and are backed by third-party certifications. Packaging that doesn’t meet stated parameters would be prohibited from bearing resin identification codes surrounded by chasing arrows.

The bill also calls for state preemption. “This uniform structure will replace the confusing patchwork of state regulations, helping businesses provide accurate and transparent information across state lines,” Ameripen said in a news release Wednesday.

Dive Insight:

This federal push comes at a time when more packaging stakeholders are raising concerns about how differing state-level packaging regulations could inhibit interstate commerce. It’s also less than a year away from California’s planned implementation of SB 343, a landmark labeling law that will make it illegal for packaging to bear chasing arrows or other recycling indicators unless specific criteria are met.

All the while, unfinished efforts under the Biden administration to get clarity on best practices for sustainability claims by updating the non-binding FTC Green Guides have been quiet under the Trump administration.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Weber said in a statement. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

The bills calls on the FTC to, within a year, establish an advisory council of experts and industry stakeholders to meet annually. Within two years, the FTC would have to issue guidance on third-party certification, including considering different types of packaging materials, colors, shapes and sizes.

The bill text shared by Weber notes various criteria for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer product packaging.

For example, a “recyclable” package must inform consumers about the availability of recycling programs and collection sites where the item is sold by noting the percentage of consumer or communities with access.

At the same time, a package can be exempt from that requirement if “a recycling program or facility isavailable to a substantial majority of consumers or communities in which the consumer product is sold.” A package cannot be deemed recyclable if it’s made from a recyclable material but due to its shape, size or other attributes is not accepted in recycling programs.

“Compostable” claims require “competent and reliable scientific evidence that the packaging is compostable.” And “reusable” claims require that a person provide means for reusing the packaging through a systems of collection and reuse, or offer a product for purchase to reuse the original packaging.

Ameripen says that the third-party certification requirement “allows businesses to utilize a variety of qualified independent parties to certify that packaging meets industry standards and follows the FTC’s ‘Green Guides’ to avoid deceptive claims.”

“This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging,” said Executive Director Lynn Dyer in Weber’s press release. “Ameripen will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.”

Peter DePasquale, vice president of government affairs at Keurig Dr Pepper, said in a statement the bill is a welcome step to establish “a single, national framework for packaging claims.”

“By setting clear, national standards and certifications through credible third parties, this legislation helps ensure consumers receive accurate information while giving companies the consistency they need to innovate and accelerate investment in sustainable packaging solutions nationwide,” DePasquale said.

The Pack Act’s dozens of of other supporters include major packaging companies and CPGs such as Amcor, Anchor Packaging and Dart, and Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Nestlé USA. The legislation is widely supported by different packaging trade groups, including the Plastics Industry Association, EPS Industry Alliance, Biodegradable Products Institute, Can Manufacturers Institute, Carton Council, Foodservice Packaging Institute and more.

Flexible Packaging Association CEO Dan Felton said the group is “thrilled” about the Pack Act’s introduction “and looks forward to fully supporting its passage into law.”

“We believe that a federal law for the labeling of packaging for compostability, recyclability, and reusability that supports existing national labeling programs makes far greater sense than a state-by-state approach of passing related laws and will lead to more — not less — consumers properly handling flexible packaging at its end of life,” Felton said in an emailed statement.

The NMC to LFP macro-story The transition is considerably easier for manufacturers already producing EV batteries using LFP, a chemistry that China has long prioritized, but that did not become the preferred alternative for both stationary storage and EV batteries globally until the early 2020s.
Unlike LFP cells, which typically use a prismatic form factor for storage, NMC cells are often produced as pouch or cylindrical units.
“But it’s very hard to build an energy storage product or cell business if you’re not shipping prismatic LFP.
“Energy storage is one of the most important tools for grid resiliency.","Earlier this week, Ford Motor Company — arguably the most iconic U.S. automaker in the U.S. — began to inch into the energy space. The company, which a century ago revolutionized auto manufacturing through its use of the assembly line, announced plans to repurpose some of its “underutilized” EV manufacturing lines, and use them to build advanced energy storage systems instead.

The automaker said it will change over EV capacity at its plant in Glendale, Kentucky, to manufacture storage systems of five-plus megawatt-hours, which it hopes to start bringing online in 2027. This will be the starting point for a new Ford energy storage business; it plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years “to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid.”

This is the latest, and most high-profile, example of a pivot that has seen a growing group of manufacturers, including LG Energy and SK On, repurposing some of the capacity they built up when U.S. forecasts for EV sales were rosier. (Fellow automaker GM is also participating in the trend, but instead of repurposing lines, it is giving some of its new and used EV batteries to Redwood Energy to deploy in hybrid storage solutions for data centers.)

The Trump administration’s elimination of subsidies for EVs last summer is leaving battery manufacturers with more capacity than they can hope to deploy in the short term. At the same time, the energy storage industry is experiencing some tailwinds; the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill left the full value of its tax credits intact until 2033, as batteries become more important to powering data centers and meeting record load growth.

So, according to Daniel Finn-Foley, director of energy storage at Clean Energy Associates, it’s only logical for an EV battery manufacturer with the requisite expertise, factories, and supply chain already in place to get into the stationary storage business as well. “If you already have a battery plant up and running, converting that to stationary storage is an effort to preserve some of the economic value of that facility when it may otherwise have to close or scale back production,” he told Latitude Media.

The shift, however, is neither cheap nor particularly easy. Analysts estimate the conversion can cost up to a third of a facility’s total capex and take up to 18 months — a timeline reflected in Ford’s plan, which doesn’t see storage capacity coming online until 2027.

From density to lifecycle

As an investor at VC firm Piva Capital, Lee Larson has been in many conversations with both battery companies and automakers about “the shift away from EVs and towards stationary storage,” a trend he says everyone has seen and is trying to understand.

He says that the key element of the shift is the fact that EVs and BESS have a fundamental difference in priorities: EV batteries require high gravimetric energy density to maximize range, while BESS prioritizes cycle life to ensure long-term value.

“In EVs, the watt-hours per kilogram define your range and performance, but EVs only need 1,000 cycles, which, depending on your energy density, could be 300,000 miles of lifetime range,” Larson said. “For energy storage, the metric of value is dollar per cycle… and the leading cells can now get 8,000 cycles or more, which improves the economics over a 20-year lifetime.”

This pivot from prioritizing density to lifecycles drives a shift toward physically larger cells, which require some retooling of the cell line for thicker electrodes and different additives, as well as the replacement of the pack assembly lines to build bigger grid-ready racks instead of flat, thin batteries that can fit into an EV.

The NMC to LFP macro-story

The transition is considerably easier for manufacturers already producing EV batteries using LFP, a chemistry that China has long prioritized, but that did not become the preferred alternative for both stationary storage and EV batteries globally until the early 2020s. Most U.S. factories, however, are built for NMC chemistries, which dominated Western manufacturing in the late 2010s; they largely only started the slow transition to using LFPs after Tesla incorporated them into its standard-range EVs in late 2021.

Unlike LFP cells, which typically use a prismatic form factor for storage, NMC cells are often produced as pouch or cylindrical units. Ryan Gibson, a venture partner at VC firm Eclipse, where he’s helped build companies including sodium-ion battery manufacturer Peak Energy, says this makes things harder, as switching lines from NMC to LFP requires changes not only to the internal chemistry but also to the machinery used to shape the cells.

“When you’re changing the fundamental form factor of the cell, you’re going to be reinvesting considerable capex…It’s a huge hill climb,” Gibson said. “But it’s very hard to build an energy storage product or cell business if you’re not shipping prismatic LFP. So, if your goal is to enter that market and you’re sitting on old capex for old chemistries that can’t sell into that market, you sort of have to switch over.”

In its announcement, Ford said it’s planning to produce LFP prismatic cells for its new storage business, as well as battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems. The company had started introducing LFP batteries for its EVs in 2023, including for its F-150 Lightning trucks; the latter, which is the electric version of one of the best-selling cars in the U.S., was scrapped as part of Monday’s pivot.

Broadly, according to Larson, this EVs-to-storage battery trend is the continuation of the necessary transition from NMC to LFP that was already happening in the market before the policy headwinds against EVs materialized. “Over the past couple of years, most of the non-Chinese players were already struggling with relatively low capacity utilization on their NMC lines,” he said. “The big, broader macro-story here is the rise and dominance of LFP from a cost performance perspective.”

The EV manufacturers’ relatively quick embrace of BESS is also a manifestation of the battery industry’s resilience and ability to adapt to “seismic shifts in the market,” according to Finn-Foley. Just in the past seven years, he noted, the industry went through shifts including a supply crunch that occurred because demand was being eaten up by incentives within South Korea; the sudden shift to LFP batteries from NMC chemistries; and a 10x spike and drop of lithium prices.

“This is an industry that is constantly shifting, and people underestimate the creativity of developers in terms of reducing cost and getting manufacturing online,” he said. “Energy storage is one of the most important tools for grid resiliency. So it’s appropriate that the supply chain itself would be resilient as well. Resiliency is in the DNA of the storage industry itself.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-18T125247.950.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:59:45.505208

Christian. “By supporting advanced, emissions-free transportation and generation, we are spurring the creation of a clean energy economy, helping to create good paying jobs, and ensuring that New York’s energy system remains reliable and affordable for customers.”

Clean Energy Standard: The Commission approved, with modifications, NYSERDA’s 2026 CES administrative budget, including funding the ZEC program via an administrative adder. NYSERDA had requested $34.78 million to support the 2026 CES compliance year budget. The Commission ultimately approved a budget of $31.4 million, a 15 percent decrease from the CES 2025 budget. This budget modification was to reflect the current renewable project landscape and reduce the burden on ratepayers. This funding will support NYSERDA’s CES staff salaries and overhead, system development, technical support, and the New York State Cost Recovery Fee. NYSERDA will fund its 2026 CES administrative budget with revenues from previous years including bid fees, alternative compliance payments, and interest income. The ZEC program would continue to be funded with an administrative adder. NYSERDA's CES budget addresses the continued growth of workload for the administration of CES programs including managing more than 100 renewable energy generator contracts.

In a related ZEC action, the Commission accepted the final SGEIS related to the ZEC program extension proposal. With the SGEIS finalized, the Commission may now prepare a findings statement as required under the State Environmental Quality Review Act. A findings statement is required before the Commission may act on the underlying ZEC program extension proposal.

Clean Transportation Prize: The Commission approved, with modifications, NYSERDA’s petition for its Clean Transportation Prize Program. In its petition, NYSERDA requested a two-year extension for nine of the 10 Clean Transportation Prize winners and a five-year extension for one of the Clean Transportation Prize winners. After the petition was filed, NYSERDA submitted a notice advising that two of the awarded projects had been cancelled. Additionally, NYSERDA requested a budget increase of approximately $500,000, or 15 percent, to provide additional program implementation support to administer the program for a longer period than originally anticipated. Finally, the petition proposes additional, publicly available, reporting requirements.

The Commission also approved the additional reporting requirements to ensure greater visibility and oversight of NYSERDA's administration of the Clean Transportation Prize Program, but the Commission denied the budget modification NYSERDA sought because there are now fewer projects to manage.

The Sierra Club, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the challenge in state court, citing the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s failure to provide proper public notice, allow for public comment, or give an opportunity for a public hearing on the agency’s re-issuance of its coastal use permit for construction of the Commonwealth LNG facility. LDCE also relied entirely on the final Commonwealth Environmental Impact Study to re-issue the permit, despite an earlier D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that EIS unlawful, and failed to adequately consider the environmental justice and climate change impacts that a state court judge had ordered in throwing out Commonwealth’s first coastal use permit in October.

If built, Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already staggering permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects. The liquefied methane gas, known as LNG, it would export would have annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 14 coal-fired power plants or 13 million new gasoline powered vehicles.

The Sierra Club, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and Turtle Island Restoration Network released the following statements:

“Commonwealth LNG would destroy vital storm buffers, wetlands, and fishing sites, but LDCE refuses to do the right thing and put a stop to this project,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club Managing Attorney. “The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted. By refusing to allow public comment– and using a faulty study to justify its decision– LDCE is attempting to shrug off its responsibility to represent and protect the people of Louisiana.”

“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, Director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “One of the concerns was for the fishermen in Cameron Parish, and the revised version does not address this issue at all. Our fishermen’s livelihoods are threatened by the pollution and tanker traffic already in the area, yet the department is turning a blind eye toward their struggles. It’s sad when our own state would put a corporation ahead of our fishermen. The department has done nothing more than rubber stamp a permit for an out-of-state corporation that has never cared about our home and never will.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:29.243267

Connecticut’s Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) energy efficiency programs, implemented by Connecticut’s utilities with oversight from DEEP and the state’s Energy Efficiency Board, continue to provide significant energy and bill savings benefits to ratepayers.","(HARTFORD, CT) – Governor Ned Lamont, chairman of the State Bond Commission, today announced that the commission voted at its meeting this morning to approve an allocation of $18 million in bond funding that will be used to establish the Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund – a new state loan and grant program that will assist in making energy efficiency upgrades at existing single-family and multi-family homes and helping residents generate savings on energy bills.

Administered by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), this program will be used to help with the retrofitting costs of items such as the installation of more efficient heating and cooling equipment, building envelope upgrades, and other similar items that produce energy savings. The program will build on the success of DEEP’s most recent barrier remediation program, the Residential Energy Preparation Services program, which recently utilized all its available funding, removing hazards in dozens of homes, clearing the path for money saving efficiency upgrades.

The establishment of the program and its related bond funding was authorized by the Connecticut General Assembly through Public Act 25-125, which Governor Lamont signed into law this summer.

“Energy efficiency improvements are a huge part of the way that savings can be generated on energy bills,” Governor Lamont said. “One of the great things about energy efficient upgrades is that they help reduce costs and increase reliability for all ratepayers – not just the person installing an energy efficient upgrade – by reducing wasted energy across the electric grid. With this funding, we’re also removing barriers that prevent people from being able to install energy efficient upgrades. Everyone should be able to realize the savings that can come from installing energy efficient upgrades in the home. Altogether, these funds will help expand affordable housing in Connecticut by rehabilitating existing housing and integrating energy upgrades that lower utility costs, improve resident comfort, and extend building life.”

“The Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund builds on DEEP’s commitment to addressing high utility costs for low-income residents,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “With housing and utility costs rising, this funding is essential to help residents and developers, who live in or own low income single and multifamily buildings, access weatherization and energy efficiency measures that can lower utility bills, increase comfort and safety, and keep housing costs affordable.”

When the program begins, $12 million from this initial $18 million allocation will be used to provide loans for developers to install energy upgrades and retrofits in existing multifamily affordable housing, including but not limited to more efficient heating and cooling equipment and building envelope upgrades.

The remaining $6 million will go toward removing barriers that prevent people in lower-income, single family homes from making their homes more energy efficient. Barriers include asbestos, knob and tube wiring, mold, and moisture. These barriers disqualify homes from state and federal weatherization and energy upgrade programs, as contractors are unable to move forward with energy audits, window and insulation installation, and other measures if such barriers are present. For example, in 2024, about 30% of Home Energy Solutions – Income Eligible units and 50% of Weatherization Assistance Program units were deferred due to health and safety barriers. Lower-income residents face the highest energy burden, or percentage of gross income spent on energy bills, and without funding for barrier remediation these homes cannot proceed with weatherization work and therefore are not able to improve their energy efficiency, which can save money on utility bills and increase home comfort.

In 2024, DEEP compiled public input related to this funding through a request for information, where respondents highlighted gaps and challenges in the affordable housing energy efficiency space, such as lack of technical assistance, difficultly accessing financing, high costs, health and safety barriers, and market confusion. Additionally, DEEP held three Affordable Multifamily Stakeholder Roundtables in June that produced similar key takeaways and sparked the creation of an interagency working group to discuss coordination among their various affordable multifamily programs.

The next steps in the establishment of the Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund include determining the process to recruit entities that can implement the program. DEEP hopes to solidify a process for entity selection by early to mid-2026, with the goal of initial program launch for both the grants and loans by end of 2026.

Funding complements other recent efforts to reduce energy costs

The funding and establishment of this program complement other efforts Governor Lamont has enacted recently to help reduce energy costs. These include:

Governor Lamont signed energy affordability legislation this year that will save ratepayers at least $300 million on their electricity bills over the next two years, and more in future years.

Public Act 25-173 was a collaborative, bipartisan effort to provide rate relief immediately and over the longer term to Connecticut residents and businesses facing costly utility bills.

Connecticut was recently recognized for its passage of Public Act 25-173 and Public Act 25-125 by the National League of Conservation Voters in its 2025 Clean Energy Report.

The $300 million includes savings to ratepayers of $125 million annually in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027 by shifting hardship protection measure costs off electric bills to state bonds; and $30 million in savings in fiscal year 2026 and $20 million in fiscal year 2027 by shifting electric vehicle charging program costs off electric bills to state bonds.

Connecticut’s Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) energy efficiency programs, implemented by Connecticut’s utilities with oversight from DEEP and the state’s Energy Efficiency Board, continue to provide significant energy and bill savings benefits to ratepayers.

C&LM program investments in 2025 alone are expected to deliver $353 million in bill savings to Connecticut ratepayers over the lifetimes of the installed efficiency measures.

In 2025, an individual Connecticut resident participating in the home energy assessment program through EnergizeCT is expected to receive an average incentive of $1,129, which will result in $2,068 average lifetime bill savings.

Overall, C&LM programs returned $2.38 in benefits for every $1 invested from 2022 to 2024. Benefits are anticipated to increase to $3.30 for every $1 invested in 2025-2027.

Modern life depends on reliable power, fuel, and interconnected systems capable of withstanding increasingly complex physical and cyber threats.

Recognizing this growing challenge, the National Governors Association (NGA), the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) convened state energy leaders, regulators, and advisors for a two-day training in Atlanta.

The event equipped participants with knowledge, partnerships, and practical tools to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions to critical energy systems, enabling states to better safeguard essential services, protect communities, and strengthen resilience against evolving risks.

Day 1

NGA’s Dan Lauf, NARUC’s Lynn Costantini, and NASEO’s Campbell Delahoyde welcomed attendees, emphasizing that critical energy infrastructure serves as the backbone for all other essential services and systems. They noted that securing these systems is becoming increasingly challenging due to their growing interconnectedness, particularly with telecommunications. Collaboration and relationship-building are vital for success, making this meeting especially important.

The program began with an overview of the physical and cyber threats facing the energy sector, focusing on nation-state actors and emerging hazards. Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations, American Gas Association, and Ryan Guest, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager, Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, encouraged attendees to monitor external threats, practice rigorous cyber hygiene, and develop comprehensive incident response playbooks for both cyber and physical threats. State-level preparedness is essential, and the best defense relies on education, trusted intelligence-sharing networks, and vigilant human oversight, especially as AI-driven attacks become more prevalent.

Campbell Delahoyde invited Sunny Wescott, Chief Meteorologist – Federal Emergency Response Official, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Joe Hagerman, Director, Mississippi Development Authority, Energy and Natural Resources Division; and Paul Holloway, Senior Energy Security and Resilience Lead, Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to discuss tools and approaches for forecasting and assessing risks to critical energy infrastructure. The energy security landscape is transforming as severe weather events become more frequent and impactful. States are moving beyond theoretical plans to actionable resilience strategies, such as Mississippi’s county-level resilience reports and Massachusetts’s integration of resilience planning into state hazard mitigation and utility grid modernization plans. These efforts ensure that assessments translate into action rather than remaining as shelf reports.

Mike Robinson, VP, Grid Transformation, Georgia Power Company, delivered a keynote address highlighting the Eastern Interconnection, “the world’s largest machine,” and the deep interconnections among water, gas, energy, and transportation systems. Disruptions in one sector can cascade across others. Robinson advocated for a comprehensive “Three P’s Framework:”

Partnerships with federal, state, and local agencies

Preparedness through risk prediction and cyber-informed engineering

Protection via infrastructure hardening

This approach has proven effective in securing major events such as the Super Bowl and the upcoming World Cup. Robinson emphasized that utilities must be recognized as embedded emergency response partners, essential for maintaining societal stability.

From physical threats to sophisticated cyber-attacks, threats to the nation’s critical energy infrastructure are growing in both scale and complexity. To discuss these issues, Dan Lauf led a panel discussion with Mike Geraghty, Chief Information Security Officer, New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC), and Ryan Guest, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager, E-ISAC. The panel stressed that effective cybersecurity information sharing begins with establishing trust through legal protections, encouraging open communication about security incidents. Proactive notification and large-scale monitoring help identify vulnerabilities before incidents occur. Organizations should monitor threat actors directly, share anonymized lessons learned, and provide actionable intelligence, including remediation guidance and indicators of compromise. Success requires breaking down organizational silos and focusing resources on actively exploited vulnerabilities in critical sectors.

As mentioned in the Keynote address, energy and other infrastructure systems are deeply interconnected. A power outage can quickly impair communications while loss of communications can hinder grid operations, emergency response, and coordination. Water is needed to cool power plants, and power is needed to operate water and wastewater systems. To explore these critical interdependencies and the importance of coordinated planning for effective response, NGA’s Phil Nichols moderated a session with:

Ollie Gagnon, Chief Homeland Security Advisor, Executive Director, Idaho National Laboratory Resilience Optimization Center

Susan Mora, Senior Director, Federal Policy and Stakeholder Relations, Exelon

Chris Boyer, VP Global Public Policy, AT&T

Jon Sparkman, Engineering Director, Tennessee American Water

The panel emphasized that effective energy security requires prioritizing consequence over threat and building resilience rather than merely preventing attacks. Mapping dependencies is complex, but establishing cross-sector relationships is the most practical strategy. The panel discussed the water-energy nexus, infrastructure theft, and the expanding attack surface from wireless and fiber systems.

Just as individuals and communities depend on state and local energy systems, so does defense critical energy infrastructure (DCEI) which plays a vital role in ensuring the readiness and resilience of national defense operations.

NGA’s Jessica Davenport invited the following panelists to provide an overview of DCEI.

Kevin Klein, Director, Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management

Kevin McElyea, Director, Office of Prevention and Security (CIAC), Colorado State Fusion Center

Megan Levy, SLTT Project Manager, Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, U.S. Department of Energy.

Mary Catherine Ott, Associate Principal for Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships, Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (OLDCC), Department of War

The session addressed unique risks from physical and cyber threats and highlighted state-federal coordination for security.

To conclude Day 1, Jenna Johnston of NGA spoke with Kristin Coulter, Communications Director, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, and Dee Anne Odom, General Manager, Alabama Power. The speakers emphasized that during disasters, the public seeks clear answers to three questions: What’s happening? What are officials doing? What should I do? Effective crisis communication requires actionable transparency, plain language, and empathy. Coordination among agencies and pre-event planning are essential for managing information demands and supporting communities during emergencies.

Sheri Haugen-Hoffart, Commissioner, North Dakota Public Service Commission, and Sam Hatcher, Executive Counsel, Office of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, opened Day 2 with a discussion on executive and regulatory authorities relevant to energy security, moderated by Dan Lauf.

Key points included the crucial role of state authorities in energy emergency response. Governors lead by declaring emergencies, which trigger coordinated statewide operations and unlock critical powers, such as lifting truck weight and hours-of-service restrictions to expedite restoration efforts.

While the executive office manages high-level decision-making, federal coordination, and National Guard deployment, regulators focus on technical oversight and utility coordination. Both are united by the principle that their primary role is to support energy companies in restoring service through clear communication and by removing barriers.

Strong coordination is essential during severe events to ensure a prompt and effective response. To explore cross-sector partnerships and highlight strategies and resources for state leaders, Megan Levy sat down with:

Russ Strickland, Secretary, Maryland Department of Emergency Management

Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations, American Gas Association

Kari Heinrich, Energy Security Lead, Wisconsin Public Service Commission

The session emphasized that effective energy security coordination depends on building relationships and establishing procedures before emergencies occur.

Success requires maintaining documented procedures and templates that persist through personnel changes, conducting comprehensive risk assessments that extend beyond internal operations to entire supply chains, and recognizing that regulatory gaps can create systemic vulnerabilities.

These challenges are even greater for remote areas and island communities, which face unique supply chain dynamics. Emerging cybersecurity threats add further complexity to energy security efforts.

To help state officials navigate intra-state and interstate coordination during energy disruptions, Jessica Davenport moderated a session with: A.J. Gary,Director, Homeland Security Advisor, Arkansas Division of Emergency Management, and Kristen Ebert,Director of Business Continuity & Crisis Response, American Electric Power (AEP).

Speakers emphasized that successful energy emergency management depends on building relationships before disasters occur, especially among state energy officials, emergency management directors, and county-level managers. They stressed that emergency requests should flow from the bottom up through proper channels, and that requestors should describe desired outcomes rather than specific resources. This approach allows emergency managers to identify the most effective and cost-efficient solutions.

When state resources are exhausted, the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) enables states to share resources. While some regions also maintain interstate agreements for faster mutual aid without requiring federal declarations.

The energy sector faces increasingly complex cybersecurity challenges that require coordinated, flexible approaches across diverse stakeholders. To address these issues, Lynn Costantini sat down with:

Sharla Artz, Security and Resilience Policy AVP, Xcel Energy

John Ransom, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Grid Security, NRECA

Matt Dale, Chief Cybersecurity Advisors, Virginia State Corporation

The panelists stressed that as an interconnected system where risk to one entity threatens all, the industry must leverage tools to filter overwhelming threat intelligence and distribute actionable mitigations.

Significant resource disparities exist, making one-size-fits-all cybersecurity requirements impractical. This necessitates risk-based, flexible approaches tailored to different utility types and architectures.

Success depends on holistic risk mitigation strategies that address cyber, physical, and environmental threats cost-effectively, as well as more frequent functional exercises to prepare for evolving threats.

In the penultimate session of the day moderator Campbell Delahoyde was joined by Jesse Sythe, E-ISAC GridEx Program Manager, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and Ben Bolton, Assistant Director, Energy Security, Emergency Preparedness & Resilience, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, for a discussion on planning and learning. Sythe shared that GridEx offers free, customizable tabletop materials that can be implemented quickly, making emergency preparedness accessible to resource-constrained entities. The distributed exercise model reveals critical insights: state-utility coordination exposed significant knowledge gaps about mutual capabilities and resource availability, while exercises consistently highlighted the need for resilient communications.",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Energy_Security_Readout_Welcome.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:59:51.754435

Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, called the plan a “comprehensive affordability package that will serve as Democrats’ roadmap on cost of living issues next year.” Thompson is the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means tax subcommittee.

Whether the package will go very far is highly uncertain. Republicans control the House, Senate and White House and passed a huge tax relief package in July.

And Democrats are not detailing how they will pay for all their proposed tax breaks, saying that will be up to the committee as it considers the legislation next year.

Tax plan is also 2026 campaign roadmap for Democrats

The plan, though, is poised to be a key campaign road map for Democrats in 2026, as Republicans continue to accuse the party of being responsible for higher prices and a sluggish economy. Democrats need a net gain of three seats next year to win a House majority.

“One year in, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have made real progress in helping working families make ends meet,” Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., Ways and Means chairman, said Thursday.

He cited new figures on prices showing a 2.7% rate of inflation over the 12 months ending in November, a slight drop from the last reading.

Thompson and his Democratic allies have long argued that the GOP tax breaks largely favor the wealthy.

Details of the Democratic plan

The House Democrats’ new American Affordability Act would include strengthening the low-income housing tax credit, provide more tax help for first-time buyers as well as renters, and including provisions to encourage conversion of vacant offices and commercial buildings into housing.

The package would include energy efficiency credits for home upgrades that help lower heating and cooling costs.

It would take steps to make electric vehicles more affordable, and invest in grid resilience, water reuse and disaster mitigation in an effort to lower long-term costs from outages and extreme weather.

Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is getting into the fusion power business through a $6 billion merger of his social media firm and Google-backed TAE Technologies, announced just days after industry leaders met with U.S. Energy Department representatives to urge federal funding.

The all-stock deal ​announced on Thursday is an ambitious bet on the power boom spurred by artificial intelligence data-centers and adds to the Trump family's growing roster of diverse ventures ‌from cryptocurrency to real estate holdings and mobile services.

After his return to office this year, Trump's close relatives have pursued ventures leveraging his political power and policy shifts. The Trump family has, for instance, amassed billions in crypto-related ‌wealth as Trump throws his support behind digital financial assets. Greater support from the federal government could potentially boost the value of this investment, as well.

The news put a charge into shares of the money-losing Trump Media on Thursday, sending them up 35%. The stock, popular with retail traders, had lost more than 70% of its value over the last 12 months following a big surge during the 2024 campaign.

""At face value, this is a Barbenheimer mashup. Trump Media gets a dramatic new growth story tied to the AI power crunch and data-center (hyperscaler) electricity demand, while TAE gets ⁠a fast lane to being publicly traded via an all stock ‌merger valued above $6 billion,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.

EFFORTS IN FUSION

The growing electricity needs of the technology industry have in recent months revived interest in nuclear power, including restarting fully shuttered reactors, expanding existing plants and signing contracts for future small ‍modular reactors.

Despite decades of global efforts, nuclear fusion, often seen as a cleaner and reliable power source, has yet to produce a commercially viable reactor.

Shareholders of both companies will own about 50% of the combined entity after the deal closes in mid-2026. Trump Media and Technology Group will be the holding company for businesses including Truth Social platform, TAE Power Solutions, and TAE Life Sciences.

Trump has 114 million shares ​in Trump Media, roughly 40% of the company. In the new merger, his ownership stake would be roughly 20%. The company, which mainly generates revenue from advertising on the ‌Truth Social platform, has consistently clocked losses since its inception, including a loss of $54.8 million in its September-end quarter.

Thursday's rally was a salve for some retail investors who have watched the stock's price fizzle for most of 2025. Chad Nedohin, an Edmonton-based pastor and mechanical engineer in the energy sector, leads one of the largest Trump Media retail investor groups on Truth Social, which has more than 190,000 followers.

Up until the past year, Nedohin had been one of Truth Social’s most influential hype men - but has been frustrated as the stock slumped all year. “I can’t sit here and just be excited about a stock that’s done nothing but stupid stuff until today,"" he said. ""But today was awesome, I think it’s a brilliant move.”

WAVE OF THE FUTURE?

Companies ⁠and physicists at national laboratories have been trying for decades to foster fusion reactions, in which light ​atoms are forced together under extreme temperatures to release huge amounts of energy, a process that fuels the sun.

Big ​hurdles to commercialize fusion include getting more energy out of a reaction than what goes into it and developing plants that can withstand streams of fusion reactions to power the grid.

TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer and other fusion company leaders met with U.S. Energy Department officials this month, weeks after the ‍department formed its first ever fusion office.

Trump Media ⁠agreed to provide up to $200 million in cash to TAE at signing and $100 million more upon initial filing of the registration. The deal has been approved by the companies' boards.

The companies plan to build the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant beginning next year. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a brief, eight-minute investor call ⁠that the companies plan to ""quickly seek approvals"" after the deal closes, with siting for the plant expected to begin by 2026 end.

He will be co-CEO of the new company, along with Binderbauer. The two, along with Donald ‌Trump Jr., will sit on the merged company's board.

The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – is on track to release a draft environmental review by early January with a range of options to replace the river’s operating rules, which are set to expire at the end of 2026.

Several elements of the draft were shared during the annual Colorado River Water Users Association’s conference in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace Wednesday.

Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules will be required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.

Interior Department Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, Andrea Travnicek, said the agency is committed to meeting the self-imposed January deadline in order to finalize new rules before the current ones expire.

“The Department of the Interior recognizes a shrinking timeline is in front of us in order to operate under a new potential agreement,” Travnicek said.

In an unusual move, federal water officials said the draft will not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer, which is typically included in environmental reviews.

“We will not be identifying a preferred alternative, but we anticipate the identification of that between the draft and the final,” said Bureau of Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, Carly Jerla.

Instead, the draft environmental review will list a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply.

“We want to continue to facilitate, but not dictate these operations. The goal here is to inform decision makers and encourage parties to adopt agreements that put consultation and negotiation first,” Jerla continued.

Lower Basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — have been at an impasse for months over how to manage the Colorado River’s shrinking water supplies.

Last month, the states missed a federally-imposed deadline to submit a preliminary seven-state consensus plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines after days of intense closed-door negotiations.

States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.

The Bureau of Reclamation’s Acting Commissioner Scott Cameron said he and other federal officials have intensified efforts to bring states to a consensus, flying out West every other week since early April to meet with the seven states’ river negotiators.

“There are a number of issues from decades past that some people are having some difficulty getting past,” Cameron said, adding that states must “be willing to set aside previous perceived inequities and unfairness.”

One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.

Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.

Despite states missing past deadlines, Cameron said he was “cautiously optimistic” states will reach a consensus deal by the February deadline.

“It’s not unusual in the negotiating process that tougher decisions get made the closer you get to the deadline. And frankly, there are tough decisions that have to be made,” Cameron said.

On Tuesday, California’s biggest water districts said they were willing to “set aside many of their legal positions” in order to reach a seven-state agreement.

The Bureau of Reclamation provided a broad overview of the components that will be included in draft’s range of options, including guidelines to reduce water deliveries from Lake Mead during shortages, coordinated reservoir operations for Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and storage and delivery mechanisms for conserved water.

Jerla, Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, said the draft alternatives will include some components previously proposed by states.

She said the agency has adopted a number of temporary operational agreements since 2008 to address changing conditions on the river. Those agreements have served as test runs for a long term agreement and emphasized the need for more flexibility when managing the river from year-to-year.

“We want to preserve ourselves the flexibility to come back to the table, to do reviews, to make consensus adjustments if needed,” Jerla said.

That flexibility to operations will likely be needed again this year due to a less-than-average upcoming snow season, that combined with a dry spring or early summer in 2026, could create conditions for another low runoff year.

“We’re monitoring the forecast, and we’re seeing not a great start to water year 2026. It’s still early in the year, but the way things are setting up it isn’t looking good,” Jerla said.

The two biggest reservoirs in the country, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are currently at a fraction of their full capacity. Lake Mead is at 32% capacity, while Lake Powell is at 28%.

Additionally, water inflow into the reservoirs in 2026 are projected to most likely be 75% of the average, according to the federal agency. The minimum probable inflow forecast for 2026 is 44% of average, indicating a potentially very dry year.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dsc08945-1024x6831766078804.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=4IhLNUN6,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:25.631818

It’s time to pass the SPEED Act and protect America’s future.","WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman published an op-ed in the Washington Times highlighting the importance of the SPEED Act, legislation that will simplify and streamline America’s overly burdensome permitting process. The legislation will allow America to start building again, which will create new jobs, reduce costs, and unleash American energy. Read the full op-ed below or here(link is external).

The SPEED Act: Helping America build again

The economy(link is external) today faces a large but, thankfully, simple problem. Our demand for energy(link is external) is rising faster than our ability to generate it. The solution is also simple: build more infrastructure(link is external) — more power plants, more roads, and pipelines — so we can produce more energy.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it clear that energy dominance is a priority. The private sector is ready to invest billions in energy abundance, and workers are ready to break ground on next-generation infrastructure. Unfortunately, for decades now, shovel-ready projects across the country have been routinely stalled and even strangled by our antiquated federal permitting system.

As AI data centers and reshored manufacturing drive demand higher, Congress has to decide whether the next decade brings the United States an energy crisis or global energy dominance. Permitting reform — specifically the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act — is a generational opportunity to deliver higher wages and real affordability for working families.

At the heart of permitting dysfunction today is the National Environmental Policy Act. Passed in 1969, NEPA used to require federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of any new government construction project. But five decades of bureaucratic mission creep and agenda-driven lawsuits have twisted the original, sensible law into a black hole of costly red tape.

For construction workers to law professors to small business owners, the very word “NEPA” is today more synonymous with waste and abuse than environmental protection. Consider that the average NEPA Environmental Impact Statement from 2013 to 2018 totaled 575 pages and took nearly five years to complete. A quarter of them took six years or more. These delays cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars.

And even when reviews do get completed, approved projects face a gauntlet of expensive, time-consuming lawsuits. NEPA is the nation’s most litigated and frivolously litigated environmental statute. According to research by the Breakthrough Institute, it takes an average of more than four years to resolve legal challenges after publication of NEPA environmental review documents. And where do these lawsuits come from? Ten extremist environmentalist groups are responsible for 35% of all NEPA lawsuits.

The scrapped Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a textbook case. It was a 600-mile, $8 billion project, initially approved in 2015 to deliver affordable natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. By the time the project was abandoned in 2020, NEPA had delayed it 894 days, and litigation another 570 days. Billions of dollars’ worth of affordable and reliable energy for one of the fastest-growing regions of the country was lost. And all the jobs, economic development, and tax revenue that went with it disappeared in a tsunami of legal fees and broken promises.

These aren’t failures of planning or engineering. They are failures of policy. And in 2025, the federal government’s tolerance for NEPA’s red tape is becoming existential. If the U.S. cannot build energy and mineral infrastructure, China will surpass us in AI technology — for both civilian and military applications. That would have disastrous economic and strategic consequences for America and our allies. If, due to our policy failures, we cede global leadership to China, America would become a less safe, less affordable, and less free country.

A generation from now, we cannot tell our children that a heavily abused permitting process contributed to losing the AI arms race. If Congress passes the SPEED Act, we won’t have to.

The bill, scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives this week, fixes several of NEPA’s systemic problems by restoring the law to its original purpose: a procedural review for proposed projects.

The SPEED Act would restrict NEPA lawsuits to parties actually affected by a project and establish reasonable filing deadlines.

It would codify key elements of the Supreme Court’s Seven County decision, clarifying judicial review in NEPA cases. It would align judicial remedies with the fact that NEPA is, after all, a procedural statute, not a progress impediment.

Finally, the SPEED Act would reaffirm the scope of NEPA reviews as they were initially intended.

The SPEED Act would establish clear rules and a level playing field for federal projects across all agencies and industries. It enjoys bipartisan sponsorship in the House and support from over 300 NEPA-adjacent industries and organizations.

NEPA was originally written to facilitate thoughtful growth, not reckless obstruction. The SPEED Act restores its proper function and will finally empower the people to build. The challenges we face demand that we act. It’s time to pass the SPEED Act and protect America’s future.",https://scalise.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:18.772615

From expanding apprenticeship programs to strengthening career pathways, state leaders took decisive action to address workforce shortages, promote economic mobility and prepare workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Governors and their staff also convened regularly to share best practices and forged new partnerships to ensure their workforce systems remain responsive to both employer needs and worker aspirations.

Strengthening Workforce Programs and Systems

Governors invested significant effort in maximizing federal workforce programs that connect job seekers with training, supportive services and employment opportunities. From SNAP E&T to WIOA administration, state leaders worked to make these systems more effective, accessible and responsive to evolving labor market needs.

Transforming Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Systems

In April 2025, NGA released Governors Reshaping Workforce Development: Turning WIOA Challenges into Workforce Solutions, a comprehensive report examining how Governors leverage their authority under WIOA to design, fund and implement effective workforce development strategies. The research, conducted in partnership with the Harvard Project on Workforce, included in-depth interviews with Governors’ policy advisors in 34 states and technical surveys of workforce administrators in 17 states.

Five Major Trends Identified:

States shifting organizational structures to improve workforce governance, with some creating offices within the Governor’s executive office to coordinate policy

States adopting stakeholder-driven approaches to WIOA planning, integrating it into broader economic development strategies

Significant investment in workforce services for high-growth sectors including clean energy, semiconductor manufacturing, broadband and healthcare

Creative funding solutions to address WIOA limitations, including braiding multiple funding sources and using Governor’s Reserve Funds for innovation

Expansion of training programs and supportive services, with over 80 percent of advisors mentioning youth workforce pipeline initiatives

A congressional briefing on the whitepaper brought together state leaders from Arizona and Tennessee to share their innovative approaches with federal policymakers, emphasizing the need for greater flexibility and sustained funding for workforce systems.

SNAP Employment and Training Innovation

The NGA Center, in partnership with Third Sector Capital Partners, launched a Policy Academy to Strengthen SNAP Employment & Training Delivery in 2024 to support state teams in enacting policy and programmatic changes to improve SNAP E&T delivery and enhance participants’ economic wellbeing. In May 2025, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina were selected to participate in the 2025-2026 cohort. These states received targeted technical assistance to identify and overcome obstacles that hinder effective SNAP E&T implementation. By facilitating coordination between Governors’ offices and key workforce and human services agencies, this policy academy will help states unlock opportunities for SNAP recipients to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

Preparing for Workforce Pell Implementation

Recognizing the transformative potential of expanding federal Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs, NGA launched a Readiness Academy to Support Workforce Pell Implementation. This national project, supported by JPMorgan Chase and developed in partnership with the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, helps states navigate the policy, operational, and strategic choices necessary to make this new funding stream successful. The initiative offers states access to an aligned ecosystem of national support, opportunities to connect with peers, tailored guidance and tools, and a central hub for reliable information from experts and federal partners.

Key Convenings and Policy Institutes

Throughout 2025, NGA convened state workforce leaders for invaluable opportunities for peer learning, federal engagement and the development of innovative solutions to shared challenges.

2025 Winter Workforce Development Policy Institute

The 2025 Winter Workforce Development Policy Institute, held March 12-14 in Washington, D.C., brought together Governors’ workforce development policy advisors, state agency leaders and workforce board chairs from across the nation. The comprehensive three-day program addressed critical topics including disaster response, AI-powered workforce tools, military and veteran career pathways, and performance metrics.

A comprehensive commentary on state and territorial workforce development successes highlighted five major themes emerging from rapid-fire state presentations at the Winter Institute:

Expanding apprenticeship programs for teachers, construction workers, and positions in advanced manufacturing, healthcare, IT and finance

Utilizing AI and innovative technology for workforce service delivery through online career tools and case management systems

Advancing data and accountability systems to track progress toward measurable goals

Implementing strategies to increase labor force participation by addressing barriers like childcare, transportation and housing

Improving workforce system governance through reorganization and better alignment with education systems

Montana Convening: AI and Economic Opportunity

In August 2025, NGA convened state workforce leaders in Montana for the Biannual Workforce Development Policy Institute. Held in Billings August 13-15, this gathering brought together leaders from 37 states and territories to discuss workforce innovation, AI integration and pathways to work.

At the event, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte highlighted his newly-launched 406 JOBS initiative, a unifying framework designed to create four pathways to employment and zero barriers to work, focused on six high-demand sectors. The Institute featured sessions on AI’s impact on the future of work, including presentations from OpenAI’s Chief Economist Dr. Ronnie Chatterji and Pennsylvania’s Director of Digital Strategy Annie Newman, who discussed the state’s pilot program integrating ChatGPT into public sector employee workflows.

Targeted Policy Academies and Initiatives

Throughout 2025, NGA launched and continued several focused policy academies designed to help states develop and implement specific workforce strategies aligned with their Governors’ priorities.

Youth Apprenticeship Expansion

As a national partner in the Partnership to Advance Youth Apprenticeship, NGA launched a Policy Academy to Advance Youth Apprenticeship to help states develop high-quality youth apprenticeship opportunities. Maryland, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington were selected to participate in this yearlong initiative.

Service-to-Career Pathways

In partnership with the Schultz Family Foundation and Annie E. Casey Foundation, NGA selected six states for a Service-to-Career Pathways Policy Academy: Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Vermont. Utah Governor Spencer Cox and Maryland Governor Wes Moore co-chair an Advisory Board providing strategic guidance for the initiative.

The initiative gained momentum with a convening in Salt Lake City, Utah that brought together leaders from 24 states to showcase best practices. Governor Cox kicked off the summit highlighting Utah’s innovative One Utah Service Fellowship and employee service requirements for companies receiving state economic development incentives. Attendees also visited Olympus High School to observe Utah’s Volunteer for Good pilot program in action.

State Government as Model Employer for People with Disabilities

In May 2025, NGA released State Government as a Model Employer for People with Disabilities: A Playbook for Governors, a comprehensive guide highlighting six actionable strategies Governors can use to improve state government career paths for people with disabilities. With state governments employing more than 5.5 million workers nationwide, positioning states as model employers for people with disabilities represents a powerful solution to address both workforce shortages and promote economic inclusion.

Looking Ahead

From expanding apprenticeships, strengthening service pathways, and preparing workers for emerging industries, Governors continue to demonstrate remarkable innovation and a strong commitment to economic mobility.

The work of 2025 demonstrated that when Governors lead with vision, invest in evidence-based strategies, and commit to cross-state collaboration, transformative change becomes possible. The foundations laid this year will continue supporting economic opportunity, workforce readiness, and community prosperity for years to come.",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AdobeStock_1535082983-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:07.254512

Subcommittee Chairman Palmer’s opening statement as prepared for delivery:

“Welcome to today’s hearing before the Subcommittee on Environment. This year, we’ve revisited some of our country’s most important environmental laws and confronted emerging challenges in protecting our environment and promoted a regulatory climate that encourages innovation and economic growth.

“Among other things, we’ve identified shortcomings with the administration of the Toxic Substances Control Act that delay newer, safer chemistries from reaching consumers; explored opportunities to revitalize brownfields sites for crucial infrastructure projects; evaluated the state of technologies to improve our recycling systems; and passed common-sense Clear Air Act reforms.

“Today, we are examining EPA’s decision last year to designate two PFAS chemistries—PFOA and PFOS—as hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as ‘CERCLA’ or the Superfund law. CERLCA was enacted in 1980 to facilitate the cleanup of the most contaminated sites around the country and to establish a scheme to hold liable for cleanup costs the parties responsible for that contamination. Superfund imposes strict, and joint and several liability on parties.

“In other words, a responsible party could be responsible for the entire cost to cleanup a contaminated site even if its contribution to the pollution was minimal. CERCLA includes exemptions as well as defenses to liability for certain parties such as ‘bona fide prospective purchasers’ and ‘innocent landowners,’ as they are referred to. However, in the context of the hazardous substance designations for PFOA and PFOS, there are concerns that the existing exemptions and defenses may not adequately protect a class of parties commonly known as ‘passive receivers’ who did not manufacture or use PFOA or PFOS, but may have acquired, used, or disposed of material containing these chemicals. Today, we will examine the impacts of potential liability for PFAS contamination on these entities. Congress has clarified and expanded liability protections before, such as by passing the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act in 2002. We will consider how concerns about PFAS liability may deter a range of economic activities and whether changes to CERCLA, or other legislative action, are needed.

“Additionally, at our March hearing on reauthorization of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Brownfields Program, we discussed the tremendous potential of the estimated 450,000 brownfields sites in our country for housing important infrastructure such as power generation, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and data centers.

“We hope to examine whether concerns about liability for PFAS hinder the redevelopment of these sites.

“To this end, we welcome Susan Bodine, who previously served as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response at EPA during the George W. Bush Administration and then as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance in the first Trump Administration, in addition to senior staff roles in both the House and the Senate.

“We are also joined by Lawrence Falbe, Chair of the International Council of Shopping Centers Environmental and Land Use Policy Committee. Mr. Falbe will share his experience on how potential PFAS contamination impacts real estate transactions for those seeking to reuse those sites.

“Next, Emily Donovan joins us a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, a grassroots community advocacy organization focused on the presence and impact of certain PFAS in communities. We also welcome Tracy Mehan, who represents the American Water Works Association and served as EPA Assistant Administrator for Water, also during the George W. Bush Administration. I thank all of our Members and witnesses for being here, and I look forward to today’s discussion.”

The biggest reason EV prices remain high in Canada is insufficient supply, especially of affordable models. Automakers prioritize markets like California, China, and the European Union where strong regulations require them to sell EVs, and without an EVAS, Canada is treated as a lower-priority market. This limited supply drives up prices and wait times, leads carmakers to focus on large, high-profit luxury models instead of affordable ones, and results in a very small used-EV market because new EV availability has been restricted for years.

Although the good news is that EVs are already effectively cheaper over their lifetime due to major savings on fuel and maintenance, most buyers focus on the sticker price instead of long-term costs. Carmakers are not helping either, as many have phased out affordable models such as the Chevy Bolt while shifting toward expensive luxury EVs. Meanwhile, manufacturers like BYD in China are already selling fully electric vehicles for the equivalent of $14,000 CAD.

The reality is that EVs can be affordable, but traditional automakers often prefer to sell high-profit gasoline trucks and SUVs, which now make up eight out of ten new vehicles sold in Canada and have contributed to Canada having the worst on-road vehicle emissions profile in the world. Incentives alone cannot fix this problem, since automakers frequently respond by raising EV prices so they get a portion of the subsidy.

A strong EV Availability Standard directly addresses these issues by requiring automakers to supply more EVs, including affordable models, to the Canadian market. Regulation that forces a shift to 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035 will push companies to scale production, invest in cost-reducing technology, and bring lower-priced models to Canada, ultimately cutting EV prices by about 20 percent on average and making them far more accessible for consumers.

Will there be enough charging infrastructure?

Canada must expand charging infrastructure, and we are. Thousands of public chargers are being built across the country with federal, provincial, municipal, and private investment. But public charging is only one part of the picture.

Most charging happens at home or at work. Public chargers matter most for long-distance travel, communities without garages or driveways, and equitable access. Charging gaps exist but they’re solvable.

Carmakers claim that without more existing charging infrastructure we will not be able to meet our EV target. Evidence shows that this is false. Our 2023 Report with our partners, shows that expanding public charging universally increases EV market share by only about 1.5%. With the EVAS in place, this number increases significantly. Supply, not charging, is the primary bottleneck.

A strong EVAS improves charging by creating predictable EV demand that attracts private investment. The policy allows automakers to earn compliance credits by funding charging infrastructure, and supporting municipal policies that encourage the installation of charging stations.

Are EV batteries bad for the environment? What about mining?

EV batteries do have environmental impacts, particularly related to mining and manufacturing, but these impacts are significantly smaller than the ongoing damage caused by extracting, refining, and burning fossil fuels. The environmental footprint of gasoline and diesel production is enormous, involving large-scale land destruction, air and water pollution, and the release of billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. In comparison, the materials required for EV batteries are far more limited, and as battery recycling expands, the demand for new mining will continue to decline.

Mining for minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt must be managed responsibly. Environmental Defence supports strong protections for Indigenous rights and local communities, the exclusion of mining from ecologically sensitive areas such as peatlands, and the enforcement of high labour and environmental standards across global supply chains. Ethical sourcing and certification systems can ensure that mining avoids the abuses that have occurred in some parts of the world. It is also important to recognize that the scale of mining required for EVs is small compared to the vast quantities of coal, oil, and gas extracted each year. Unlike fossil fuels, minerals used for batteries can be reused or recovered, which means the need for new mining diminishes over time as recycling systems grow.

Battery manufacturing can be carbon intensive in countries that rely heavily on coal, but this impact is already shrinking. Canada is rapidly expanding EV and battery manufacturing using a much cleaner electricity grid, which reduces the carbon footprint of production. Companies are developing new battery chemistries that use less energy to produce and incorporate more recycled materials. Policies can further reduce emissions by requiring responsible sourcing, cleaner manufacturing processes, and higher recycled content in batteries, all of which strengthen the environmental benefits of EVs.

At the end of their life, EV batteries are not sent to landfills. They can be repurposed for stationary energy storage, where they continue to provide valuable service for many years. Once no longer suitable for reuse, batteries are recycled to recover valuable minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. This reduces the need for new mining and supports the development of a circular battery economy. Canada is becoming a leader in battery recycling technologies, with new facilities capable of extracting and reusing most of the materials in old batteries.

When all stages are considered, EVs provide a large net environmental benefit. They eliminate tailpipe emissions, dramatically reduce air pollution, and produce far fewer greenhouse gases over their lifetime compared to gasoline vehicles. As Canada’s electricity grid gets cleaner, the environmental advantages of EVs will grow even stronger, while fossil fuel vehicles will continue to pollute every kilometre they are driven.

Will EVs lead to job losses?

No. The transition presents one of the largest economic opportunities in modern Canadian history.

Canada’s auto industry, long centered on the production of gas and diesel vehicles, has stagnated in recent years while global electric vehicle manufacturing is accelerating. With the right policy support, Electric Mobility Canada estimates that up to 600,000 jobs could be created in the e-mobility sector by 2035, a transformative opportunity for a sector in need of renewal.

Despite claims from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle manufacturers that the EVAS threatens their survival, evidence suggests otherwise. Research by Équiterre, Environmental Defence and the David Suzuki Foundation shows that even under a stringent EVAS, the industry’s annual profits are projected to rise by 24 per cent between 2023 and 2035.

How far can EVs travel? Is range still a concern?

Range has increased dramatically and continues to improve. The average range of new battery-electric vehicles rose from under 120 km in 2010 to 349 km in 2021, and many current models exceed 400–500 km.

Most Canadians drive less than 50 kilometres per day, which is well below the range of even modest EVs. While range decreases somewhat in winter, it returns in warmer weather. Public fast chargers also support long-distance travel.

Once drivers switch to EVs, range anxiety typically fades. Surveys consistently show high satisfaction with range and winter performance.

What about public transit? Won’t more EVs lead to more congestion and cars on the road?

Electric vehicles are an important tool for reducing emissions, but they are not a complete solution to transportation challenges such as congestion, car dependence, or urban sprawl. We agree that truly sustainable cities cannot rely on every individual owning a personal vehicle. However, it is also true that many Canadians still need cars today, particularly in suburban and rural areas where public transit is limited or nonexistent. In this context, it is essential that people who must rely on cars have access to cleaner options. High costs and limited availability should not prevent Canadians from choosing electric vehicles, especially since Canada currently has one of the most polluting passenger vehicle fleets in the world.

At the same time, improving and expanding public transit is critical. Investments in frequent, reliable, and affordable transit provide real alternatives to driving, especially in denser urban areas. Better transit service, integrated with active transportation networks, helps reduce congestion, lowers emissions, and improves access to jobs and services. Urban design plays a major role as well. Walkable neighbourhoods, protected bike lanes, and infrastructure for e-bikes and other micro-mobility options make it possible for people to replace short car trips with healthier, lower-carbon choices. This is especially important given that the majority of trips in North America are under ten kilometers, distances that can easily be covered by transit, walking, or cycling if the infrastructure is in place.

For the millions of Canadians who still rely on cars because of where they live or work, EVs remain a valuable transitional tool. They significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from necessary trips and help improve air quality in communities, especially along busy corridors. As cities invest in transit and build more complete, walkable neighbourhoods, the demand for personal vehicles can decline over time. But during this transition, ensuring access to affordable electric vehicles helps reduce emissions from the trips that cannot yet be shifted to other modes.

The most sustainable path forward combines EV adoption for trips that genuinely require a car, strong public transit for longer journeys, and active transportation for short daily travel. It also includes smarter land-use planning that reduces overall travel demand. EVs are necessary, but not sufficient on their own. The long-term goal must be a transportation system that gives people real choices, reduces car dependence, and supports healthier, low-carbon communities.

Why don’t we look at incentives rather than regulations?

We support incentives for the purposes of industrial policy, like the United States implemented under Biden by tying eligibility to having the vehicle made in North America.

However, there are several reasons why purchase incentives are less effective than the EVAS at driving EV sales:

When automakers have their EV sales subsidized, they raise the price of EVs to capture a portion of the incentive instead of lowering the price for you. They then use those subsidies to reduce prices on gas cars.

The automaker’s current recommendations are to triple incentives. This costs the federal government more than $54 billion. While the EV standard costs taxpayers nothing.

Finally, in most cases, incentives financially benefit people who would buy an electric car anyways, regardless of whether the subsidy exists or not.

One interesting case is that China has increasingly shifted away from purchase incentives as their primary driver for EV sales and instead focused more on regulations. Since 2011, the average retail price for an EV in China has decreased by 47%, while it has increased by 28% in Europe and 38% in the United States.

Comprehensive research regarding the transition to electric vehicles and how the auto industry is fighting against clean car regulations is included in our recent report, Profiting from Pollution.

What about hydrogen or other alternative fuels?

We will not solve transportation emissions with hydrogen cars. First of all, hydrogen fuel cell technology in cars is not commercially ready to scale up fast like battery-electric cars are, in the short window of time we have to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Secondly, passenger transportation is not appropriate for hydrogen because the technology is too costly and inefficient compared to battery-electric alternatives. For example, to drive the same number of kilometers, the amount of renewable energy needed for a fuel cell vehicle is double what is needed for a battery electric vehicle. Third, most hydrogen created today is not actually green, but in fact created by a carbon intensive process using natural gas (methane) – a fossil fuel.

Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels have been proposed by auto industry lobbyists as a false solution in response to efforts to require the phase out of gas vehicles. E-fuels are made through an expensive process which turns electricity into hydrogen and combined with CO2 to create a liquid fuel that could be pumped in a regular gas car. Put simply, this is just a tactic to keep gasoline cars on the road because no technology exists that would prevent someone from filling up a car with gasoline instead of e-fuels.

Trying to decarbonize cars with e-fuels is like showering with champagne – it would be 43 per cent more expensive for an average driver to fill up with e-fuels instead of gas. E-fuels are also in very short supply, one analysis found that there will only be enough e-fuel in Europe to power 2 per cent of the car fleet by 2035. Trying to use e-fuels in cars takes it away from other applications where it may actually be necessary, such as air travel. This makes it a distraction from real solutions.

Conclusion

Electric vehicles are cleaner, cheaper to operate, and increasingly practical for drivers in every region of Canada—from major cities to rural communities. The main barrier is not technology or infrastructure; it is the lack of strong policy requiring automakers to make EVs available and affordable to Canadians.

A strong Electric Vehicle Availability Standard is essential to unlocking EV supply, improving affordability, and ensuring Canada doesn’t fall further behind other countries in the global clean transportation transition.",https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/winter-EV.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 12:59:09.890357

The legislation will allow America to start building again, which will create new jobs, reduce costs, and unleash American energy. Read the full op-ed below or here.

The SPEED Act: Helping America build again

The economy today faces a large but, thankfully, simple problem. Our demand for energy is rising faster than our ability to generate it. The solution is also simple: build more infrastructure — more power plants, more roads, and pipelines — so we can produce more energy.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it clear that energy dominance is a priority. The private sector is ready to invest billions in energy abundance, and workers are ready to break ground on next-generation infrastructure. Unfortunately, for decades now, shovel-ready projects across the country have been routinely stalled and even strangled by our antiquated federal permitting system.

As AI data centers and reshored manufacturing drive demand higher, Congress has to decide whether the next decade brings the United States an energy crisis or global energy dominance. Permitting reform — specifically the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act — is a generational opportunity to deliver higher wages and real affordability for working families.

At the heart of permitting dysfunction today is the National Environmental Policy Act. Passed in 1969, NEPA used to require federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of any new government construction project. But five decades of bureaucratic mission creep and agenda-driven lawsuits have twisted the original, sensible law into a black hole of costly red tape.

For construction workers to law professors to small business owners, the very word “NEPA” is today more synonymous with waste and abuse than environmental protection. Consider that the average NEPA Environmental Impact Statement from 2013 to 2018 totaled 575 pages and took nearly five years to complete. A quarter of them took six years or more. These delays cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars.

And even when reviews do get completed, approved projects face a gauntlet of expensive, time-consuming lawsuits. NEPA is the nation’s most litigated and frivolously litigated environmental statute. According to research by the Breakthrough Institute, it takes an average of more than four years to resolve legal challenges after publication of NEPA environmental review documents. And where do these lawsuits come from? Ten extremist environmentalist groups are responsible for 35% of all NEPA lawsuits.

The scrapped Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a textbook case. It was a 600-mile, $8 billion project, initially approved in 2015 to deliver affordable natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. By the time the project was abandoned in 2020, NEPA had delayed it 894 days, and litigation another 570 days. Billions of dollars’ worth of affordable and reliable energy for one of the fastest-growing regions of the country was lost. And all the jobs, economic development, and tax revenue that went with it disappeared in a tsunami of legal fees and broken promises.

These aren’t failures of planning or engineering. They are failures of policy. And in 2025, the federal government’s tolerance for NEPA’s red tape is becoming existential. If the U.S. cannot build energy and mineral infrastructure, China will surpass us in AI technology — for both civilian and military applications. That would have disastrous economic and strategic consequences for America and our allies. If, due to our policy failures, we cede global leadership to China, America would become a less safe, less affordable, and less free country.

A generation from now, we cannot tell our children that a heavily abused permitting process contributed to losing the AI arms race. If Congress passes the SPEED Act, we won’t have to.

The bill, scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives this week, fixes several of NEPA’s systemic problems by restoring the law to its original purpose: a procedural review for proposed projects.

The SPEED Act would restrict NEPA lawsuits to parties actually affected by a project and establish reasonable filing deadlines.

It would codify key elements of the Supreme Court’s Seven County decision, clarifying judicial review in NEPA cases. It would align judicial remedies with the fact that NEPA is, after all, a procedural statute, not a progress impediment.

Finally, the SPEED Act would reaffirm the scope of NEPA reviews as they were initially intended.

The SPEED Act would establish clear rules and a level playing field for federal projects across all agencies and industries. It enjoys bipartisan sponsorship in the House and support from over 300 NEPA-adjacent industries and organizations.

NEPA was originally written to facilitate thoughtful growth, not reckless obstruction. The SPEED Act restores its proper function and will finally empower the people to build. The challenges we face demand that we act. It’s time to pass the SPEED Act and protect America’s future.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed yesterday to vacate and rehear a September panel ruling allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to freeze $20 billion in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants.

“Earlier in the year, EPA Administrator [Lee] Zeldin proudly terminated $20 billion in GGRF funding that was awarded to eight National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator entities as serious concerns were raised regarding self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and reduced government oversight,” an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “EPA looks forward to vindicating its rights in court.”

“A court just said the EPA must stop blocking the investments from our Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., posted on social media. “We created this program to support innovation that spurs good-paying jobs & lowers costs for Americans.”

Dive Insight:

Climate United received $6.97 billion in grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in April 2024.

The organization used the money to fund “projects across the United States that support domestic clean energy development, build healthy and affordable housing, accelerate American-made electric vehicle manufacturing, and save hard-working Americans money on their bills,” it said in a March 8 lawsuit filed after EPA froze the funding to it and other organizations on March 4.

The EPA stated that the grants were terminated “based on substantial concerns regarding the GGRF program integrity, the award process, wasteful spending, and misalignment with agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a preliminary injunction rejecting the EPA’s attempts to terminate the grant program on April 15.

EPA appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 in September that the district court lacked jurisdiction in the case. Climate United and a group of grantees filed an emergency appeal asking the full court to review that decision on Sept. 11.

Armed men snatched immigrants from front yards, parking lots and work sites, pulled them from cars and threw some to the ground. Anxiety spiked for many of Mecklenburg County’s 175,000 Hispanic residents. Businesses closed. Students stayed home. People who needed medical help were afraid to get it.

Prieto, 71, a naturalized citizen from Colombia, did something he’d never done. “I carried my passport in my pocket for the first time ever,” he said. “These (agents) didn’t respect anyone or anything.”

“Operation Charlotte’s Web” disrupted lives and families and raised concerns throughout the community. It made national headlines. It’s just one of many Trump administration policies that have impacted people here.

Roughly a year into the second Trump administration, changes have frayed federal safety nets and upended practices once taken for granted. They’ve affected housing, health care, food security and education. New policies have impacted how people live and, in at least one case, where they live.

“We need to acknowledge the attack that we’re under and do what we can to support our nonprofit service providers, who are meeting increased need with fewer resources,” said Kathryn Firmin-Sellers, president and CEO of United Way of Greater Charlotte.

The effects aren’t hard to find. Mecklenburg County health officials had to lay off people working to slow the spread of HIV. Housing advocates are scrambling to ensure that people who get federal housing aid don’t lose it. Food banks are coping with the loss of one federal assistance program and cuts to another.

“Ultimately our super-hero cape is not big enough to shoulder the crisis that the federal government has created,” said Tina Postel, CEO of Nourish Up, a local food pantry.

Border Patrol officials said they went after “the worst of the worst,” though offered no proof for most of the more than 400 people detained in Mecklenburg. But the arrest last week by police of an undocumented immigrant for allegedly stabbing a light rail passenger reignited concerns among some – including President Donald Trump.

Some say the federal budget cuts reflect spending constraints as well as philosophical differences in the role of the federal government.

“It may just be a differing view of what the federal government should do going forward,” said Republican Tariq Bokhari, a former Charlotte City Council member who briefly served as deputy administrator of the Federal Transit Administration.

The cuts in federal spending have come at a time when some nonprofits have seen private philanthropic and charitable gifts decline. Tracy Russ, a senior vice president of the Foundation for the Carolinas, calls it a kind of “double whammy” that he expects to get worse.

“What I’m most fearful of is what these impacts look like a year or two from now,” he said.

For many service providers, the “double whammy” comes at a fraught time. With inflation up 25% since 2020, more families are squeezed.

“The need has never been greater in the 50-year history of Crisis Assistance Ministry,” said Carol Hardison, its longtime CEO.

New rules could displace hundreds in Mecklenburg County

Karen Pelletier, director of the county’s Housing Innovation & Stabilization Services, remembers how she felt when she saw November’s email from federal housing officials.

“Helpless and concerned,” she recalls.

The email confirmed that the federal government was making a major change in housing policy by essentially ending Housing First. That program is based on the notion that housing should be a prerequisite for people dealing with addictions or mental illness, not a reward for overcoming them. Advocates say it’s got a track record of success in getting people off the streets and under roofs.

“All the research will tell you that Housing First is the appropriate course of action,” said Firmin-Sellers. “The model is that you get people into Housing First and then you provide the wraparound supports to help them stay there.”

The new policy would enact work requirements and require – not just encourage – addiction or mental health treatment. Federal aid would be temporary and designed to help people transition to private housing. The New York Times called the policy shift “the most consequential in a generation.”

“That completely erases the 10 years of success that we’ve had in Housing First,” Pelletier said.

Devon Kurtz of the conservative Cicero Institute told the New York Times that, “Housing First simultaneously expected too much of people, by assuming everyone was ready for housing, and too little, in terms of the lack of expectations for sobriety and work.”

But nationwide, experts say the new approach could cost 170,000 people their homes, including many who are elderly or disabled. In Mecklenburg, Pelletier said 513 people currently live in so-called “permanent supportive housing.” She said the change could displace hundreds who’ve been stably housed for years.

“Without this assistance, many of them are going to end up back in our homeless system,” Pelletier said. In a community that already has more than 2,300 homeless people, what that means is unclear.

“We don’t have capacity in our shelter system,” Pelletier said.

A fraying public health safety net

Federal budget cuts. Vaccine skeptics. Looming Medicaid cuts. Rising health insurance costs. No single threat keeps Dr. Raynard Washington awake at night.

“They all keep you up,” said Washington, the county’s public health director.

He lost more than a dozen employees to budget cuts or program changes. That includes disease investigation specialists specializing in HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Though some jobs were restored, the interruption led to delays.

“The consequence of that is somebody else gets exposed to a disease,” Washington said.

Chelsea Gulden, executive director of RAIN, a nonprofit focused on HIV, told Qnotes that because of federal budget cuts, “we are poised to see numbers of HIV increase in a way we have not seen in years.”

Washington has seen evidence that more people appear to share Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s skepticism of vaccines. That includes public doubts about an early childhood vaccine that can prevent pertussis, or whooping cough. Washington said the number of pertussis cases, normally around two, jumped to 70 in the past year with outbreaks often concentrated.

Washington said there’s been a rise in the number of families seeking religious exemptions to school vaccine requirements. They “simply don’t know who to trust,” he said.

One out of three Mecklenburg residents – 416,000 – receive benefits from Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. County officials say as many as 31,000 could lose them under new federal work requirements. They say that could grow to more than 80,000 if North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion program ends.

The N.C. General Assembly has yet to act on that program, which serves more than 687,000 North Carolinians.

Then there’s the pending expiration of extended subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In Mecklenburg, that’s more than 135,000 people, according to Nicholas Riggs, director of the NC Navigator Consortium. He said premiums could soar.

Carolyn Willey of Indian Trail said her family of three has been paying around $400 a month under the ACA. Because her husband’s income as a general contractor rose to where they would lose their federal subsidy, they would now have to pay $1,200 a month for basic coverage.

“We were shocked to see it was going up that much,” Willey said.

Food assistance shrinks as need surges

On a sunny fall morning, Brittany Mays waited in her car outside an east Charlotte church that doubled as a mobile distribution site for Nourish Up. She’s a mother of four whose husband was laid off from a car dealership. They relied on SNAP – the federal emergency food program – until it was suspended during the 42-day government shutdown.

“With the change in income and not being able to afford the high price of groceries… it means a lot,” she said of the food donation.

The shutdown only exacerbated the challenge for Mecklenburg’s 137,000 SNAP recipients. Federal help has fallen sharply. Nourish Up, for example, has seen a 50% drop in help from the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Another program, which would have provided $11 million to food banks around the state, has ended.

This year Congress added work requirements to the SNAP program and shifted some costs to states and counties. Officials say the work requirements alone could result in 17,000 county residents losing benefits.

“What just baffles me beyond comprehension is the lack of compassion in all these policies for lower- and middle-income people,” said Tina Postel, Nourish Up’s CEO. “How much more cruel can you be to keep food off the plates of children and seniors on fixed income and hard working individuals who just aren’t making a livable wage?”

Policy shifts deepen fears in LGBTQ+ community

Annelise Mennicke has received a lot of research grants in her career, including from the National Institutes of Health. But she never lost one until this year.

Mennicke, who teaches in UNC Charlotte’s School of Social Work, had received a $450,000 grant from the NIH to help members of the LGBTQ+ community who became victims of sexual assault. Mennicke is research director for the university’s Violence Prevention Center.

In March she got a letter from the NIH. “This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” it read. “Research programs based on gender identity … do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.” Such studies, it added, ignore “biological realities.”

One of Trump’s first executive orders said, “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.”

Mennicke’s was one of 19 federally funded grants terminated at UNC Charlotte, according to school officials. Her grant was restored this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a mixed ruling in a case brought by the American Public Health Association.

But for Mennicke, “‘emotional roller coaster’ doesn’t begin to describe this experience.”

“I’ve been having panic attacks,” she said. “I’ve had trouble being present with my family. I’ve spiraled into existential crises around whether I can stay in academia, in North Carolina, or even in the United States. My grandmother fled Germany in 1939 to flee the Nazis … How did she know it was time to flee? How will I know?”

Amanda Dumas knew.

She was a Huntersville town commissioner until this fall when she and her 14-year-old transgender son moved to Canada. Like many members of the LGBTQ+ community and their families, she saw an increasingly threatening political environment. Then, she said, Atrium Health stopped offering gender affirming care this summer.

“That was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Dumas, who has dual citizenship. “There’s no reason for us to stay if we can no longer even access health care.”

DEI rollbacks reverberate through local institutions

On the day he took office, Trump signed an executive order calling Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs “illegal and immoral.”

“That ends today,” it said.

Ra’Shawn Flournoy, executive director of a health care center that caters to Black members of the LGBTQ+ community, has said DEI caused the center to lose a grant dealing with prevention of sexually transmitted infections.

“Our STI grant was cut,” he told Qnotes, “and because of the DEI mandate … the administration had actually even called us and said because we had language that had DEI in it, we had 48 hours to change it before we lost all of our funding.”

UNC Charlotte had already closed three DEI-related offices in 2024 to comply with system-wide UNC policies. Money and staff were reassigned to other programs.

This year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools lost about $6.8 million in grants to support teacher development and recruitment because they were perceived to foster DEI. Board Chair Stephanie Sneed said CMS still has to deal with the diversity of a district where 146 languages are spoken.

“Our district is majority-minority, and that demands that we lead with intentionality,” she said. “Programs that support multilingual learners, cultural diversity, and student-specific needs are not optional – they are essential to ensuring every child has access to rigorous instruction and real opportunity.”

Sneed said her more immediate concern is the well-being of the system’s 44,000 Hispanic students. With federal agents in town, some kids went to school with handwritten notes attached to their book bags saying, “I am a citizen.”

“It is the emotional impact that this has had on our families, which affects the ability to learn,” Sneed said. As many as 30,000 students missed school on one day during the crackdown. Sneed worries that they might not have had the breakfast or lunch they can get at school.

“It’s a cascading impact,” she said. “It contributes to our children being successful in our school district.”

Funding cuts undermine Charlotte's mobility gains

Opportunity – or the lack of it – was the theme of a 2014 study by Harvard researcher Raj Chetty. It ranked Charlotte and its surrounding area last among 50 U.S. cities in upward mobility. It was a wake-up call that prompted a concerted community effort to improve. The Charlotte area rose to 38th in last year’s Chetty rating.

Tonya Jameson, director of Civic Advancement for Leading on Opportunity, a nonprofit created to foster mobility, said the federal cuts don’t help.

“If a mother or father can’t feed their family, how can we expect them to be able to go to work and advance economically?” she said. “Now you’re forced to just be in survival mode.”

A survey of around 200 nonprofits by UNC Charlotte’s Urban Institute for the Foundation for the Carolinas and United Way of Greater Charlotte found that 30% reported cuts in public funding this year. Forty-seven percent reported losses from other sources.

The survey found that while most reported greater need for services and resources, 31% were serving fewer clients. “A growing barrier to community access of (nonprofit) services and resources was fear, particularly among marginalized communities,” the survey found. The full report has yet to be released.

“The threats are not just the federal budget cuts but … people aren’t giving as much generally,” said Tracy Russ of the Foundation for the Carolinas.

Ivan Canada, president and CEO of the N.C. Center for Nonprofits, said individual giving to many of the state’s 14,000 nonprofits has declined since Covid. One reason is that with higher standard tax deductions, there’s less incentive for some to give.

By some measures Americans are still generous. Giving by individuals, philanthropies and corporations rose to $592 billion in 2024, up 6.3% from the year before, according to Giving USA. But there are warning signs.

“There’s been a decline in trust in institutions in general and also with nonprofits,” said Michael Thatcher, CEO of Charity Navigator, a national ratings agency. “For the first time ever in 2024 the trust in nonprofits dropped below that of for-profit institutions. That’s new.”

It’s not just local funding cuts that affect Mecklenburg.

The end of solar tax credits could cost jobs in Mecklenburg’s clean energy industry, said Zach Amittay of E2, an advocacy group. It says the county has nearly 20,000 clean energy jobs.

And Internal Revenue Service cuts could cause delays in the free tax preparation services offered by the Davidson-based Ada Jenkins Center. Marsha Clark, director of the center’s asset building program, expects to help 3,200 clients next year.

“The bottom line is slowdowns,” she said.

Despite challenges, Charlotte's resilience endures

In late November, Manolo Betancur, whose Central Avenue bakery became an unofficial center for protests during the immigration crackdown, spoke at Myers Park Baptist Church.

“We used to feel alone,” he said. “I never thought we’d see this army of friends.”

During the crackdown people with camera phones videoed agents making arrests. Parents showed up at school parking lots to ensure students were safe. Churches and volunteers across the city collected and delivered food to families holed up at home. Students at several high schools walked out to protest the federal action.

“Allies are learning how to help their neighbors,” Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, told the Guardian newspaper. “(W)here this administration is trying to sow division, we see an organic movement of community members trying to provide support and assistance.”

Like the volunteers, people in the business of helping others believe Charlotte is a resilient community. Nonprofits coping with reduced budgets and other challenges have been working together.

In September, representatives from groups that included many non-profits packed a room in the Government Center. They shared their challenges and talked about ways to deal with them. They know, as Firmin-Sellers said, “There is no amount of philanthropy that can fill the gap that is being created.”

“We’re a tough bunch,” Firmin-Sellers said. “And we’re an optimistic bunch (or) we wouldn’t be doing this. “And so in spite of all the challenges, I think leaders are more engaged and more determined to continue to do as much good as we can with what we’ve got.

“The nonprofit leaders in this community continue to inspire me. And they should inspire us all.”

A new report from the UK-based nonprofit organization Centre for Net Zero, to which RMI contributed, considers the next phase of the global electric vehicle (EV) transition: mass adoption. This phase comes after years of targeted policy support, falling battery costs, and expanding global supply chains. It represents the steep part of the “S-curve” of technology adoption and is characterized by rapid cost reductions, improvements in quality, and stiffening competition.

Exhibit 1. EVs on the Technology S-Curve

This step involves overcoming challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with a rapidly scaling industry as well as the requirements for infrastructure integration. Three clear goals stand out: ensuring the transition is rapid, that it is equitable, and that it is systemically integrated with clean energy networks.

EV policy today, and what comes next

One in five new cars sold worldwide is already electric, and even though the US market is facing headwinds, global sales are continuing to accelerate rapidly. But this momentum is not enough to secure a cleaner transportation future. As with the rise of the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, which was supported by massive investment in roads, highways, and shifting city planning and zoning policies, today’s transition is driven by policy and technology. Without decisive policy, investment, and coordination, feedback loops could slow or reverse, lock in fossil fuel dependency for longer, or result in the build-out of supply chain, energy, and other infrastructure that is either too slow or not fit-for-purpose. Policy consistency is key to boosting market competitiveness and encouraging consumer confidence.

This article highlights four actions that can form the basis for a new strategy for the next phase of rapid growth:

Close the purchase price gap

Expand access to affordable charging

Prepare the electricity grid

Invest in circular and efficient manufacturing

Close the purchase price gap

In terms of new vehicles, EVs offer lower running costs than ICE vehicles, but this advantage is partially offset by higher upfront costs. 2024 saw global battery pack prices fall by 20 percent even as average size increased, but this hasn’t fully translated to lower retail prices for consumers. In China, a 30 percent fall in battery prices translated into a 10 percent decline in electric SUV prices; in Germany, EV retail prices rose slightly despite a 20 percent battery cost drop.

We expect costs to continue falling due to fundamental dynamics such as technological learning and economies, but subsidies and tax incentives can also play a role in closing the gap sooner. Policymakers will increasingly need to consider more targeted support for those who need it most. Examples of innovative financing models that can broaden access include blended finance models, ‘pay-as-you-drive’ schemes, flexible leasing, green bonds and concessional loans, and battery-as-a-service offerings.

Expand access to affordable charging

Without a reliable, accessible, and affordable public charging network, EVs cannot scale. Public charging is consistently cited as a key barrier, particularly among marginal adopters who prioritize convenience, accessibility, and range confidence. Survey data confirms that purchase intent rises sharply when public charging is perceived to match the ease of refueling an ICE vehicle.

Public charging is significantly more expensive than home charging — up to 10 times so in some countries. Yet, as EVs go mainstream, those dependent on the public charging network will form a growing share of users. For example, in Los Angeles, analysis by NREL finds that, by 2035, public charging could cost an additional $300/year for the 20 percent of households who will lack at-home charging access. Parallel efforts on expanding access to home charging and increasing the affordability of public charging are needed.

Smart public charging — matching demand with cheaper electricity supply — can also help close the affordability gap by delivering cheap off-peak charging to households, as it does in domestic settings.

Centre for Net Zero’s research shows that dynamic pricing can encourage drivers charging outside of their homes to do so when electricity costs are cheaper, reducing EV running costs below those of petrol cars. Lower-income areas showed the strongest behavioral response, indicating that they may stand to gain the most.

Prepare the electricity grid

The need to expand and reinforce grid capacity is well understood. But simply building up the grid is not enough. Existing approaches to utility planning are creating bottlenecks for charging infrastructure expansion. A modern, EV-ready connection regime must prioritize speed, transparency, and flexibility for vehicles of all sizes.

On the supply side:

Current regulatory models, based on cost prudence and recovery, often cause investment timelines for grid upgrades to be mismatched with the needs of EV charging installations. While EV charging sites can usually be built in less than six months, distribution system upgrades can take two to five years.

Better forecasting, guided by tools such as RMI’s GridUp, can help grid planning shift from reactive to proactive. Anticipatory investment in grid upgrades, reforms to connection processes, and increased utilization of grid flexibility are all solutions that can help the grid better meet EV charging demand.

Flexible service connections can allow charging sites to make more efficient use of existing grid infrastructure. By working with the capacity that is typically available outside of a few peak hours of the year, these alternatives can power charging a majority of the time without creating a need for more investment in the grid. This allows charging to become available faster at less cost to the utility.

On the demand side:

If left unmanaged, widespread charging will exacerbate existing grid constraints, leading to instability, rising infrastructure costs, and higher bills for consumers.

Managed charging will be a key solution. RMI analysis shows that managed charging could reduce EV charging contribution to peak demand by nearly a third in New York State. EVs could also absorb surplus renewable energy and ease congestion, ultimately lowering system costs. Similarly, Centre for Net Zero analysis shows managed charging at home can shift the entirety of EV demand to low-cost, low-emission off-peak periods. Where dynamic pricing exists, these cost savings can be passed through to consumers — around £650 for UK customers compared to flat-rate tariffs.

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology — which allows consumers to export electricity back to the grid from their EVs — could provide even more of the same system benefits but will require bi-directional capability. In the UK, Center for Net Zero finds that widespread V2G adoption could absorb larger volumes of variable renewable generation, leading to a reduction in average wholesale electricity prices of up to 10 percent by 2030.

Invest in circular and efficient manufacturing

EVs already have a structural advantage over ICE vehicles: while both require material inputs, EVs rely on a one-time extraction of battery minerals, whereas ICE vehicles lock in a perpetual dependence on fossil extraction.

Nonetheless, the rising demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel raises legitimate sustainability concerns. One answer is battery recycling, which is already advancing rapidly: In 2019, 59 percent of lithium-ion batteries were recycled globally, and estimates now suggest this figure could be approaching 90 percent. Modern processes can recover from 80 to 95 percent of minerals, and this is expected to rise to 95–99 percent within a decade. Announced recycling capacity is already sufficient to manage all end-of-life batteries through 2030.

Exhibit 5. Total battery mineral ore needed to sustain EVs vs. oil extracted each year for non-electric vehicles

The need for critical minerals, and even new battery recycling capacity, can also be reduced by improving vehicle efficiency. This can be achieved in several ways, including improved aerodynamics, the use of lighter materials, and vehicle size. Smaller EVs require smaller batteries — which have the added benefit of lower costs. For example, the already heavyweight GMC Hummer EV requires a 246 kWh battery that weighs as much as a sedan itself, while the compact Chevrolet Bolt EV only needs a 66 kWh battery. Unfortunately, efficiency is not always top of consumer minds: demand for ever bigger cars continues to rise.

The goal is no longer simply more EVs, but smarter, fairer, and more sustainable deployment — ensuring that EVs work with, not against, the systems they depend on. The four actions above are not comprehensive but represent the priority areas where stakeholders should seek to align as EVs enter this critical next stage. Getting this right will make the difference for a healthy environment, stronger economy, and a sustainably sourced future for cars.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1393199281.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:59:56.488336

Trump Media & Technology Group, the company which owns the US president's social media platform Truth Social, has bought a fusion power company for $US6 billion ($9 billion).

Fusion energy, which is different from nuclear energy, has long been hoped to generate vast amounts of energy with little danger but has so far not been commercially viable.

The unusual tie-up comes as the Trump administration pushes power-hungry AI technology that will require a massive build-out of energy sources.

Trump Media & Technology Group, the struggling company that owns the US president's Truth Social platform, has announced a $US6 billion ($9 billion) merger with fusion power company TAE Technologies, in an unexpected pivot into energy technology.

The all-stock transaction will see shareholders of each company hold approximately 50 per cent of the combined entity, which plans to begin construction of what it calls the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026.

Trump Media's share price has slumped by about 70 per cent in the past year but was up nearly 25 per cent after the announcement.

Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican legislator, said the deal represents ""a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations.""

Fusion power plants would generate electricity through the same process that powers the Sun, a goal long pursued by researchers, though no commercially viable project has yet been built despite decades of research.

The unusual tie-up comes as the Trump administration pushes power-hungry AI technology that will require a massive build-out of energy sources.

AI data centres are posing an increasing burden on US power grids, and the White House is encouraging the fast-tracking of energy projects to meet demand.

Trump Media generates only $US1.7m in revenue

TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, says its fusion technology could provide abundant electricity to power AI infrastructure.

The California-based company has built five fusion reactors and employs over 400 people, including 62 Ph.D. holders, a statement said.

The company has raised more than $US1.3 billion from investors including Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs. Trump Media has agreed to provide up to $US300 million in cash to TAE.

Trump Media has launched several projects in recent months, including cryptocurrency-related financial products and a video streaming platform, but generated only $US1.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2025.

Mr Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company, while Michael Schwab of Big Sky Partners is expected to chair a nine-member board that will include Donald Trump Jr., the president's son.

The transaction requires shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to close by mid-2026.

About Per Scholas As Per Scholas celebrates 30 years of impact, we are charting an ambitious path forward— expanding access to high-growth tech careers and fostering economic mobility nationwide.","New data shows 339 learners trained statewide through the grant, earning an average of 2.6X their pre-program income

Graduation ceremony held today in Uptown Charlotte celebrated gradates on pathways to tech careers

Charlotte, NC — December 18, 2025 — Today, free tech-training program Per Scholas North Carolina and The BlackRock Foundation celebrated a major milestone: 339 North Carolinians trained in less than one year through their IT workforce training initiative. New data shows graduates are earning, on average, 2.6 times their pre-program income, representing an estimated $100 million in lifetime earnings uplift.

Earlier this year, The BlackRock Foundation committed $1 million to Per Scholas North Carolina to expand access to high-quality tech training and prepare more North Carolinians for in-demand jobs. Less than a year into the partnership, the initiative is well on track to meet its two-year goal of training 530 learners, with graduates earning industry-recognized credentials and already securing in-demand jobs across the technology sector including Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Data Analytics.

The program is reaching those who stand to benefit most: 38% of graduates hold only a high school diploma, and 42% are parents with children under 18. The resulting estimated income gains are helping families build long-term financial stability.

“As a proud North Carolina resident, I’m thrilled to see The BlackRock Foundation partnering with Per Scholas to expand opportunity in the community,” said Carrie Schroen, a BlackRock Managing Director. “Helping more people experience financial well-being – including building the foundation for a secure retirement – is central to BlackRock’s purpose. We’re honored to invest in the region’s future. These students are not only building careers, they’re paving the way toward lasting financial security and I’m excited to see the impact they will make in our communities.”

One of today’s graduates, Tim Kinsey, enrolled in Per Scholas Western North Carolina’s IT Support course in June 2025 while he was juggling a series of hourly service jobs and earning below the region’s basic living-wage thresholds. Today, he graduated and has already secured a full-time Computer Support Technician I role with Henderson County, earning an annual salary nearly double his previous income and beginning a stable career track rarely accessible in rural counties without formal tech training.

“Before Per Scholas, I was piecing together several jobs just to get by,” said Tim Kinsey, Per Scholas North Carolina Graduate. “Now I’m stepping into a career with real growth, benefits, and the chance to build a future for my family — all while staying in the community I love.”

The program’s impact is especially significant in Western NC, where typical entry-level wages are $15–$17 per hour. Launched in partnership with Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College after Hurricane Helene, Per Scholas Western NC is creating pathways into resilient, higher-wage tech careers and is on track to train 100 rural learners by 2026.

“We’re just getting started in rural North Carolina, and the results already speak for themselves. When learners double or even triple their income, that’s not only life-changing for their families — it strengthens entire communities,” stated Per Scholas North Carolina Senior Managing Director Mike Terrell. “These are dollars that stay local, support small businesses, and help rural economies grow. Thanks to The BlackRock Foundation’s grant we’re proving what’s possible when talent meets opportunity.”

In North Carolina—where BlackRock has invested over $100 billion in NC-based public companies on behalf of clients—the BlackRock Foundation is partnering with Per Scholas to fuel greater economic opportunity. Through the firm’s investments on behalf of clients and The Foundation’s philanthropic support, BlackRock is supporting North Carolina families in taking steps to secure their financial futures.

“Tim’s story exemplifies the mission of The BlackRock Foundation,” said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. “By ensuring people have the skills for in-demand jobs, Per Scholas is helping more North Carolinians get on the path to thriving wage careers in their own communities so they can support their families and build financial security.”

Today’s ceremony in Uptown Charlotte celebrated graduates’ achievements and featured remarks from Per Scholas alumni living in Charlotte and Western North Carolina, and from BlackRock Managing Director, Carrie Schroen.

Per Scholas also announced the launch of its third cohort in January, continuing its momentum and opening doors for even more North Carolinians in 2026. To register for the next cohort, check out the Per Scholas North Carolina registration page: https://perscholas.org/locations/northcarolina/.

By Sheila Kennedy

December 18, 2025

Heather Cox Richardson recently explored the success of Trump’s “sales pitch,” which she attributed to his ability to leverage a belief in the victimization of White folks that Republicans have increasingly embraced since the 1980s. As she put it, the message boiled down to “the reason certain white Americans were being left behind in the modern world was not that Republican policies had transferred more than $50 trillion from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%, but that lazy and undeserving Black and Brown Americans and women were taking handouts from the government rather than working.”

I think this is exactly right.

After all, as a man and a candidate, Trump is repulsive. His “policies” are laughable when they aren’t appalling, raising the question why anyone would support him. Political scholarship has answered that question by linking his ability to generate votes to “racial resentment,” and that link becomes more obvious every time he talks about “shithole” countries, calls Black immigrants “garbage,” or attacks “woke-ism” or DEI. But it isn’t just race–Trump and MAGA have built their appeal on resentment of every American who isn’t a White Christian male: the “uppity” women who’ve forgotten their proper role, the LGBTQ+ folks who had the nerve to open the closet door, Jews and Muslims. Etc.

The base of the appeal, as the Richardson quote suggests, is the festering anger of victimhood. There are thousands of White “Christian” nationalists whose lives haven’t gone the way they wanted or intended. Perhaps it’s that they haven’t accumulated the wealth they once thought they’d enjoy, or generated the admiration or applause or familial love to which they felt entitled. Perhaps they’re among the self-described Incels.

We have all encountered people nursing these grievances. Sometimes, their complaints are very understandable; other times, disconnected from their public-facing financial or social positions. Whatever these White “Christian” men feel is missing, whatever the nature of the deeply-felt disappointment, their lives aren’t providing something to which they feel entitled. Not only do they resent the fact that their lives have failed to meet their expectations, they need to believe that–whatever it is–it simply cannot be their own fault.

“Mining at this site has wreaked havoc on the lives of Southern Illinois residents for years,” said Amanda Pankau, Director of Energy and Community Resiliency at Prairie Rivers Network.

The decision would allow Sugar Camp Mine to mine over 20,000 acres of TVA-owned coal now, and allow TVA to privatize the entire 60,000 acres of underground federal coal reserves in Franklin, Hamilton, and Jefferson counties. The Trump administration’s promises to resurrect coal largely ignore the economic realities of the industry’s decades-long decline, however the administration's efforts are already harming the health and safety of miners and leading to more air and water pollution.

The current mine operators and their parent company, Foresight, have a long history of noncompliance with mining and worker safety protections, including negligence leading to miner deaths and numerous water quality violations from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Specifically, the operator misused toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) firefighting foam in an attempt to put out a mine fire, and they criminally failed to notify workers working in the mine while the fire burned.

“Mining at this site has wreaked havoc on the lives of Southern Illinois residents for years,” said Amanda Pankau, Director of Energy and Community Resiliency at Prairie Rivers Network. “Not only do mining discharges threaten their ability to enjoy Illinois' beautiful natural spaces, but residents have also experienced damage to their homes and properties, faced exposure to harmful chemicals like PFAS, and worry every day about potential impacts to their own health.”

The TVA proposal would significantly increase the state’s climate and health harming coal extraction at a time when Illinois is taking nation-leading action to reduce its carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.

“Illinois is making bold progress on the climate crisis, and is creating thousands of good jobs building clean energy to replace coal in our power supply,” said Jack Darin, Director of the Sierra Club, Illinois Chapter. “We cannot let the federal government take us backward with a massive expansion of coal mining, especially at a site where the operator is already in flagrant violation of environmental laws and guilty of polluting the groundwater with forever toxins.”

The complaint was filed in federal court for the Southern District of Illinois. Prairie Rivers Network is represented in the matter by Rob Weinstock of the Northwestern Environmental Advocacy Center, and Sierra Club Illinois is represented by Albert Ettinger.

“TVA’s actions are unlawful, arbitrary, and irresponsible. Its choices fail the standards set by Congress in the National Environmental Policy Act and Administrative Procedures Act and are set to devastate rural communities and ecosystems.” said Robert Weinstock of the Northwestern Environmental Advocacy Center.

“TVA’s decision to allow the mining and burning of this coal will contribute substantially to flooding, extreme weather, extinction of wildlife, and other known effects of climate change,” Pankau said. “The people of Southern Illinois deserve better.”

Instead, the F-150 Lightning nameplate will live on and be used for an all-new range-extender hybrid (EREV) version of its full-size F-150 ute.

The new F-150 Lightning EREV will be built at Ford’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, on the same production line as the outgoing truck.

Combining a petrol engine that acts as a generator with an all-electric powertrain, Ford claims the new F-150 Hybrid can drive more than 700 miles (1126km) with a full tank of fuel and topped-up battery.

As well as the all-electric F-150 Lightning replacement, Ford has also admitted its electric replacement for the E-Transit van due in 2028 has been put on ice.

Work is already underway to re-engineer it for petrol and hybrid power.

One EV Ford is racing to launch is the small mid-size Ranchero. The Ranger-sized all-electric ute set to be the first of a new family of affordable EVs based on Ford’s new low-cost universal EV platform.

The same architecture is allegedly destined by 2030 to underpin as much as half of all Fords sold globally.

Helping boost its appeal, when it lands in early 2027, the new Ranchero will “cater to customers who want more for their money – more range, more utility, [and] more usability”.

Back in Australia, Ford still struggles to sell EVs, with volumes of the Mustang Mach-E having fallen by 31.9 per cent to just 435.

It is currently outsold by the Toyota bZ4X three-to-one.

Meanwhile, the battery-electric E-Transit is said to only account for seven per cent of total Transit sales.

From now on Ford said it would focus its resources on rolling out smaller more affordable EVs all built on the new Universal EV platform.

Finally, to fulfil its 2030 ambitions that more than 50 per cent of all vehicles sold will either an EV, hybrid or range-extender hybrid, Ford says it will launch a new hybrid version of every current series models it makes.

As well as F-150 Lightning EREV, Ford will also introduce a Bronco EREV that should offer a larger all-electric range with near unmatched off-road capability.

The Safest “Asymmetric Bet” in Advanced Energy

Backed by global leaders such as Google and Chevron, as well as multiple Nobel laureates, TAE’s unique approach to fusion has been technically validated through milestones, including the achievement of extreme plasma temperatures. Unlike other ventures, TAE’s strategy offers two paths to success: its premium, advanced fuel source or a robust “tritium parachute” that still provides a projected 100 times economic advantage over mainstream rivals. This revolutionary dual-path strategy dramatically reduces the capital investment risk, offering a high-reward future with a solid safety net, and placing TAE on a plausible roadmap for commercial energy deployment in the early to mid-2030s.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this home construction supplier have returned +12.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Building Products - Wood industry, to which Louisiana-Pacific belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Louisiana-Pacific is expected to post earnings of $0.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -94.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.

The consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -54.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.8 indicates a change of +41.4% from what Louisiana-Pacific is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Assuming ample battery and hydraulic storage can be provided, these clean energy sources are part of the future energy mix.","As 2025 draws to a close, the Trump White House, Department of Energy, Department of Interior, the EPA, and numerous other federal agencies involved in regulating energy and the environment have shifted away from the Biden Administration’s emphasis on “green transitions” and expensive renewables, and towards an approach that prioritizes conventional energy sources and energy security. The climate change assumptions of the Obama-Biden era that guided U.S. energy policy since 2008 are no longer influential. Today, energy security is paramount, and economic efficiency takes precedence over other concerns, with federal efforts to decarbonize and move toward a clean energy economy being replaced by initiatives that expand oil and gas production and accelerate the development of traditional energy sources — hydrocarbons and nuclear.

Beyond its domestic priorities, Washington has highlighted reliance on and export of energy as a tool of geopolitical leverage and influence. Collectively, these policy shifts demonstrate how Trump II is shaping the current U.S. energy landscape. Entering 2026 and the remainder of Trump’s term, key questions remain regarding the strategies and other provisions the administration will enact, as well as how it will further enforce this energy reorientation. While hydrocarbon production and sales are ramping up (particularly LNG), America needs to up its game to catch up to China in the nuclear arena. The U.S. should also not rule out renewables if, when, and where they make sense, as capital markets demonstrated enthusiasm about the renewables.

1: A National Energy Emergency

One of the earliest policy initiatives of this year was the January 20th declaration of a National Energy Emergency. Issued the day of President Trump’s inauguration, this Executive Order directed a strong focus on hydrocarbons to increase energy and infrastructure development. Citing the National Emergencies Act and stressing the need to expand domestic energy sources and wean the nation off reliance on foreign energy imports, Trump urged the Federal government to prioritize the development of the nation's fossil fuels and nuclear energy infrastructure.

The “Unleashing American Energy” directives, also announced immediately following the inauguration, directed a broader, national-scale approach to fossil fuel development as a companion piece to the National Energy Emergency declaration. Although it did not entirely reject clean energy policies or projects, it set a clear tone for energy policy in 2025: Clean energy would sink or swim on its own merits, while hydrocarbons would receive more support for geostrategic reasons. So far, the markets are more enthusiastic about renewables than about fossil fuels.

2: Redirection of Renewable Energy and EV Incentives

Before the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill, tax incentives under the Biden Administration supported the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy technology. This year, the credits and incentives for EVs and clean-energy charging stations were eliminated as of September 30th. Rescaling, restructuring, or a complete lapse of clean energy credits and programs has occurred. Such incentives are not central to the current administration’s energy strategy.

MORE FOR YOU

On a broader scale, government support for clean energy projects, including the development of wind and solar infrastructure, has also declined. Licensing for conventional energy development projects has not slowed, but permits for renewable energy projects have been stalled, many awaiting federal action and approval in 2025. Without subsidies or tax credits, some of these projects will likely incur negative ROI, while others will remain profitable, as the companies’ market performance suggests. The federal focus on financial incentives for individuals and corporations has shifted to those that support market-driven and conventional energy approaches.

3: U.S. Expansion of Offshore Energy Exploration

A notable resurgence of offshore oil and gas exploration and leasing occurred in 2025. In November, the Department of the Interior launched an “expansive” 11th national offshore leasing program, “Unleashing American Offshore Energy,” under an Order from Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum that terminates the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program established under the Biden Administration. This program plans for as many as 34 potential offshore lease sales across multiple U.S. regions.

Late this year, leasing got underway. In 2023, a sale of federal Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico) oil and gas leases became the subject of a court battle, with the Biden Administration and environmental groups claiming concerns about the endangered Rice’s Whale, on the one hand, and oil and gas companies as well as legislators from energy-producing states, citing the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, on the other. This December, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held its first major offshore lease sale since then, offering tens of millions of acres in the Gulf of America.

These developments reflect the broader push by the Trump Administration to increase fossil fuel production and expand offshore energy exploration after years in which offshore expansion had de facto been rendered taboo. Major oil companies such as BP and Chevron participated in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s December bidding process. They will likely be part of this attempt to increase U.S. energy production in the Gulf of America and other areas.

4: U.S. LNG Exports Surge on Global Markets

One of the most pronounced effects of the Trump administration's shift in energy policy has been the growth of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. American developers signed a series of sales and purchase agreements that significantly increased U.S. LNG’s impact in global markets. The growing demand for U.S. LNG broke the $5/mmbtu threshold for future shipments in December, which had not been reached in several years. Part of this expansion stems from the immediate lifting of restrictions imposed by the Biden administration to permit trade, including countries without a free trade agreement with the U.S.

There has been considerable growth in demand in European markets, driven by limited gas supply and storage from Europe’s traditional supplier, Russia, as the Russia-Ukraine war drags on. According to the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, in 2025 “…LNG imports surpassed pipeline gas imports in the EU for the first time. During this period, U.S. LNG accounted for 28% of total EU gas imports and 55% of LNG imports, on track to reach record levels by the end of 2025.” As these energy constraints from Russia endure, reducing supply to Europe, demand for U.S. LNG in European markets is expected to grow. Whatever qualms the Europeans may have about Trump, they have far greater reservations about Putin and Russian aggression.

5: The Nuclear Renaissance Needs More Research and Innovation

Nuclear energy also received renewed attention in 2025, as policymakers have reconsidered its role in supporting reliable energy and building grid reliability. As a result, Executive Orders were issued in May to remove regulatory barriers established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that have stalled U.S. nuclear energy expansion and to advance atomic power research. However, nuclear power development depends on economics, financing, proven technology breakthroughs (especially in the Small Modular Reactor industry), and a benign regulatory climate that eschews the “Not in My Back Yard” approach of many American states.

Moving Forward

Under Trump, the U.S. increased energy production and sought to make its industry more competitive with those of all other G-7 members. The U.S. and China supply energy at approximately 8c/kWh for industrial consumers. Europe is lagging, with costs for industrial consumers roughly twice as high. However, the U.S. is falling behind China, which has 32 nuclear reactors approved for construction, while the U.S. has only two.

With AI and data center expansion, transportation electrification, and population growth in the country’s south, the U.S. needs to secure ample and affordable electricity with a minimal carbon footprint. While the American shale oil and natural gas supply remains safe and secure, at least until 2028, the time has come for a major redesign and push for a reliable, safe, and affordable nuclear reactor fleet made in the U.S.A.

Additionally, America should not dismiss solar, wind, and other renewables, such as geothermal, when they make economic sense. Assuming ample battery and hydraulic storage can be provided, these clean energy sources are part of the future energy mix. For now, China leads the clean energy industries, from PV panels to storage batteries. It is time to engage in full-bore competition to further America’s energy dominance.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/694309c287ea3cbc42ca8a05/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:57.926932

HB7287 extends the 10 percent corporation business tax surcharge (which increases the corporate income tax rate) for an additional three years, to the 2026 through 2028 tax years. However, under the act, the surcharge that applies to the capital base (capital stock) tax component of the corporation business tax applies only for the 2026 and 2027 tax years because that component is scheduled to be eliminated starting in 2028.

Whether families face massive premium increases in 2026 depends on Senate action.","More than 20 million Americans with marketplace coverage are approaching an affordability cliff. The expiration of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits on December 31, 2025, will cause average premium costs to more than double in 2026.

After months of congressional Republican obstruction, a discharge petition will now force the House to vote on a clean, three-year extension of the enhanced premium tax credits in January. That vote creates a clear path forward to preserving affordability. However, preventing massive premium increases in 2026 will ultimately depend on whether the Senate acts to protect families from higher health insurance costs.

A new analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund finds that 2026 ACA health insurance marketplace premium costs will increase by thousands of dollars in 13 states where Republican senators could face accountability from voters, are retiring, or may otherwise be persuadable.

A hypothetical family of four (40- and 38-year-old parents of two children, ages 14 and 12) with an annual income of $161,000 in Anchorage, Alaska, would pay more than $25,100 in annual additional premium costs if the tax credits expire.

The financial strain would extend to single-parent households as well. A 55-year-old parent with an 18-year-old earning $85,000 annually in Portland, Maine, would face a $12,700 increase in annual premiums.

Young adults would also see higher costs. In Huntsville, Alabama, a 27-year-old earning $63,000 annually would need to pay an additional $1,365 to keep their marketplace coverage.

Older adults would face the steepest increases. For instance, in Charleston, West Virginia, premiums for a 62-year-old couple making $85,000 could surge by nearly $52,000.

Conclusion

The House vote is now unavoidable. Whether families face massive premium increases in 2026 depends on Senate action.

The National Petroleum Council’s (“NPC”) Committee on Oil and Natural Gas Infrastructure Permitting issued a December 3rd draft report titled:

Bottleneck to Breakthrough: A Permitting Blueprint to Build (“Report”).

NPC describes the Report as providing:

… practical solutions to modernize permitting and catalyze investment in America’s energy infrastructure.

The Report was prepared at the request of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright asking that the NPC undertake a Future Energy Systems study to provide advice on ensuring the availability of affordable, reliable, and secure energy for American consumers and allies. The request is stated to have specifically called for the delivery of a short-term study on streamlining and expediting oil and natural gas infrastructure permitting to meet future energy needs.

What are described as “focal points” of the permitting study include:

Recent major economic and geopolitical developments affecting energy delivery and demand.

Inefficiencies experienced under existing permitting laws, processes, and coordination efforts.

Administrative and legislative reforms to accelerate approvals without compromising environmental protections.

What are described as systemic permitting barriers delaying timely approvals and hindering efficient construction of energy infrastructure are stated to include:

Lengthy, fragmented reviews.

Litigation-driven delays.

Regulatory inconsistency.

Capacity shortfalls.

Infrastructure bottlenecks.

By way of summary of conclusions, the Report proposes what is described as a “two-pronged approach” that includes:

Immediate reforms to streamline existing processes, referencing clarification of National Environmental Policy Act reviews and reducing procedural delays.

Development of a new, standardized permitting framework for qualified projects.

The study team preparing the report is described as approximately 110 experts from over 40 organizations. Some of the participants are stated to have originated from outside of the oil and gas industry.

NPC describes itself as an organization whose sole purpose it to provide advice to the federal government. There are about 200 NPC members which are appointed by the Department of Energy’s Secretary that include:

All segments of the oil and natural gas industry.

All segments of the country.

Large and small companies.

With a major radius of 8 meters, Helios is the most compact optimized stellarator power plant architecture, according to the company.
Next steps: In the next few years, Thea Energy plans to verify and de-risk the operation of the plasma and subsystems in its large-scale demonstration facility, Eos, which is scheduled to be operational by 2030.
Quotables: “Helios does not rely on future scientific breakthroughs,” said David Gates, cofounder and chief technology officer of Thea Energy.
Other innovations include the power handling scheme, where a topology closely related to the conventional tokamak solution has been found for the first time in a stellarator power plant design.”","Formerly Princeton Stellarators, Thea Energy is a spin-out of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Princeton University and was one of eight companies selected in 2023 for the Department of Energy’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. According to the company, the completion of the preconceptual Helios design meets the last major milestone in the initial phase of the DOE’s public-private program to develop fusion pilot plant designs and resolve related scientific and technological challenges.

Paper reactor: Thea Energy has released an unpublished paper, “Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant,” that details the Helios design. According to the company, the system combines software-controlled magnet coils that are adaptable to real-world conditions, a stellarator divertor exhaust system capable of fusion power operations, and a sector-based maintenance scheme enabling long-term plant viability.

Based on a planar coil stellarator architecture, Helios has a thermal power output of 1.1 GW, with the capability of producing 390 MW of net electric power. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils, like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. The coils have a maximum magnetic field strength of 20 tesla.

With a major radius of 8 meters, Helios is the most compact optimized stellarator power plant architecture, according to the company.

Next steps: In the next few years, Thea Energy plans to verify and de-risk the operation of the plasma and subsystems in its large-scale demonstration facility, Eos, which is scheduled to be operational by 2030.

Thea Energy said it is currently in conversations with five states for the siting of Eos and expects to select and announce a location for the integrated system in 2026. The company added that it is on track to operate Helios in the 2030s.

Quotables: “Helios does not rely on future scientific breakthroughs,” said David Gates, cofounder and chief technology officer of Thea Energy. “Helios is designed to combine the inherent benefits of the stellarator—steady-state operation, no risk of damaging disruptions, and high efficiency—with programmable, planar magnets. This is the evolution of the stellarator for commercialization. Our proprietary architecture can individually control hundreds of magnets using a software stack to configure stellarator magnetic fields, while accounting for manufacturing and assembly errors as well as system wear and tear over its operational lifetime.”

Carlos Paz-Soldan, associate professor of applied physics and applied mathematics at Columbia University, added, “Thea Energy’s design presents several significant innovations on the conventional approach to build stellarators. The planar coils are easier to manufacture and promise to reduce overall system complexity. They also provide new flexibility to the concept and facilitate plant maintenance. Other innovations include the power handling scheme, where a topology closely related to the conventional tokamak solution has been found for the first time in a stellarator power plant design.”",https://www.ans.org/file/23003/l/Picture1.png,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:11.027566

The project is positioned as one of Europe’s first fully integrated operations combining lithium production with renewable energy generation.
This scope includes powering Vulcan’s Lithium Extraction Plant in Landau, the Central Lithium Plant near Frankfurt and the surrounding well sites.
Speaking to Reuters, Francis Wedin, Executive Chair of Vulcan Energy, said construction was now fully funded and set to begin immediately.
Cris Moreno, Managing Director and CEO at Vulcan Energy, comments: ""ABB’s expertise and systems give us the certainty to scale efficiently.","Vulcan Energy has named ABB its main electrical contractor for Phase One of the Lionheart Project, a major renewable lithium facility in Germany's Upper Rhine Valley. The project is positioned as one of Europe’s first fully integrated operations combining lithium production with renewable energy generation.

The partnership involves three contracts valued at more than US$50m for ABB to supply the complete electrical infrastructure.

This scope includes powering Vulcan’s Lithium Extraction Plant in Landau, the Central Lithium Plant near Frankfurt and the surrounding well sites. ABB is set to manage the entire electrical system from the high-voltage grid connection down to building-level processes.

The collaboration could provide a model for integrating clean energy with advanced electrification in industrial settings.

Supplying lithium for half a million EVs

The Lionheart Project aims to produce 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) per year. This refined form of lithium is used in batteries and the projected output will be enough to power around 500,000 electric vehicles annually.

Vulcan’s approach combines lithium extraction with the generation of renewable energy, aiming to deliver 275 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity and 560 GWh of heat.

This dual output supports both industrial operations and contributes to broader clean energy goals.

The integrated nature of the facility means that Vulcan can supply lithium and renewable energy from a single project location, offering a more sustainable option for downstream manufacturers.

The company has already secured agreements to supply lithium from 2028 for 10 years to major companies including Stellantis, LG Corp, Umicore and Glencore. These offtake agreements are designed to support a stable supply of lithium for battery manufacturing across Europe.

Speaking to Reuters, Francis Wedin, Executive Chair of Vulcan Energy, said construction was now fully funded and set to begin immediately. He confirmed the project would take two-and-a-half years, with full-scale operations expected once commissioning is complete.

Multi-layered financing

Vulcan’s funding package totals US$2.56bn and combines equity, grants and debt. The equity component includes up to US$709m raised through institutional placements and entitlement offers at a fixed price of US$2.63 per new share.

This financing is backed by 13 financial institutions including the European Investment Bank, five export credit agencies and seven commercial banks. Vulcan has also received US$122m in German government grants as part of Berlin’s strategy to reduce reliance on imported raw materials and strengthen domestic electric vehicle production.

The partnership with ABB stems from a Memorandum of Understanding signed back in April 2024. It aims to streamline engineering, optimise supply chains and reduce project costs. Under the agreement, ABB’s electrification expertise supports Vulcan’s renewable lithium process.

Cris Moreno, Managing Director and CEO at Vulcan Energy, comments: ""ABB’s expertise and systems give us the certainty to scale efficiently. Together, we are establishing a robust model for industrial lithium production to meet market momentum while enabling battery supply chain decarbonisation at scale.”

ABB technology to underpin clean energy goals

ABB’s scope covers high-, medium- and low-voltage electrical systems, including switchgear, transformers, protection equipment and uninterruptible power supplies. The goal is to ensure a stable and efficient flow of electricity from the 110 kilovolt (kV) grid through to every process within the facility.

By handling the design, engineering, manufacturing, testing and delivery, ABB ensures that every aspect of electrical performance aligns with both safety and sustainability standards. The company’s MNS low-voltage switchgear, already used across mining and industrial sites worldwide, is a central part of the infrastructure.

As Vulcan prepares for full-scale construction, ABB’s electrical systems will play a critical role in delivering power safely and reliably.

With lithium output backed by long-term contracts and supported by a network of institutional investors, the Lionheart Project is positioned to become a cornerstone in Europe’s transition to clean energy and sustainable mobility.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/03fa87a5f7d02e71a87a239d771dfdac:6cb6d2a37d15db2177412515609bfed2/vulcan-groundbreaking.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:54.757501

“This comes after a year during which Duke Energy made record profits,” Cohen said.
Duke Energy announced $1.4 billion in profits last quarter, up 11% from last fall.","Under the proposal, residential rates for Duke Energy Carolinas customers would increase nearly 12%, and by more than 14% for Duke Energy Progress customers. This is what Duke is proposing:

Residential rates for DEC customers would increase 11.9% in 2027 and 4% in 2028.

Residential rates for DEP customers would increase 14.1% in 2027 and 3.5% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEC customers would increase 8.7% in 2027 and 3.9% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEP customers would increase 9.2% in 2027 and 4.6% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEC customers would increase 6.3% in 2027 and 3.4% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEP customers would increase 7.4% in 2027 and 4.3% in 2028.

Residential rate hikes are higher, in part, because they fund distribution upgrades that don’t serve industrial customers, according to Duke Energy. That includes the lines that deliver power to homes and neighborhoods.

Shannon Binns, executive director of Sustain Charlotte, said low- to moderate-income households are being squeezed from both sides.

“It is harder to pay the bills when all the bills keep going up, and income is not going up in the same way,” Binns said. His nonprofit returned a $10,000 sponsorship to Duke Energy early this year. The move came after Binns learned that the utility signed on to a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin requesting that the federal agency roll back carbon and coal ash regulations.

Asheville resident Rachel Cohen expressed a similar sentiment toward the rate hikes during a public utility hearing Tuesday night.

“This comes after a year during which Duke Energy made record profits,” Cohen said.

Duke Energy announced $1.4 billion in profits last quarter, up 11% from last fall. The rate increases will need approval from state regulators.

“It was shocking in a sense that they would be so brazen as to ask for such a dramatic increase, which, of course, higher electric bills fall much harder on low- and middle-income households and seniors and people on fixed incomes, given that they just had a record year for profits,” Binns said.

Binns said recent legislation, such as SB 266, has made it easier for the utility to build riskier new nuclear facilities, as well as new natural gas plants, “adding more fossil fuels and the gases that are heating up our planet.”

Duke Energy proposed a new resource plan earlier that would allow the utility to build 9,650 megawatts of new natural gas capacity over the next decade. Duke representatives said the company still aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, relying on new nuclear facilities to replace energy generated by new natural gas turbines.

Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton said these rate hikes are going toward funding grid hardening and “smart-healing technology.” These projects include “the steel poles along the Swannanoa River that withstood Hurricane Helene.”

“Such grid investments are the majority of the current rate review request,” Norton said in a written response to WFAE. “Other factors in the rate request include weatherization and reliability upgrades for our existing power plants, as well as solar already approved and installed under the initial Carbon Plan. Those are applicable to the current rate case, not to future resource plan projections.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41646e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7214x3787+0+135/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2e%2F49%2Fa07aaf414a1eab92e6c7a6132501%2Fduke-energy-lineman-at-work02-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:44.332868

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom.","Calls are mounting for the largest U.S. grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record of $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in the year starting June 2027, according to PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans, including customers in southwest Michigan. That fee will come on top of what consumers pay for the power they actually use, plus other line items on their bills such as charges for maintaining and expanding the power lines.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive buildout of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators. Vistra Corp., which rose as much as 2.7% in early trading Thursday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.6%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion, with shares up 2.7%.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesperson Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. — will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

,Clean Energy ,2025-12-18 14:44:04+00:00,Inside Climate News,How Do Rooftop Solar and EVs Affect Electricity Costs for Everyone Else? Here's a New Estimate,"Dan Gearino, Nicholas Kusnetz",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18122025/inside-clean-energy-rooftop-solar-electricity-rates/,"The larger point is that rooftop solar increases costs for other consumers while EVs lower them; the size of these effects is likely to increase as market share for solar and EVs rises, according to Linn.
He argues that policymakers should understand the amount of the cost shift to make informed decisions when crafting policies related to rooftop solar.
I asked John Farrell, a rooftop solar advocate and co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Relience, to read and respond to the paper.
I think we need to continually monitor how the growth in rooftop solar and EVs will affect the electricity system and the prices paid by other consumers.
To put it another way, the cost shifts linked to rooftop solar are not near the top of my list of problems to be solved right now.","One of the most divisive topics among environmental advocates and researchers is the claim that the growth of rooftop solar leads to a concerning transfer of costs from households that have solar to those that don’t.

Most people who have studied this agree there is some shift in costs, but they disagree on how much and whether it’s too much.

A recent working paper from economists at the University of Maryland offers a novel way of looking at this issue by examining how rooftop solar and electric vehicles affect electricity demand for the population as a whole, and how each contributes to changes in electricity costs for the public as a whole.

The results, I suspect, will be frustrating for solar advocates and encouraging for EV advocates. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

The paper was written by a team that includes Joshua Linn, who teaches economics at the University of Maryland and is a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that studies energy and the environment. As is common for economics research, the authors are gathering feedback and will revise the paper with the aim of publishing a peer-reviewed version.

Linn and his co-authors found that adoption of rooftop solar has led to a 2.35 percent decrease in electricity utilities’ revenue, which the companies have partially recovered by increasing customer rates by 1.48 percent.

Those are small numbers. But they become more significant when the authors zoom in on the effects on low-income households without solar. The upshot is that these households experience, by far, the most significant negative effects, while high-income households have a net benefit because they gain a large share of the cost savings from using rooftop solar.

The authors found that the use of EVs helps to reduce electricity rates for all consumers, with utilities benefitting from a 0.44 percent increase in revenue and consumers a 0.23 decrease in costs.

Again, small numbers. The larger point is that rooftop solar increases costs for other consumers while EVs lower them; the size of these effects is likely to increase as market share for solar and EVs rises, according to Linn.

The analysis looks at electricity consumers as a whole, including some with solar and some with EVs, some with both, and a large majority that have neither.

“When you put solar panels on your home, you’re imposing a cost on somebody else,” Linn said in an interview.

Linn is not suggesting that the costs exceed the environmental benefits. He argues that policymakers should understand the amount of the cost shift to make informed decisions when crafting policies related to rooftop solar.

The authors make clear that their findings should be understood as short-term effects which cover two to three years. So, we cannot extrapolate the effects on rates in a decade or more.

One of my initial reactions was that the findings could be used to justify policies that support the business interests of utility companies. Utilities tend to oppose rooftop solar and want to encourage EVs, and the companies have used their lobbying power to change net metering policies in states such as California, reducing the financial benefits of solar.

Linn said he doesn’t intend to support any industry’s agenda and that this research didn’t receive any corporate funding. His larger concern, he said, was quantifying how solar and EVs affect the roughly 95 percent of consumers who have neither.

I asked John Farrell, a rooftop solar advocate and co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Relience, to read and respond to the paper. His organization views customer-owned energy resources as essential for creating a more equitable economy and counteracting the harm often done by monopoly utilities.

Farrell said that the paper’s focus on short-term effects is a serious flaw because investments in rooftop solar and other energy-saving technologies yield benefits best understood in timelines that are decades long.

“In a short timeframe, my purchase of solar panels or an energy-efficient fridge will reduce demand and (very slightly) increase the necessary rates to recover costs,” he said, in an email. “But over the lifetime of that investment, the utility can reduce supply contracts, defer transformer upgrades, etc.”

His conclusion: “Doing this study is an interesting intellectual exercise but … it loses sight of the forest for the trees.”

I wouldn’t go that far. I think we need to continually monitor how the growth in rooftop solar and EVs will affect the electricity system and the prices paid by other consumers.

It’s worth noting that the cost shifts in the paper appear small relative to the large rate increases that have happened this year as utilities upgrade their systems to accommodate data centers and other large users.

To put it another way, the cost shifts linked to rooftop solar are not near the top of my list of problems to be solved right now. But 10 years from now, following more consumer adoption, it may be a different story.

Powering up One pillar of progress has been growth in renewable energy capacity, for more clean electricity and all the other benefits clean energy brings.
Solar generation January-September was 42% higher than in the same period in 2024, and solar seems poised to overtake coal in the state in 2026.
Even on the water Though the challenges were unprecedented for offshore wind, 2025 also brought noteworthy happenings in that space.
Meanwhile, the first operating large-scale US offshore wind project, serving Long Island, showed strong results in its first year—including in the winter months, when offshore wind power comes in particularly handy.","To claim that 2025 in the United States has been one for the history books may be the understatement of the year. So many unprecedented things have happened, that historians will have no shortage of harrowing lessons to be learned from this era.

In the clean energy space, the Trump administration launched attack after attack to slow down the clean energy in favor of fossil fuels, killing projects, investments, and jobs. By rescinding clean energy funding, pushing to abolish tax credits, coordinating across the administration to interfere with wind and solar, and so much more, they’ve set us up for bitter harvests for years to come.

And yet…

Clean energy is strong. And in 2025, it showed its strength in some really notable ways, as momentum, economics, policies, and people carried clean energy progress forward, despite it all. And it seems all the more important to celebrate it this year.

So, here are clean energy bright spots worthy of resounding cheers.

Powering up

One pillar of progress has been growth in renewable energy capacity, for more clean electricity and all the other benefits clean energy brings. And one clear shining star for 2025 is the US solar sector:

2025 looks set to land just a hair’s breadth away from breaking the record for new US solar installations set in 2024. Texas continued to be the leader in new solar, followed by California and—wait for it—Indiana (up from 15th two years ago). Overall, July to September 2025 was the third best quarter ever for new solar installations.

Solar accounted for almost 80% of new electrical generating capacity through September (and 58% of all new electrical capacity, with energy storage included).

All that installation progress helped push solar electricity to new heights: solar generation from January to September 2025 was 29% higher than in the same period in 2024.

US solar manufacturing also grew: module manufacturing capacity increased 42% over the first three quarters of 2025, new capacity to make the solar cells that go into modules came to life in South Carolina, and new capacity to make the wafers that become the solar cells sprang forth in Michigan.

Energy storage was another fount of progress in 2025, with installations for the year projected to be more than 50% higher than in 2024, led by Texas, California, and Arizona.

All told, says the American Clean Power Association, 2025 looks “firmly on pace to surpass 2024 as the biggest clean power deployment year in history.”

Realizing possibilities

Where solar, storage, and other clean energy technologies really shine is in what they make possible in electricity markets around the country. Some examples:

In California, gas electricity generation has fallen as solar generation has risen, and solar in the state, up 13% year-over-year for the first three quarters of 2025, looked set to surpass gas on an annual basis for the first time.

In Texas, where electricity demand is growing fastest, clean energy played a huge role in meeting that increased demand in 2025. Solar generation January-September was 42% higher than in the same period in 2024, and solar seems poised to overtake coal in the state in 2026. The grid operator covering most of the state reported having added 20 times as much battery, solar, and wind capacity as new gas in its service territory since last winter.

In New England, having clean energy available to meet peaks in electricity demand helped send the region’s last coal plant out to pasture. New England solar generation was almost a fifth higher in Q1-Q3.

Even on the water

Though the challenges were unprecedented for offshore wind, 2025 also brought noteworthy happenings in that space. Construction progressed on the next generation of projects, aimed at serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia, and several large-scale ones should reach full power in 2026 (if I didn’t just jinx it…). In service in Virginia to aid the work is the Charybdis, the brand-new wind turbine installation vessel that is the first built in the United States (Texas). Virginia’s offshore wind project will be one of the world’s largest when completed next year, capable of producing enough energy for more than 600,000 Virginian households.

As some of the Trump administration’s spurious excuses to halt under-construction offshore wind projects failed to stand up to legal scrutiny, the importance of offshore wind for economies—not just as a source of clean electrons—was even clearer than usual in the range of voices pushing back and speaking out in opposition to the administration’s monkeying. Those included labor unions, business networks, and even the Republican member of Congress for the Virginia project staging area and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.

Meanwhile, the first operating large-scale US offshore wind project, serving Long Island, showed strong results in its first year—including in the winter months, when offshore wind power comes in particularly handy. New England too was benefitting from offshore turbines, before the projects themselves even reached completion: injections of electricity into the region’s grid led to wind generation from January to early December 2025 that was 26% higher than in the same period in 2024, and led in mid-December to a record for peak wind production that was 29% higher than 2024’s peak.

Lots more to come

As technology moves forward, so do some leading states. Despite—or because of—the federal moves in the wrong direction, multiple states doubled down on their moves toward a clean energy economy in 2025. Maine, for example, committed to 100% clean electricity by 2040. California extended and strengthened its “cap and invest” program. Illinois passed a comprehensive clean energy package. And, because clean energy matters at all scales, it’s worth celebrating Michigan’s moves to make it easier for customers to connect distributed renewable energy systems (think rooftop solar) to the electric grid, and Utah’s embrace of balcony solar.

And there’s a lot more to come for clean energy, despite the even rougher seas ahead in the near term under this administration. Continuing affordability concerns will guide even some slow-to-come-around people to recognize solar and wind as often the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Decision makers and the rest of us who care about good jobs and economic development will continue to push for more policies to accelerate the move to clean energy. Innovation, economies of scale in products and projects, and continued international progress will all make clean energy even more attractive.

There’s a lot about 2025 I’d really like to be able to undo, or forget. But clean energy’s progress despite all that the Trump administration threw at it is notable, and it seems important to celebrate those accomplishments as we go into the new year. Not least to keep reminding ourselves of the enormity of what’s already possible and what’s yielding dividends right now, today, and will be long into the future.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog-Thumbnail-Solar-panels-walking-men-in-the-middle.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:18.780930

Rising electricity demand, growing reliability pressures and deeper renewable penetration are exposing the limitations of cost-only metrics such as Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”). This paper introduces a value-based framework using two new and complementary measures: Levelized Value of Energy (“LVOE”), which reflects the total value a project can create for its owners, and Levelized Net Benefit (“LNB”), which quantifies the broader value a project can deliver to the overall system. We applied this framework to contrast comparably sized advanced nuclear and solar projects in two separate U.S. power markets - which showed that nuclear, despite a higher LCOE, delivers substantially greater owner and system value. The resulting value difference highlights nuclear’s unpriced contribution to system reliability, fuel savings and long-term cost containment. The findings also challenge the common narrative that nuclear is an expensive option when other, lower-cost solutions are available.1

Grid Pressures Are Driving Renewed Interest in Nuclear

The nuclear energy sector is experiencing a level of momentum that would have seemed improbable just a few years ago. Rapid growth in electricity demand from electrification, digital infrastructure build-out, and industrial re-shoring is intersecting with rising reliability concerns and increasingly severe weather events. These pressures are elevating the importance of firm, clean, long-duration capacity.

In this environment, nuclear is re-emerging through life extensions, restarts and uprates of the existing reactor fleet while advanced reactor developers continue to move through licensing, demonstration and early commercial deployment. Corporate buyers, seeking large scale 24/7 carbon-free electricity, have begun signing long-term agreements for nuclear supply. States are positioning themselves as early hosts for next-generation reactor projects and federal support and financing programs have meaningfully expanded over the last few years. Taken together, these developments reflect a renewed recognition of the growing value of firm, clean resources in meeting future capacity growth and reliability needs, yet our evaluation tools have not kept pace with this shift.

Generation technologies across the industry are typically evaluated using LCOE, a metric developed in an era during which energy was largely interchangeable across hours and seasons. LCOE combines capital costs, operating costs, and energy production into a single dollar-per-megawatt-hour figure.2 It is a simple calculation, familiar and internally consistent as a measure of cost. But it is only a cost metric; it provides no information on the value a resource delivers to the grid.

As renewable penetration has deepened, the economic and reliability value of energy has become far more variable. A firm megawatt-hour delivered during a strained evening peak or a weather-driven emergency has a fundamentally different value than a solar megawatt-hour delivered during midday conditions when supply is abundant.

Today’s planning problem is not simply finding the lowest-cost marginal megawatt-hour but designing portfolios that deliver the required reliability and decarbonization outcomes at the lowest system cost.3 That distinction is at the heart of the nuclear value gap — the difference between the total value that nuclear provides to a system and the amount of value that it can capture through current energy market structures.

The Value Gap: From Cost to System Benefit

LCOE was an effective screening tool when grids were dominated by thermal generation; renewable penetration was modest and intraday variability was limited. In that context, the timing, flexibility and duration of output mattered far less for system cost and reliability than they do today. In the contemporary grid, several structural shifts undermine the usefulness of simple cost-only metrics such as LCOE:

Temporal value divergence: Energy value now varies sharply by hour and season, and capture prices depend heavily on when a resource generates.

Adequacy and resilience constraints: More frequent and deeper stress events make firm, multi-day availability increasingly critical for reliability.

Divergent lifetimes: Nuclear and hydro operate for 60+ years, while solar and wind require multiple reinvestments, creating very different long-term system costs.

FTI Consulting Introduces Two Related Value-Based Metrics: LVOE and LNB

To address these gaps, consider two new metrics: LVOE and LNB. The first metric, LVOE, measures the net economic value a project owner can capture for each megawatt hour (“MWh”) produced over the full life of a plant. Like LCOE, it uses a standard levelizing approach: all future cash flows are discounted to present value and divided by the plant’s discounted lifetime generation.

The key difference between LVOE and LCOE is that LVOE adds revenue instead of totaling costs. It incorporates all monetized value streams a project can earn (energy sales, capacity payments, ancillary services and, where applicable, carbon credits) and subtracts the full set of project costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, fuel, refurbishment cycles and decommissioning. In effect, LVOE is the value-based counterpart to LCOE. While LCOE shows what a resource costs per MWh, LVOE shows the net value a project can realize per MWh under current and future market structures.

The second metric, LNB, measures the discounted net economic benefit of a plant to the system. LNB starts with LVOE and adds quantified system-wide cost reductions not compensated in markets, including avoided investment in additional capacity and avoided system fuel costs. Because retail rates are ultimately driven by total system costs rather than the LCOE of individual resources, LNB provides the metric most linked to long-term rate impacts.

The difference between LNB and LVOE, is the unpriced value. A technology (such as solar) that is fully compensated for the value it delivers will show minimal difference between LVOE and LNB. In contrast, nuclear delivers significant reliability, adequacy, and system cost reductions beyond the compensation it receives.

These types of metrics have not historically been part of standard practice. FTI’s novel approach and modeling capabilities now enable credible, technology-specific valuation of both project revenues and system benefits.

Our Methodology and Modeling Approach

To evaluate nuclear’s value relative to solar on a consistent basis, we combine long-term market modeling with project-level financial analysis. For the market modeling, we use PLEXOS,® a commercial optimization platform widely employed by utilities, system operators and regulators for capacity expansion and production cost modeling.

The PLEXOS® model runs on an internally maintained U.S. zonal dataset that includes updated demand projections, existing fleet characteristics and retirements, technology cost trajectories, fuel price paths, transmission constraints and applicable policy requirements. PLEXOS® produces long-term investment outcomes and hourly dispatch results under reliability and resource constraints.

Technology cost and performance assumptions are drawn from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Annual Technology Baseline.4

Figure 1: Overview of Our Cost and Value Modeling Approach

The nuclear case reflects a representative 1 gigawatt (“GW”) advanced reactor, modeled with a multi-year construction profile, major refurbishment cycles, and a 60-year operating life. The comparison case is a utility-scale solar portfolio sized to match the nuclear plant’s total 60-year energy production, including full rebuilds in years 20 and 40.

For our comparison, we selected the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”), the independent system operator for most of Texas, and PJM, a large regional transmission organization spanning multiple Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states, because ERCOT and PJM represent two of the most important (and contrasting) power market structures in the U.S. ERCOT is a large, energy-only, predominantly merchant market with high renewable penetration, making it a natural test bed for how new firm resources compete on price and system value. PJM, by contrast, combines an energy market with a robust capacity market, operates under tighter regulatory oversight and faces strong decarbonization and reliability pressures alongside growing renewables. These systems are both expected to see sustained long-term electric demand growth, so insights from ERCOT and PJM are especially relevant for future energy generation investment and planning decisions.

All metrics in our comparison are expressed in real dollars using discount rates aligned with the LCOE inputs (6% real for nuclear and 3% real for solar), reflecting differences in financing assumptions and technology risk. We focus on two contrasting regions: ERCOT, an energy-only market with high renewable penetration and weather-driven stress events, and PJM, a capacity-market region with a more diversified resource mix and distinct policy dynamics, using a capacity price assumption of $250/megawatt per day.5

Our analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we use PLEXOS® to generate technology-specific hourly prices, captured energy revenues, curtailment and capacity contributions for each region under decarbonizing system conditions. Second, we combine these outputs with cost profiles in our detailed project finance model to compute discounted cash flows and derive LCOE and LVOE for an illustrative 1 GW plant; although illustrative, the results reflect realistic operational and market outcomes. Third, we calculate system-wide avoided costs (primarily foregone gas peaker capital expenditures and lower system fuel operating expenditures) by comparing scenarios with and without the 1 GW nuclear unit.6 We then convert these avoided costs into a discounted per-MWh value and add that number to LVOE to produce LNB.

To reflect climate policy considerations, we compute carbon value at an illustrative $30/ton carbon dioxide (“CO₂”).7 This represents the avoided emissions benefit of nuclear — valued at $30 for every ton of CO₂ displaced relative to a gas generator in a base case. The results of this modeling framework are summarized below for both ERCOT and PJM.

Results: Comparing Nuclear and Solar Across Cost and Value Metrics

A traditional LCOE comparison produces the expected outcome: solar appears less expensive than nuclear on a cost-per-MWh basis in both ERCOT and PJM. This reflects the lower upfront capital cost of solar, but it does not account for differences in timing, durability or reliability.

Figure 2: Solar and Nuclear LCOE Comparison in ERCOT and PJM8

However, once we evaluate monetized net value using LVOE, the comparison shifts. Nuclear generates materially higher owner-level net value per MWh than solar in both regions, driven by its high captured energy value during peak and scarcity times, its firm capacity contribution and its long-lived production profile that avoids multiple reinvestment cycles. The solar LVOE is lower because its captured prices decline with penetration, its effective load carrying capability falls sharply over time and it requires full rebuilds to maintain output over the 60-year period.

Figure 3: Solar and Nuclear LVOE Comparison in ERCOT and PJM9

When we incorporate unpriced system benefits, the divergence becomes even more pronounced. Nuclear reduces the need for additional peaking capacity, lowers system fuel consumption and improves reliability during stressed conditions. These avoided costs materially increase the nuclear LNB. In contrast, the solar LNB is essentially identical to its LVOE because most of its contribution is already monetized in existing market structures, and its integration needs to offset remaining system benefits.

Figure 4: Breakdown of Nuclear Value Components (LVOE to LNB)

The resulting value gap (unpriced system value) captures nuclear’s unpriced contribution to the grid, including long-duration firm capacity, extreme-weather resilience and avoided system expenditures. This gap explains why nuclear can lower long-term system costs even with a higher LCOE, whereas solar’s low LCOE does not automatically translate into lower system costs once firming, storage and integration needs are considered. Put simply: rates follow system cost, not project cost — and nuclear lowers system cost.

Even a modest carbon price further widens this gap, adding meaningful value to nuclear, which can accrue either to the project (through credits) or to the system (through avoided emissions). In Figure 4, the carbon value is included in the LNB figures for simplicity and completeness. Although carbon is not the driver of the results, it reinforces the conclusion: cost-only metrics understate the total value that nuclear provides.

Implications for Developers, Investors, Utilities and Policymakers

This novel LVOE and LNB approach highlight several important implications for stakeholders across the nuclear value chain and broader energy system.

For developers and technology vendors, the findings support commercial strategy and business development efforts by better quantifying the full nuclear value proposition. Demonstrating avoided system costs, resilience benefits and long-lived output enables developers to communicate a clearer, more compelling case to customers and regulators, moving beyond cost-only comparisons toward a value-centered narrative.

For investors and project owners, the analysis provides improved visibility into project economics under realistic market and dispatch conditions. A better understanding of the unpriced system value can inform discussions on commercial structuring, risk allocation and long-term contracting approaches. At a time when investors are starting to express concerns that nuclear could be the next “bubble,” this clarity can help unlock additional capital by aligning project economics with the value nuclear provides to the system.

For utilities and large energy buyers, LVOE and LNB provide clearer visibility into both project-level value and system-level benefits. These metrics help identify how firm, clean resources contribute to overall portfolio performance, reliability and long-term cost trajectories. By understanding the full value delivered by each resource (not just its cost), utilities and buyers can make more informed portfolio choices, balance reliability and decarbonization goals, and avoid future system costs associated with firming, storage and adequacy requirements.

For policymakers and system operators, this approach provides clearer insight into the system value that nuclear can deliver and how it shapes long-term cost trajectories. By quantifying LVOE and LNB, the framework helps inform integrated resource planning efforts, regulatory design and energy policy decisions that recognize resources that reduce future spending on capacity, fuel and integration. This is particularly important today as state governments are increasingly reviewing prior energy policy decisions and their impacts on ratepayers. Incorporating these insights can support more efficient planning, strengthen reliability and ultimately help moderate long-term rate pressures.

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cost-only comparisons are no longer sufficient — durable, least-cost outcomes emerge only when both monetized and unpriced system value are fully reflected in investment, planning and policy decisions.

Summer site in Jenkinsville. PwC’s assessment concludes that the project would generate billions in economic activity during construction and sustain thousands of high-skill jobs once operational.

Construction Phase Drives Near-Term Economic Impact

According to PwC, the seven-year construction period—expected to run from 2026 through 2032—would contribute an estimated $7.3 billion to South Carolina’s gross domestic product. During this phase, the project would support an average of approximately 7,300 jobs annually, totaling more than 51,000 person-years of employment across engineering, manufacturing, construction, and project management roles.

Labor income during construction is projected at $4.1 billion statewide, with tax revenues reaching approximately $1.6 billion when federal, state, and local impacts are included. PwC notes that leveraging the existing partially built infrastructure at V.C. Summer significantly reduces both construction costs and deployment timelines compared with greenfield nuclear projects.

Beyond South Carolina, the national economic footprint during construction would be even larger. PwC estimates $13.8 billion in U.S. GDP and nearly 13,000 jobs supported annually across the broader supply chain, underscoring the project’s relevance to domestic manufacturing and industrial policy objectives.

Long-Term Operations Deliver Sustained Employment

Once operational, the two AP1000 units would provide approximately 2,300 megawatts of nuclear capacity—enough to power at least 1.5 million homes in South Carolina. PwC projects that ongoing plant operations would generate $1.6 billion in annual state GDP and support roughly 2,700 jobs each year over a minimum operating life of 80 years.

Cumulatively, long-term operations are estimated to produce more than $130 billion in state GDP, alongside $30 billion in labor income and $31 billion in tax revenues. Nationally, operational impacts would reach $2.1 billion in annual GDP and support approximately 3,700 jobs across the U.S. economy.

Workforce Development and Nuclear Cluster Effects

PwC’s analysis emphasizes that economic impacts extend beyond direct employment. The project would require approximately 1,000 permanent, highly skilled workers onsite, including engineers, nuclear technicians, chemists, and operations specialists. Westinghouse plans to invest heavily in workforce training and partnerships with educational institutions to ensure a qualified labor pipeline.

South Carolina already hosts a significant nuclear energy cluster, employing more than 16,000 workers statewide. Completing the V.C. Summer reactors would reinforce this ecosystem, strengthening supplier networks, attracting related industries, and anchoring advanced energy skills in the region.

Infrastructure, Grid Reliability, and Policy Context

The report situates the V.C. Summer restart within broader national energy policy trends. The project aligns with federal efforts to expand nuclear capacity as a tool for grid reliability, energy security, and industrial competitiveness. The AP1000 technology is currently the only Generation III+ reactor operating commercially with fully passive safety systems and an established global deployment track record.

With electricity demand rising from data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification, the analysis frames large-scale nuclear projects as foundational infrastructure rather than standalone generation assets. By reactivating a partially completed site, South Carolina could accelerate deployment while minimizing land use and construction risk relative to new builds.

A Long-Horizon Infrastructure Decision

PwC’s findings present the V.C. Summer restart as a multi-decade infrastructure investment with implications well beyond short-term job creation. The combination of construction-phase stimulus, long-term operational employment, and grid-scale carbon-free power positions the project as both an economic development and energy resilience strategy for the state.

While final investment and regulatory decisions remain ahead, the report concludes that completing the two AP1000 units would represent one of the most consequential energy infrastructure investments in South Carolina in decades—one with measurable impacts on jobs, GDP, and the future structure of the state’s power system.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251217-113218-54e-Gen%20III%2B%20AP1000%20reactor.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:03.855842

Consequently, numerous companies have developed VPP programmes, which frequently offer solar or battery systems at no cost or a reduced price in exchange for leveraging these systems to help maintain grid frequency and reliability.

Energy-Storage.news looks at recent news from Sunrun and NRG Energy, Haven Energy, and Leap and Enel North America as the companies advance VPP programmes across the US.

Sunrun and NRG partner to provide residential storage in Texas

US residential solar and energy storage installer Sunrun and energy supplier NRG Energy have announced a multi-year partnership aimed at accelerating residential energy storage in Texas.

Texas residents will have access to a home energy solution that combines Sunrun’s solar-plus-storage systems with “optimised rate plans and smart battery programming,” provided by NRG Energy’s retail electricity provider, Reliant.

As new and existing Sunrun customers sign up with Reliant, the total capacity will be leveraged to address the rising demand in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market.

The companies will collaborate to develop offers that aggregate and dispatch distributed power assets, supplying electricity to Texas’s grid during peak demand times. Sunrun will receive payment for aggregating capacity, while Reliant customers who participate will be compensated by Sunrun for sharing their stored solar energy.

In November, Sunrun reported a revenue of US$724.6 million for the third quarter of this year, as the company pursued its “storage-first strategy”.

Sunrun has achieved its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth. The company’s revenue rose from US$569 million in the previous quarter, and the Q3 figure reflects a 35% year-over-year increase compared to US$537.2 million in Q3 2024.

The company also took part in California’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) distributed storage programme. During a test on 29 July, DSGS helped lower the net load on the state’s grid. However, shortly afterwards, California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office reduced the programme’s funding.

In May, VPP provider Sonnen collaborated with Abundance Energy and Energywell Technology Licensing to create a battery-enabled VPP in Texas. This VPP enables Abundance Energy customers to utilise sonnenConnect residential battery systems to enhance grid stability and reduce electricity expenses.

Haven Energy secures US$40 million to expand VPP networks

Haven Energy, a home battery systems company, has raised US$40 million to boost its partnerships with utility companies and community choice aggregators (CCAs). The funds will allow expansion of its leasing model, enhance its Channel Partner Programme for local installers, and support the ongoing development of “one of the nation’s largest VPP networks.”

The US$40 million comprises an equity round led by Giant Ventures and a debt facility from Turtle Hill, with further equity investments from California Infrastructure Bank, Carnrite Ventures, Chaac Ventures, Comcast Ventures, and Lerer Hippeau.

Haven states that US energy demand is expected to increase by 15% by 2030, growing faster than new generation and transmission infrastructure can be developed. This will lead to higher costs, increased outages, and greater pressure on the grid.

The company states it is tackling this challenge by working with utilities to install home solar and battery systems for its customers. These DERs provide utilities with flexible, local capacity that enhances the grid’s stability and contributes to lowering energy costs.

Haven also claims it has installed over 10MW of distributed capacity with more than 50MW in development for 2026, with over US$75 million worth of projects in its pipeline.

This capacity underpins both Haven’s expanding VPP and the utility-run programs that Haven develops for its utility partners. Current partners include Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Clean Power Alliance (CPA), San Jose Clean Energy (SJCE), Clean Energy Alliance (CEA), and Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE).

The funding will also facilitate the growth of Haven’s leasing model and Channel Partner Programme. This programme allows trusted local installers to provide Haven’s solar and battery solutions directly to homeowners and incorporate these installations into the company’s VPP. Haven handles financing, operations, and performance, allowing installers to focus on installation.

In June, Haven and CEA collaborated to offer California homeowners BESS without any purchase or installation expenses. The Battery Bonus Connect programme will serve around 300 homeowners and is financed through California’s US$280 million Self-Generation Incentive Program Residential Solar & Storage Equity (SGIP RSSE) initiative.

Leap and Enel partner on nationwide VPP growth

Leap, a software provider for aggregating DERs, and independent power producer (IPP) Enel North America have announced a partnership to expand the connection of commercial and industrial (C&I) DERs to utility demand response programmes across the country.

Together, Enel and Leap will utilise existing C&I capacity on the grid to manage energy demand in real time across Enel’s utility network, while generating additional revenue for Leap’s C&I partners.

The collaboration will start with three utility programmes managed by Enel in Washington, Arizona, and the Tennessee Valley, and will gradually expand to other markets nationwide.

Enel states that collaborating with Leap enables the company to rapidly increase capacity enrollment in its demand response programmes, while offering C&I customers new opportunities to generate revenue by aiding grid stability.

Leap, meanwhile, sees a wider expansion into vertically integrated utility markets, offering its technology partners additional revenue opportunities for the C&I resources the company sells and manages.

In February, Leap announced its expansion into the PJM Interconnection wholesale market. PJM, a regional transmission organisation (RTO), manages the flow of electricity across parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

Leap’s software enables customer devices within the PJM region to automatically modify energy consumption to help stabilise the grid during emergencies.

The work relates to Phase One of the Lionheart development, located in the Upper Rhine Valley, a region with significant geothermal potential that underpins Vulcan Energy’s integrated renewable lithium production model.

The Lionheart Project is designed to combine renewable energy generation with lithium extraction and downstream processing. Once operational, the project will supply battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) to the European electric vehicle sector, supporting regional battery manufacturing and reducing reliance on imported raw materials. At full Phase One capacity, Lionheart is expected to produce approximately 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate annually—sufficient to support the production of around 500,000 electric vehicles each year. In parallel, the integrated system will generate about 275 GWh of renewable electricity and 560 GWh of renewable heat, reinforcing the project’s low-carbon credentials.

Under three separate contracts with a combined value of €46 million, ABB will act as the main electrical contractor for the project. Its responsibilities span the entire electrical scope, including detailed design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, and final delivery of critical electrical systems. The contracts cover multiple facilities central to the Lionheart value chain, including the lithium extraction plant in Landau, the central lithium processing facility at Industriepark Höchst, as well as associated geothermal well sites distributed across the Upper Rhine Valley.

The electrification package encompasses high-, medium-, and low-voltage distribution systems, transformers, variable speed drives, uninterruptible power supplies, and advanced protection equipment. Together, these components will ensure a stable, reliable, and efficient supply of electricity, distributing power seamlessly from the regional 110 kV grid down to individual process units and building-level operations. This robust electrical backbone is essential to maintaining continuous production and meeting the stringent quality requirements for battery-grade lithium products.

The latest contracts build on a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two companies in April 2024. That agreement aimed to simplify engineering workflows and strengthen project execution by aligning design optimization, supply-chain coordination, and cost performance. By formalizing this collaboration, the partners are laying the groundwork for what is expected to become Europe’s first fully integrated renewable lithium operation.

Senior executives from both sides emphasized the broader strategic importance of the project. ABB highlighted Lionheart as a model for how clean energy systems and advanced electrification can be combined to strengthen Europe’s battery materials supply chain at a time of rapidly growing electric vehicle demand. Vulcan Energy, meanwhile, underlined the importance of reliable, scalable electrical systems in enabling industrial-scale lithium production while keeping emissions low and supporting supply chain decarbonization.

The execution of these contracts is also a key condition for project financing. Vulcan Energy has indicated that it is targeting financial close, along with the completion of additional project and financing agreements, in the fourth quarter of 2025. Once finalized, the Lionheart Project is expected to play a pivotal role in supporting Europe’s transition to clean mobility through locally produced, low-carbon lithium.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:51.515689

This Market Intel is a special policy analysis on the recently proposed waters of the United States rule.

Key Takeaways:

For decades, the definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act has been unclear, leading to regulatory uncertainty. Five rule changes since 2015 and conflicting court decisions created a “ping-pong” effect, leaving farmers unsure which water features on their land fall under federal jurisdiction.

In their ruling in Sackett v. EPA, the Supreme Court eliminated the “significant nexus” test, which broadened the federal government’s jurisdictional reach. The ruling clarified that only relatively permanent waters and wetlands with a continuous surface connection to regulated waters fall under federal jurisdiction. This decision was widely praised for providing the clearest legal standard in decades.

The Trump administration’s proposed WOTUS rule adopts Sackett’s framework, excluding isolated ponds, disconnected wetlands, and most ditches. It shifts the burden of proof from landowners to the federal government and allows states to regulate beyond federal standards. While the rule aims for clarity, challenges remain — such as proving sustained flow during wet seasons.

For years, farmers and ranchers have worked their land with a close eye on the weather, volatile markets, farm policy and the many regulations that shape everyday business decisions. Among the most influential, and often most confusing of these rules, is the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). Over the past decade, frequent regulatory changes and court decisions have left many farmers questioning what WOTUS really means for their operations. From the start of this debate, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been the leading voice across industry sectors, consistently advocating for clear, practical regulations that protect farmers while ensuring environmental stewardship.

The Evolving Definition of WOTUS

Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), the term WOTUS serves as the threshold that determines which water bodies fall under federal jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the statute offers little clarity on where that jurisdictional line should be drawn. Over the years, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the agencies) have exploited this ambiguity, expanding their authority far beyond what Congress intended when drafting the law.

From the mid-1980s onward, the agencies operated under a regulatory definition that broadly interpreted WOTUS to include many waters. This expansive interpretation repeatedly ran up against judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court’s decisions on the limits of the federal government’s regulatory reach, in cases such as Riverside Bayview Homes, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, and Rapanos, often created more questions than answers.

For example, the Supreme Court’s 4-1-4 split in Rapanos created conflicting standards for federal jurisdiction. Justice Scalia’s plurality introduced the “relatively permanent waters” test, while Justice Kennedy’s concurrence advanced the “significant nexus” test. With no majority opinion, this fractured guidance left regulators and courts without a clear rule, fueling years of litigation and inconsistent interpretations as successive administrations struggled to define WOTUS.

Beginning in 2015, the regulatory uncertainty was exacerbated as different presidential administrations attempted to make sweeping changes, creating a swinging pendulum of regulations. Consequently, the definition of WOTUS became a legal and regulatory maze — one in which wetlands, ditches, seasonal streams, drainage features or even ephemeral streams (low spots in a farm field) could be regulated. Over the last decade, there have been five different rulemakings on WOTUS. The ping-ponging of definitions has produced anxiety and uncertainty for farmers and ranchers whose decisions on the farm depend heavily on clear rules.

Sackett v. EPA: A Turning Point for WOTUS Clarity and Certainty

The 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA marked one of the most consequential shifts in federal water regulations since the passage of the CWA. This decision greatly narrowed the types of water features and wetlands regulated as a WOTUS and simplified compliance for landowners. The Supreme Court accomplished this by unanimously eliminating the troubling “significant nexus” test, which allowed the federal government to set up a case-by-case regulatory regime that expanded their jurisdictional reach beyond legal boundaries.

Additionally, the ruling greatly restricted the types of wetlands that fall under federal authority by providing proper guardrails for “adjacent wetland.” Farmers and ranchers across the country praised the Court’s decision because it is the clearest, most decisive legal standard for WOTUS in decades and appropriately reigns in the federal government’s authority.

Understanding the Proposed WOTUS Rule

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA. The rule represents the greatest narrowing of the federal government’s jurisdictional reach over private property. As directed by the Supreme Court, the proposal only regulates water bodies that are “relatively permanent” — meaning surface waters that flow or stand year-round or those that flow throughout the wet season — and wetlands that are directly abutting a regulated tributary and have a continuous surface connection.

As an example, features like isolated ponds, field-edge depressions, disconnected wetlands, groundwater and many ditches or prior-converted cropland would be excluded. The rule also proposes to define key terms (like “tributary,” “ditch,” “prior converted cropland,” etc.) to bring consistency and predictability to what is “in” and what is “out.” This also reduces the amount of land subject to the regulation, cutting down regulatory costs across the industry.

Most importantly, this rule shifts the burden of proof away from the landowner and places this responsibility squarely on the federal government, meaning a farmer no longer must prove that they do not have a WOTUS on their property to use their land.

It is critical to recognize that this rule upholds the cooperative federalism objective of the CWA by allowing states to serve as the primary authority in regulating water. State governments can regulate far beyond the definition of WOTUS and impose their own, more stringent rules. In many states, just because a water feature is not regulated by the federal government, does not necessarily mean that it goes unregulated.

While this rule is an important step forward in creating a legally durable definition of WOTUS, implementation of the rule may present some challenges. One potential hurdle for some landowners will be determining if there is sustained flow throughout the wet season. In some instances, field-level data may need to be collected, which could significantly slow down the jurisdictional determination process. This also impedes farmers’ ability to use their land, potentially cutting their production and revenue capacity.

The Cost of Compliance

Ensuring compliance under WOTUS for farmers can include several major components that impact a farmer’s cost of production:

Obtaining Clean Water Act federal permits for activities like fencing, drainage or pond construction;

Hiring consultants and technical experts for wetland determinations;

Experiencing operational delays while waiting for permit approvals; and

The cost of mitigation activities which can often be substantial.

Because Clean Water Act compliance carries significant civil and criminal liabilities — up to $64,000 per day or even jail time — it is critical that farmers fully understand the rules to avoid inadvertent violations.

How WOTUS Shapes Everyday Farm Decisions

Farmers care about the definition of WOTUS because it determines which ditches, wetlands and water features on their land fall under federal regulation — and therefore which everyday activities may require permits, carry compliance obligations or expose them to legal risk and regulatory costs to ensure compliance.

Opponents of the plan warned that it puts existing ratepayers -- including residents and large companies -- at risk of higher electricity costs. The policy approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission comes in the wake of projects like Meta's $27 billion data center announced last year and a facility for Anthropic announced Wednesday.

Gov. Jeff Landry's ""Lightning Speed"" executive order to reduce red tape inspired the new amendment. Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan proposed the initiative as a way to ""accelerate the timelines required for major employers to invest, build and grow in Louisiana.""

""We have been last in so many things for far too long and we're seeing some material success in growth across sectors,"" Coussan said at the commission's monthly meeting.

This change will exempt utilities trying to build new infrastructure for data centers from going through a process that requires them to prove the new generation is the cheapest and most reliable option on the market. It also directs the regulators to vote on new projects within eight months of an application, faster than the typical yearlong timeline.

In order for a project to qualify for the streamlined process, a company must meet requirements including a letter from the state's economic development agency ""confirming the customer's interest and the importance of power availability"" and a contract of at least 15 years.

The amendment passed by a 4-1 vote, with only Commissioner Davante Lewis opposing. Lewis called the new policy a ""dangerous precedent"" that ""lowers the standards"" for projects trying to get new infrastructure on the grid. He noted that the new policy criteria are less stringent than the power plan approved for Meta, a monthslong regulatory process that faced significant pushback from environmental, consumer and industrial groups.

Meta's northeast Louisiana data center, the company's biggest yet, will require roughly three times the amount of electricity that New Orleans uses on an annual basis. Entergy is building three new gas-fired power plants to meet the demand.

The commission meeting grew tense at times, with commissioners talking over and interrupting each other.

What's the new rule?

A utility can go through the fast-tracked ""lightning"" route as long as the customer pays for half of its infrastructure costs, the new rule stipulates. Meta, for instance, is paying for the full annual revenue of the electricity plants that will power the facility, though not for all of the new infrastructure needed.

Lewis was the only commissioner to vote against the plan for Meta's center, on the grounds that the agreement left fundamental questions on the table, including the lack of a competitive bid process. On Wednesday, he proposed a separate framework to address issues that large-scale data centers are presenting to regulators.

That proposal aims to ""ensure that the public interest is considered in a transparent and deliberative process, while balancing economic development, improving grid reliability, and protecting affordable rates."" It was deferred to the next commission meeting, with all four of the other regulators voting to delay.

'Decades of sharply increasing bills'

Advocacy groups opposed Coussan's proposal, arguing that the policy removes needed guardrails and fails to give regulators enough time to assess the impact of future projects. Logan Burke, who runs the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said that removing protections will mean ""decades of sharply increasing bills.""

""Understanding the amount of pressure that you are receiving from other elected bodies, but you are five duly elected decision makers who get to make these decisions,"" Burke said.

A coalition of some of the largest industrial users in the state, including chemical manufacturers and oil companies, also objected to key aspects of the new policy. Randy Young, a lawyer for the Louisiana Energy Users Group, wrote a letter to the regulators earlier this week saying that waiving the typical regulatory process ""adds significant risk and potential costs to the ratepayers.""

Regarding the Meta deal, Entergy says the new power plants will not lead to higher bills for average ratepayers.

For Buckingham, the investment the United States is making into the mining of these materials will be well worth the initial costs.","SERRA BLANCA, Texas (NewsNation) — An otherwise nondescript mountainside in West Texas could be part of the Trump administration’s solution to ending the United States’ reliance on countries like China for rare-earth materials that are essential to building missiles, fighter jets and technology.

NewsNation received an exclusive look at one key location that is being targeted for mining these rare materials. Locating these minerals could provide the United States with economic independence from China. Officials have gone as far as characterizing the issue as a matter of national security and say that mining operations could begin as early as 2028.

The Trump administration has announced plans to launch a coalition of partners on Friday, when the Pax Silica Declaration will be signed. The pact will unite Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Israel and is designed to address deficits in critical minerals access, which will edge out China’s massive investment in its critical minerals and tech sector, officials say.

Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have been instrumental in China’s restriction of exports of rare-earth materials to the United States. Meanwhile, Trump has struck deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan.

The Guardian recently reported that the United States and China have brokered a trade truce on rare-earth materials. However, China currently controls about 70% of global mining and more than 90% of global processing capacity. That has put the U.S. behind the 8-ball in trying to source more of these materials in places like Round Top Mountain in West Texas.

It has also allowed China to take control of the rare-earth supply chain and being able to manipulate geopolitical markets that the United States is now attempting to tap into. But to do so, work must be done to ensure the U.S. has enough natural resources at its disposal to make the kind of dent it is seeking to create.

“China has a corner on this market,” Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham told NewsNation. “We think this is the only and largest complete set of rare earth minerals not under China’s control in the world. These are important for our jets to fly. It’s national security. It’s everyday convenience. It’s taking away this economic play from China.”

To accomplish that, more mining is expected to take place in locations like Round Top Mountain, where Dysprosium and Terbium, which are two critical rare-earth materials. Dysprosium is valued largely for its magnetic properties, which are used primarily in everyday electronics like smartphones and speakers, but also in defense systems.

Terbium, meanwhile, is another rare-earth material that is known for its bright green luminescence, which is used for lighting displays and high-performance magnets for electronics such as wind turbines, electric vehicles and sonar systems.

Buckingham says that Round Top Mountain is one of the most unique mining sites in the country. Inside the mountain, 17 rare-earth materials can be found that will be critical in helping eliminate China’s monopoly on the rare-earth market. All of the land where these materials can be found is state-owned but is then leased to mining companies such as USA Rare Earth.

Alex Moyes, the company’s vice president of mining, told NewsNation that the company has already conducted smaller-scale pilot programs that are helping locate rare-earth materials. He said that the magnets that are made from these valuable materials are critical in national security. For example, magnets are used in missile motors and to control the steering capabilities of the missile.

“So, if all of a sudden the magnet that’s steering your guided missile demagnetizes, you no longer have control of where your missile’s going to go,” Moyes told NewsNation.

Initially, the cost to mine these materials from the earth may be more expensive than paying for those in China. However, in time, the costs will drop as the supply chain scales and the U.S. conducts more rare-earth business with countries with which it has struck deals. For Buckingham, the investment the United States is making into the mining of these materials will be well worth the initial costs.

“(It’s about) our energy independence — that elemental independence — making sure our jets can fly, our missiles can work, our phones function, everything we need to educate our children,” Buckingham said. “It’s important to invest in America.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/12/snapshot-4-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-18 12:00:36.740362

DOE has issued emergency orders to keep coal plants from retiring, part of its focus on fossil fuels. And it’s pushing to expand the data center boom.

“It’s been a massive swing,” said Tom Pyle, president of the fossil-fuel-supporting, free-market group American Energy Alliance.

In a heavily divided nation, the Trump agenda at DOE is triggering applause from conservatives and fossil fuel supporters and consternation among environmentalists. Climate activists and public health advocates say the DOE under Wright is advancing policies that raise energy prices and expose Americans to harmful pollution tied to fossil fuel emissions.

“Chris Wright has fully embraced Donald Trump’s war on renewables, and that’s extremely significant,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program. “Almost on a weekly basis, Secretary Wright posts social media content from his official government accounts spreading complete misinformation and lies about renewable energy and particularly about solar.”

Wright himself is a major change-maker in the federal government and energy world. As a former CEO of fracking services company Liberty Energy, Wright is steeped in data on energy systems and a frequent guest on media outlets like Fox News. At an event last week, Trump called Wright the “greatest oil man anywhere in the world.”

Despite some apparent rifts with the White House of late, including the firing of a top DOE official closely tied to Trump world, conservatives are fully behind Wright.

“Secretary Wright is just a really, really knowledgeable person. He’s extremely well qualified for this job,” said Pyle.

Heading into the next year, many questions remain about how the Trump administration intends to execute its energy policy: What specific loans will be offered to energy companies? How many more billions of dollars might be cut from Biden-era projects?

All of these questions come as electricity demand is projected to increase dramatically, along with utility bills for everyday Americans.

DOE did not respond to requests for comment.

Are the changes durable?

Some of the changes at DOE under Wright are likely to have a short shelf life if a new Democratic administration takes power, including the renaming and shuffling of offices. Other changes could have more staying power.

Critics of the administration say the layoffs and grant cuts, more of which could be in the offing over the coming months, will cause companies and American workers to think twice about teaming up with the federal government in the future.

“I had convinced a bunch of people to go into the department, who then all got fired and now say they would never go back to work for the federal government. So that, I think, is a huge loss,” said Kate Gordon, CEO of the non-profit California Forward and a former adviser to Secretary Jennifer Granholm under Biden. “It might be generational. We worked incredibly hard in the administration to try to make it exciting for people to go into government. It’s hard to do.”

Staffing cuts will also have “long-term consequences” because of the large amounts of money the department is tasked with moving out the door, said Alex Kizer, an executive vice president at the EFI Foundation and a former DOE staffer during the Obama administration.

It’s unclear if DOE will aim to address the staffing crunch with contractors or new hires with specific skill sets, he said.

The administration’s push to add dramatically more power to the electricity grid could also have staying power.

“Now everyone is talking about the need for more energy for AI and to stay ahead of China,” said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation. “I think that that is going to stick with people because that seems to be nonpartisan. Everyone wants us to have the best AI and data centers. Both parties want us to stay ahead of China in that.”

Reorganization and funding cuts

A reorganization last month at DOE moved the decades-old Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to a new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation. It also cut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which was created by Congress in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, and renamed the Loan Programs Office the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.

Gordon said the cut to OCED and grant cancellations, most of which stem from the infrastructure law, flout U.S. laws.

“We organized partly around deployment, which is something that the agency didn’t do. Trump just got rid of that [OCED], which I don’t think is allowed because it was created in a bill by Congress. But what does ‘it’s not allowed’ mean anymore?” she said. “What we’re seeing now is just a complete separation of the executive from the will of Congress and that is a very strange and disturbing thing to see.”

Some changes could be reversed easily in the future, considering that Biden and the first Trump administration also reorganized offices.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a megalaw signed by Trump in July, rescinded the “unobligated balances” of Inflation Reduction Act funding for the OCED, along with other programs at DOE. The administration’s supporters say that paved the way for DOE to retool priorities.

“I don’t think the department should be in the business of deployment. It should be in the business of research and development,” said Pyle, referencing DOE’s historic R&D role in energy development.

Jessie Stolark, executive director at the Carbon Capture Coalition, said from the group’s understanding, “under the recent DOE reorganization, unspent OCED funds are being reprogrammed to other offices within the department.”

Claire Cody, an analyst at Clean Tomorrow who worked at DOE earlier this year, said parts of OCED will likely be split up, although the office was authorized as a distinct entity. “We’ll have to see what Congress does about that,” she said.

Typically, deobligated funds are returned to the Treasury if they are not being challenged by affected companies, but there are restrictions on how they can be reused. For example, DOE is supposed to only reobligate funds that are still within their appropriation window and that are tapped for their original statutory purpose directed by Congress.

Kizer said he suspected that billions of dollars of funding could be reprogrammed by the Trump administration, but it is a “big area of uncertainty.”

Efficiency no more

DOE is proposing to roll back dozens of regulations, including a laundry list of appliance efficiency rules, which force manufacturers to sell products that use less energy. Lawsuits on the efficiency rollbacks are expected once DOE issues finalized rules.

The Trump administration also proposed cutting the Weatherization Assistance Program, a 50-year-old initiative that subsidizes equipment efficiency upgrades for low-income households, while EPA is waffling on whether to continue Energy Star, a program that certifies efficient household equipment and buildings.

Meanwhile, the OBBB cut tax credits for homeowner efficiency upgrades. Efficiency advocates say the rules help to meet load growth and reduce Americans exposure to pollutants.

“These rollbacks would just increase bills for families and businesses and add extra strain on the electric grid,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “The only folks who might benefit are companies making and selling super-inefficient products overseas who could send them here.”

Furchtgott-Roth and other conservatives say the efficiency rules deprive Americans of market choice.

“We’ve moved from an energy scarcity era in the Biden administration to an energy abundance era in the Trump administration,” she said. “There’s no need for the government to set rules for efficiency.”

Efficiency advocates say the federal rollbacks put the onus on the states. But states like Arizona are also nixing efficiency funding.

A new report from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said the efficiency rules are “raising prices, limiting product choice, and undermining performance, reliability, and longevity.”

More fossil fuels and nuclear

Supporters of Wright and Trump also say the embrace of fossil fuels increases U.S. energy security and stature globally as an energy exporter.

“By taking the steps President Trump is, he’s detaching us from China. He’s making us independent,” said Furchtgott-Roth. “If we were to have gone the Biden route, we would have been dependent on these renewables and batteries.”

While environmentalists are critical of the administration’s dismantling of climate policy, some note that DOE is not going full steam ahead on liquefied natural gas exports.

“The Department of Energy has actually been proceeding much more cautiously because I think industry advised them that they need to,” said Slocum. “If you approve an LNG application in a hasty or sloppy manner, it could be undone by courts and things could get tied up for a long time.”

Slocum said a recent approval of the CP2 LNG export project “was very careful and really went through the protesters’ arguments in pretty significant detail.”

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has pushed aggressively for more LNG commitments in U.S. trade deals. But the trade deals announced this year are not the traditional pacts approved by Congress with the force of law.

“The trade and tariff associated LNG push that Secretary Wright has been intimately involved in … when you start to put a microscope on it, it’s a big nothing burger so far,” said Slocum.

Even still, the proposed Alaska LNG project — despite the Trump administration’s zealous support for it — has yet to reach a final investment decision on the project’s 807-mile natural gas pipeline. Trump officials have touted several nonbinding agreements for the project.

On the homefront, Wright has used emergency authorities to force utilities to operate fossil fuel plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington. And new policies to boost fossil fuels keep rolling in. In early December, for instance, Wright teased new rules to use fossil-fuel-based backup generators to meet demand growth.

Meanwhile, nuclear energy is a major priority for the administration. The White House has pledged to quadruple nuclear energy in the United States by 2050 and is pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite license approvals.

DOE is poised to fund new uranium enrichment projects in the U.S., with a deadline approaching on a cutoff for Russian imports that are vital to the U.S. nuclear sector. But so far, utilities are moving sluggishly — if at all — to contract to build new nuclear plants.

AI, renewables and clean tech

A central question lingering over DOE in the coming months is what will happen to emerging technologies that could either advance or stall depending on federal funding. DOE has played a significant role in the past in commercializing technologies such as utility-scale solar through its loan office and other grants.

“We haven’t seen the most aggressive RFIs and requests for proposals … compared to how much funding they have available. Will there be new areas that emerge?” Kizer asked.

He said he is also watching closely how DOE taps nonmonetary tools to advance technologies, citing the department’s move in October to take a 5 percent stake in Lithium Americas.

Wright has framed much of DOE’s strategy around the push for AI, including plans to build data centers on federal land and implement the “Genesis Mission” on supercomputing.

One technology with a murky future is “clean” hydrogen, which was a focus of the Biden administration and backed by $8 billion under the infrastructure law. DOE has since moved to cancel two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast tied to producing fuel with renewables, but the fate of six other hubs — and billions of dollars from the law — remains up in the air.

What DOE decides will be particularly important for “blue” hydrogen produced with natural gas tied to carbon capture. According to analysts, that form of hydrogen is likely to be the focus in the U.S. partly because of rollbacks in federal support for renewables that would bolster “green” hydrogen.

But blue hydrogen has shown signs of struggling, underscoring the importance of the infrastructure law funding for the industry. Last month, Exxon Mobil said it was pausing plans for a major blue hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, because of weak customer demand.

Environmentalists also have been raising concerns that administration changes to DOE models could allow hydrogen companies receiving federal tax credits to release more methane emissions with projects than previously envisioned.

With other emerging technologies, like fusion, funding is also a critical issue. Wright has been pushing for fusion — which envisions power plants using the same reaction powering the sun — and the recent DOE reorganization created a new office for the industry. The move will help gear the department more toward commercialization of projects, but details are being sorted out, said Andrew Holland, CEO of the Fusion Industry Association.

The new office shows the “administration takes seriously the goal and challenges of getting fusion energy commercialized,” said Holland, who met with Dario Gil, DOE’s undersecretary for science, this month.

But “there’s a reality that we’re in a budget-constrained environment,” he said in an interview. The fusion office currently is funded at around $800 million, and the industry is pushing for funding closer to $1 billion annually.

“We’re confident if the administration asked for it, Congress would support them,” Holland said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d8/fc/65d3ee274f048e4f384ae6b95a21/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2239622469,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:36.099346

That reduction coincides with a case backlog TCEQ faces.
As of August, the agency reported a backlog of 1,480 enforcement cases.
In the past, the EPA would help investigate state claims, but as the federal agency faces its own cuts, state cannot rely as much as in year prior.
These state budget numbers that come out are not per capita of the total budget.","The Texas Commission for Environmental Quality has struggled to keep up with enforcement claims amid years of cuts to the state environmental agency's budget, according to a recent study.

When adjusted for inflation, TCEQ’s budget was cut by roughly one-third between 2010 and 2024, even as the number of regulated industrial facilities in the state increased, according to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The agency in 2010 had a budget of $539 million. The agency most recently worked on a $407 million budget in 2024.

That reduction coincides with a case backlog TCEQ faces. As of August, the agency reported a backlog of 1,480 enforcement cases.

In some cases, claims remain untouched for several years, said Kathryn Guerra, a former TCEQ employee who now works as an agency watchdog with the nonprofit group Public Citizen.

“Historically, the agency's own enforcement policy was to hold enforcement cases for several years,” said Guerra, who also worked with EIP for their Texas analysis. “And that unfortunately created for the TCEQ a really extensive backlog of pretty complex cases. In one instance, very recently, we saw an enforcement case go before the commissioners for approval, that was 10 years of enforcement action.”

According to the TCEQ, of the 9,198 complaints filed in 2025, just 6% of claims were investigated within five days. Nearly 55% of claims took a month or more to address.

That could leave some communities without recourse, said Andrew Quicksall with SMU’s environmental health and compliance quality program.

“It's like any other sort of enforcement or investigation that you may do,” Quicksall said. “Eventually things get backlogged to a point where you can't address them. And we have those problems where we have environmental claims that go without investigation because the backlog is so large.”

Quicksall also said cuts at the federal level have also strained the TCEQ's enforcement bandwidth. In the past, the EPA would help investigate state claims, but as the federal agency faces its own cuts, state cannot rely as much as in year prior.

The EIP's report also found that during the last legislative session, TCEQ requested nearly $60 million in additional funding and over 150 new staff positions to address its growing workload.

Following the 2025 Legislative Session, lawmakers only approved part of TCEQ’s $60 million and increased staffing request only granting the agency 67 new positions and a $47 million budget.

That limited funding can shape how vigorously the agency pursues enforcement, Guerra said.

“TCEQ has discretion to implement its own enforcement policies, and we're seeing those policies be very lenient towards industry,” he said. “The agency can be its own worst enemy with those enforcement policies because they've created a really complex backlog of cases by just holding them. Ultimately, what that means is that the communities that are suffering from environmental harm are not seeing any relief.”

TCEQ declined to provide a comment for this story, but the agency did send its annual enforcement policy report. In that report the agency says nearly a third of complaints are never investigated by the TCEQ but are either referred to another agency or are closed because of insufficient information.

The agency does acknowledge in its report that it has steered away investigators from enforcing new complaints because they were assigned to reducing its backlog.

Texas has seen a boom in industry and population in recent years. Advocates warn that if those trends continue, the reduced TCEQ budget may not be able to keep up with new enforcement claims in both existing and new sectors like data centers coming into the state.

In North Texas, Google already has two data centers in Red Oak and Midlothian with plans to build two more centers in the coming years. Google alone plans to invest $40 billion in Texas over the next two years. Other companies have also made plans in recent months, with millions of dollars coming to the state.

While state leaders have been eager to bring in these facilities, the massive centers use a significant amount of energy and water.

TCEQ, in a letter to the state legislature, warned increases in permits and new technologies like AI data centers could strain the agency’s operation.

""Without additional resources, it will be difficult for TCEQ to meet the increasing demands placed on the agency, including emerging technologies, and maintain state primacy for many of its programs.” the agency told lawmakers ahead of this year's session.

Guerra worries growing industry could strain the already stretched investigators.

""I'm very concerned about the TCEQ's capacity to regulate the industries it presently regulates and with this really booming expansion of AI and data centers that, by nature, take up significant resources and thereby need regulating,"" said Guerra.

Despite seeing a marginal increase in the past few years, the TCEQ is not positioned to handle growing demand, according to SMU's Quicksall.

“Our population is exploding,” Quicksall said. “And that's kind of a hidden issue here. We should be increasing [the budget] because of our increasing population. These state budget numbers that come out are not per capita of the total budget. But of course, our emissions, our environmental needs, roughly, are per capita. And so while you see the last three and now four years as increases, in reality, we've only just now gotten back to where we were 15 years ago.”

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory.
Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.
Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers.","Calls are mounting for the largest US grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in 2027, according PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans. The fee is a charge to ensure access to supplies, but doesn’t include the costs of power used.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive build-out of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators, Vistra Corp., which rose 1.9% in late trading Wednesday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.1%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesman Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities – Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. – will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans.","On Tuesday, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, announced that a major climate research center will be “broken up.” The National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, is a significant contributor to research on the weather, climate, and other atmospheric phenomena. The move will be a crippling blow to climate research in the US and is being widely decried by scientists.

Vought initially gave a statement regarding NCAR to USA Today and later confirmed the outlet’s reporting on social media. Calling it “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought also decried what he termed “woke” activities at NCAR. These appear to be fairly typical efforts made to attract underrepresented groups to the sciences—efforts that were uncontroversial prior to the current administration.

NCAR is primarily based in a complex on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado, and maintains a supercomputing center in Wyoming. Much of its funding comes from the National Science Foundation, but the day-to-day management is handled by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a nonprofit that represents 130 individual educational institutions. In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans. NCAR hosts a series of webpages that explain its research and all the ways it helps society.

Vought indicates that the government will specifically target what were termed “green new scam research activities,” while moving other aspects of the center’s work to different institutions. The government doesn’t directly manage activities at NCAR, though, and it’s not clear whether its agreement with UCAR allows it to directly order these sorts of changes. The NSF has since released a statement that suggests it’s ready to do as ordered; it references preserving a list of critical functions that does not include climate change, and discusses divesting NCAR resources like its supercomputing center and research aircraft.

UCAR, for its part, has issued a statement indicating that the USA Today article was the first it has heard of the matter.

In many cases where the administration has attempted to take drastic actions like this, courts have ruled that they run afoul of a legal prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” federal actions. That said, courtroom losses haven’t inhibited the administration’s willingness to try, and the time spent waiting for legal certainty can often accomplish many of its aims, such as disrupting research on politically disfavored subjects and forcing scientists to look elsewhere for career stability.

Scientists, meanwhile, are reacting with dismay. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” said Texas Tech climate researcher Katharine Hayhoe. “Everyone who works in climate and weather has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.”

Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, called NCAR a “unique and valuable asset” and emphasized the wide range of research conducted there.

Obviously, shutting down one source of information about climate change won’t alter what’s happening—greenhouse gases will continue to behave as physics dictates, raising global temperatures. But the Trump administration seemingly views everything through the lens of ideology. It has concluded that scientists are its ideological opponents and thus that its own ideologically driven conclusions are equal to the facts produced by science. Because of that perspective, it has been willing to harm scientists, even if the cost will eventually be felt by the public that Trump ostensibly represents.

Carol Howle, current Executive Vice-President, Supply, Trading & Shipping, will serve as interim CEO until April. Auchincloss will serve in an advisory role until December 2026.

O’Neill, currently CEO of Woodside Energy, oversaw the acquisition of BHP Petroleum International. Before joining Woodside Energy in 2018, she spent 23 years at ExxonMobil in technical, operational and leadership positions.

Albert Manifold, Chair of BP, said her “relentless focus” on business improvement will prepare the multinational firm for its next growth phase.

“The board believes this transition creates an opportunity to accelerate our strategic vision to become a simpler, leaner, and more profitable company,” he said.

Auchincloss said after more than three decades with BP, now is the right time to hand the reins to a new leader, and despite the announcement taking the markets by surprise, insisted it has been in his plans.

“When Albert became Chair (in July), I expressed my openness to step down were an appropriate leader identified who could accelerate delivery of bp’s strategy,” he said.

Auchincloss, who took over as CEO from Bernard Looney last year, was responsible for a fundamental reset of BP’s strategy, scaling back some ambitious low-carbon energy investments and increasing focus on oil and gas production to boost returns and compete with rivals.

Despite the strategic changes, BP’s share price performance lagged its rivals, and the stock was 16% lower at the end of his first year as permanent CEO than at the start. This underperformance led to criticism and pressure from activist investors such as Elliott.

BP recently pulled out from the H2Teesside blue hydrogen project in a fresh set back to the UK’s hydrogen industry and government’s net zero push.

BP exited the Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in Pilbara, Australia, in July, as it pivoted to fossil fuels.

At the end of April, BP announced it will supply natural gas to Woodside for its Louisiana LNG project, marking Woodside’s first secured tranche of feed gas for the site.

Alongside the merger with BHP Petroleum, Woodside Energy said O’Neill led the company to final investment decision (FID) on the Scarborough Energy Project, startup of the Sangomar Project, FID for the Louisiana LNG Project, and the Beaumont New Ammonia acquisition, among others.

Emboldened by the 2024 election results that resulted in full GOP control of Washington, Republicans began the year on a political high, but it’s been rough going since then. President Donald Trump’s job ratings have slipped back into mediocrity, and Democrats have consistently overperformed in elections around the country.

It’s possible that voter sentiment will improve from a rebounding economy, helping Republicans narrowly salvage their majorities in Congress. But what’s more likely is the political environment gets worse for the GOP, allowing Democrats to experience sizable midterm gains.

While it’s wise to be open-minded about a wide range of outcomes, particularly more than 10 months from an election, there are two most likely scenarios for 2026.

A GOP squeaker

Republicans are aware of the historical midterm trends: In recent weeks, both Speaker Mike Johnson and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson have mentioned defying them. The president’s party has lost House seats in 20 of the past 22 midterm elections, and the fewest number of seats lost in those cycles were four (1962) and five (1986). House Republicans can’t afford to lose more than two next year.

But the conditions during the two midterm outliers, 2002 and 1998, don’t match the current environment.

In 2002, Republicans gained eight House seats, bolstered by President George W. Bush’s 68 percent job approval rating during the first midterm. And Democrats gained five House seats in 1998, when President Bill Clinton’s job approval was at 66 percent. Trump’s job approval rating is 43 percent, according to Nate Silver’s national average.

Even if Trump were to abandon his tariffs and the economy bounces back, his job approval is unlikely to get much higher. That’s just not what happens to presidents of either party at a similar point. Typically, presidents become less popular as midterms approach. More specifically, the average drop is 8 points off their job approval rating.

The most encouraging midterm scenario for Republicans might also be the most recent. President Joe Biden’s job approval rating was 40 percent for the 2022 elections, according to Gallup, and yet Democrats lost a modest nine House seats and even gained a Senate seat. The Republican gains were, of course, enough for the House majority, but the cycle could have been much worse for Democrats given Biden’s political condition. This cycle, a nine-seat loss might be enough for Republicans to hold on to the House if the outstanding redistricting efforts break in their party’s favor. And anything less than a four-seat Democratic gain in the Senate would preserve GOP control of that chamber.

But, on the current trajectory, the midterms are likely to get more difficult for Republicans.

A GOP wipeout

It’s clear that GOP strategists believe the current political environment is poor when a common refrain heard is “There’s still time.” Not only should that be added to the list of “Things Losing Candidates Say,” but there’s little evidence that time will help Republicans since the current trend line is working against them.

Trump’s job approval rating has been on a steady decline from 52 percent at the beginning of his term to 43 percent now, according to Nate Silver. That tracks closely with his previous White House stint, when his approval rating was at 38 percent during the 2018 midterms, according to Gallup, and Democrats had a net gain of 41 seats. Over those four years in office, his popularity didn’t improve demonstrably.

Democrats currently have a narrow advantage on the generic ballot, 44 percent to 41 percent, according to the Decision Desk HQ average. And, maybe more importantly, they’ve been consistently overperforming their 2024 margins in a variety of real races and places, from coast to coast, over the past year. Their candidates overperformed in Democratic areas (Virginia, New Jersey, California), Republican areas (Tennessee’s 7th District, Florida’s 1st and 6th) and swing areas (Georgia).

Republicans can try to explain away individual contests, but the trend is clear. And even the Republican wins in 2025 should be concerning for the party because of the reduced margins, sometimes even with good turnout.

A similar overperformance in November would deliver the House to Democrats with plenty of seats to spare and put the Senate within reach. Republicans should win GOP-leaning states such as Ohio, Iowa, Texas and Alaska under normal political conditions. But if 2026 is extraordinary for Democrats, the elections could feel closer to 2018, 2010 or 2006 than to 2022.

More than the president literally putting his name on midterm ballots as he suggested this week, Republicans need Trump’s political standing to improve. They need voters to feel better about the economy, cost of living and direction of the country with Republicans in power. Time is running out on their ability to blame Barack Obama for the high cost of health care and Biden for the economy, particularly when both are so far out of the public eye.

There are plenty of other potential pitfalls for the GOP, including the rising costs of health care (especially if the Affordable Care Act subsidies expire and there’s no alternative), Trump’s immigration tactics and retribution tour, the Epstein files, the president’s age, a war with Venezuela that no one knew was necessary and a White House ballroom no one knew was needed. Even good economic news would have a tough time cutting through all the other noise.

The bottom line is that the Republican Party doesn’t do well in elections in which President Donald Trump is the focus. And by nature of his personality and being the incumbent president, the GOP is on track for that scenario to repeat itself. When recent outcomes match up with historical trends, it’s up to the other party to demonstrate how this cycle is going to be an aberration.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/house_gop_458_121625.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:39.995995

Randy Weber, R-TX, has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act of 2025, a bill aimed at establishing voluntary federal standards for environmental claims on packaging.

The legislation seeks to eliminate misleading labels that confuse consumers about recycling and composting, while promoting transparency and consistency across the industry.

Across the United States, a patchwork of state regulations has allowed unverified claims such as ""recyclable,"" ""compostable,"" and ""reusable"" to appear on packaging, often without any connection to real-world recycling or composting systems. This inconsistency has made it harder for consumers to determine what can actually be recycled and has undermined legitimate environmental initiatives.

""Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,"" Weber said in a statement. ""The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It's pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.""

Issues & challenges

Packaging and labeling standards in the United States are increasingly shaped by state-level regulations, particularly those adopted in California. Due to the size of California's market, the state's standards often have national implications for manufacturers, supply chains, and consumers, even when companies operate primarily outside of California. This dynamic has raised concerns about regulatory consistency and the impact of state-specific requirements on interstate commerce.

The PACK Act would require environmental claims on packaging to be scientifically verified and recognized by existing recycling programs. By ensuring claims are backed by credible evidence, the bill aims to build consumer trust in environmentally friendly packaging without imposing additional mandates on companies. Industry leaders have expressed strong support for the initiative, emphasizing its potential to create a clear, national framework for packaging regulations.

Currently, packaging regulations vary significantly across states, creating confusion for consumers and challenges for businesses navigating inconsistent requirements. Industry representatives have commended the PACK Act for addressing these regulatory inconsistencies. They believe the bill will help streamline compliance, reduce consumer confusion, and support the adoption of sustainable packaging practices.

If passed, the PACK Act could mark a significant step forward in aligning environmental claims with scientific standards, fostering greater transparency, and enhancing consumer confidence in recycling and composting efforts.

Groups offer support

Lynn Dyer, president of Ameripen, praised Weber for introducing the PACK Act and expressed the organization's support for the bill's creation of a federal framework for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

""This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging,"" Dyer said. ""Ameripen will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.""

The Plastics Industry Association also voiced its support for Weber and the PACK Act.

""The Plastics Industry Association thanks Congressman Weber for introducing the PACK Act,"" said Matt Seaholm, PLASTICS President and CEO. ""Plastic packaging is essential to modern life — protecting products, keeping food fresh, and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely — yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims. This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.""

Seaholm emphasized that the PACK Act would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines.

""As an industry that employs more than one million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber's leadership on this important issue that strengthens US manufacturing and consumer confidence,"" Seaholm concluded.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt08823f5db61ded5d/blt1b0889e6d697ef2f/694313a2fad0bfe41e34fe4f/CapitolHill.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:52.147840

For years, there was no comparison between Tesla and any American EV start-up, but the company's current struggles have led some investors to consider alternative plays. While the electric vehicle industry has a long road ahead, I think investing in Rivian could be a better choice right now. Here's why.

Tesla is losing steam

Tesla is by no means finished in the EV market, but the benefits that came from its early lead in electric vehicles are certainly starting to fade.

For one, Tesla faces immense competitive pressure, both from Chinese automakers abroad and at home. The company continues to lose market share around the world and, in the U.S., Tesla's vehicle sales reached a nearly four-year low in November.

Moreover, Tesla's financial picture is no longer as strong as it once was. The company's revenue rose just 12% in the third quarter to $28.1 billion, largely due to some customers rushing to purchase a Tesla before the EV tax credits expired. Even with the temporary bump, Tesla's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income fell 37% from the year-ago quarter to $1.4 billion.

That decline came as Tesla's operating expenses rose 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase for such an established company. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has set his sights on autonomy and robotics as the future of the company, and that's starting to fuel more spending.

I don't think it's misguided for Tesla to incorporate these goals into its future plans. After all, automated vehicles (AVs) could be worth an estimated $1.4 trillion by 2040, and humanoid robots may be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050. But they're also unproven markets that will take billions of dollars to develop over the coming years.

Add all of this up, and Tesla is spending more at the same time its lead in EVs is tumbling -- a bad combination.

Rivian has big ambitions, but success isn't guaranteed

Investors looking for a sure bet won't find it in Rivian, I'm sorry to say. The company, like Tesla, faces rising competition, and unlike Tesla, it isn't profitable. Rivian reported a net loss of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, with operating expenses increasing nearly 30% to $1 billion.

But one thing I think Rivian has going for is that it appears to have a solid plan for attracting customers with smaller budgets. The company's smaller R2 SUV will go on sale next year, starting at just $45,000. And in 2027, it plans to launch an even cheaper R3, priced around $40,000.

If Rivian can hold to this price tag, the R2 will be $5,000 cheaper than the average new car price -- traditional combustion engine vehicles included -- and the R3 will be $10,000 cheaper. The one nagging reason why car buyers avoid EVs is because of their cost, so if Rivian can continue to lower its prices it could potentially attract more customers.

Moreover, producing the R2 and R3 will help the company lower expenses by spreading manufacturing and production costs across more vehicles in its model lineup, and potentially increase sales by widening its customer base.

“Each iteration of the state energy plan has focused on addressing immediate needs and proactively addressing challenges on the horizon.
This is why this State energy plan is so important.","With an eye on 2040, the State Energy Planning Board voted unanimously to approve a State Energy Plan, which is based on findings from more than a year-long assessment of current systems and future energy needs that will guide the energy-related decision making.

Its objectives include ensuring affordable, abundant, reliable, and clean energy while supporting economic development, equity, and a healthy environment. The plan also embraces a continued commitment to renewables while also noting that a variety of energy sources, like advanced nuclear and natural gas, will be needed to help New York meet its overall energy needs over the next 15 years.

“The State Energy Plan is the product of a pragmatic and objective process that comes at a critical yet challenging time for energy planning in New York as we continue to build out renewable resources while factoring in new energy demands and confronting federal headwinds,” said Doreen M. Harris, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and chief executive officer. “I commend my fellow Board members and state agency staff for their dedication to developing this Plan, which identifies specific actions to advance over the next several years while maintaining resource diversity – which is key to continued energy reliability and affordability for all New Yorkers.”

The plan was developed at a time when the energy sector faces significant uncertainty stemming from economic pressures and a shift in federal priorities and policies away from renewable energy projects. The analyses conducted for the Plan have been updated to reflect the latest available data and federal actions since modelling was completed for the Draft Plan released in July. Updates also included further focus on energy affordability considerations and strategies to manage system costs, including through demand-side flexibility and added discussion of new, large loads and ways to manage associated grid and cost impacts.

The analyses inform five primary planning goals and associated actions to continue to meet New York’s energy needs which include:

— Delivering abundant, reliable, resilient and clean energy through a diverse mix of resources and supply infrastructure, while supporting energy efficiency and load flexibility.

— Providing affordable energy to households and equitable benefits – with a focus on reducing the upfront costs of efficiency and clean energy choices to help cut spending and lessen the burden for lower-income households.

— Supporting economic growth and competitiveness by investing in workforce development, meeting the needs of large energy users, and attracting new industry, including clean energy leaders.

— Strengthening partnerships across New York’s innovation ecosystem to foster economic development, create jobs, and provide greater leverage for State investments.

— Continuing progress toward decarbonization and a clean energy economy.

One of Western New York’s largest providers showed its support for the plan. “NYSERDA and the State Energy Planning Board demonstrated strong, thoughtful leadership in their 2025 State Energy Plan, expanding on Governor Hochul’s call for an all-of-the above approach,” said National Grid New York President Sally Librera in a statement. “Importantly, the plan recognizes critical electric and natural gas infrastructure investments are needed to meet the growing demands of our customers, including businesses that power our economy. National Grid stands ready to support the next phase of policy making that will ensure New York’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future.”

The process to update the State Energy Plan was announced in August 2024. The State Energy Planning Board, comprised of the heads of 10 state agencies and authorities, appointees from the governor, Senate, and Assembly, and the president of the New York Independent System Operator, commenced its work to assess and compile data to inform the Draft State Energy Plan, which was released in July for public review and comment.

The release of the Plan follows a public comment period which included 10 public hearings, seven in-person and three virtual, and written comments. The State Energy Planning Board received and considered nearly 15,000 written comments and more than 1,000 people attended public hearings, with nearly 450 providing oral comments – which were also considered. The Board received input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including individual New Yorkers, environmental organizations, utilities and energy companies, labor unions, and trade and business organizations, underscoring the importance of the Plan’s focus on energy affordability and maintaining an abundant and diverse mix of energy sources and supply infrastructure.

“Energy planning is far from a simple endeavor,” said New York State Public Service Commission Chair Rory M. Christian said. “Each iteration of the state energy plan has focused on addressing immediate needs and proactively addressing challenges on the horizon. Today, we have many challenges. Rapid load growth, increasingly frequent severe weather driven by climate change and a constantly evolving federal landscape that is absent of the stability needed to ensure energy security.

EVXL’s Take I’ve watched solid-state battery promises for nearly a decade now, and I’ve developed a simple rule: take any announced timeline and add five years.","I’ve been tracking solid-state battery announcements for years now, and the gap between what manufacturers promise and what they actually deliver keeps getting wider. Top Gear’s latest deep-dive on next-generation EV tech finally puts some honest timelines on the table, and they’re not what most prospective buyers want to hear.

Here’s what you need to know:

What: Rimac Technology revealed its solid-state battery prototype at the Munich IAA show, developed with ProLogium and Mitsubishi

When: Test car by 2028, production car (likely a Bugatti) around 2030, price parity with conventional batteries by 2035

The specs: 25% more energy density, 10-80% charging in 6-10 minutes, non-flammable, retains 95% capacity at -4°F (-20°C)

Why it matters: If you’re waiting for solid-state batteries to hit mainstream EVs, you’re looking at a decade-long wait

The Timeline Problem Nobody Wants to Discuss

Rimac COO Nurdin Pitarević was unusually candid in his assessment. “It’ll take until 2028 before there’s a battery in a test car, and around 2030 before it’s in a production car,” he told Top Gear’s Paul Horrell. And that production car? Almost certainly a multi-million dollar Bugatti, not something you or I will be cross-shopping against a Model Y.

The 2035 price parity target is the number that should grab your attention. That’s when Pitarević expects solid-state batteries to cost the same as today’s NMC lithium-ion packs. For context, that’s the same year the EU plans to ban new combustion engine sales.

This tracks with what we’ve seen from every major SSB announcement. Toyota has been promising solid-state batteries since 2020, pushing the target from 2023 to 2026 to now 2027-2028. QuantumScape, backed by Volkswagen, just demonstrated their technology in a Ducati motorcycle at IAA Munich, but actual cars remain years away.

The Semi-Solid Reality Check: Nio Already Tried This

Here’s something the solid-state hype machine doesn’t want you to know: Nio already shipped semi-solid batteries, and they discontinued them.

The Chinese automaker’s 150 kWh semi-solid battery pack, developed with WeLion, promised 650+ miles of range and hit the market in late 2023. It worked. CEO William Li personally live-streamed a 14-hour, 1,044 km (650 mile) drive to prove it.

Then they stopped making it.

“We deployed the battery packs providing our users the option to flexibly upgrade to the 150kWh [and] found that actually they are not using this pack as often as we expected,” Li explained to EV media in November 2025. Translation: when you have good charging infrastructure (Nio operates 2,300+ battery swap stations in China), nobody wants to pay premium prices for extreme range.

The 150 kWh pack’s subscription fee was prohibitive, and only a few hundred units were ever produced. It wasn’t a technology failure, it was a market failure. Customers voted with their wallets, and they chose convenience over capacity.

The Players: Who’s Actually Close to Production?

The solid-state landscape breaks down into three tiers:

Tier 1: Actually demonstrated in vehicles

QuantumScape and VW’s PowerCo debuted their QSE-5 cells in a modified Ducati V21L motorcycle at IAA Munich. The specs are impressive: 844 Wh/L energy density and 12.2 minutes from 10-80% charge. But a motorcycle and a mass-market car are very different animals. PowerCo has a license to produce up to 40 GWh per year when the technology matures, enough for roughly one million vehicles.

Tier 2: Validated cells, no vehicles yet

Factorial Energy has validated 77Ah cells with Stellantis and Mercedes, claiming 375 Wh/kg energy density and 18-minute charging from 15-90%. Mercedes drove a modified EQS 750 miles on a single charge using Factorial’s quasi-solid-state batteries. A demonstration fleet is planned for 2026, but Factorial’s true solid-state “Solstice” technology isn’t expected until the end of the decade.

Tier 3: Big promises, long timelines

Chery claims 600 Wh/kg energy density and 808 miles of range, targeting pilot production in 2026 and mass production in 2027. Toyota continues to promise 621+ miles of range and 40-year battery lifespans, but has yet to put solid-state cells in a production vehicle despite a decade of announcements.

Range Extenders: The Technology That Actually Works Today

While the industry chases solid-state dreams, a simpler solution is quietly taking over.

Range extenders (REX) use a small gasoline engine purely as a generator to charge the battery, never directly powering the wheels. The technology had its moment a decade ago with the BMW i3 REX and Chevrolet Volt, then largely disappeared from Western markets.

Now it’s back, and Chinese automakers are leading the charge. Li Auto built its entire business on extended-range EVs, running on batteries 95% of the time with a small engine for backup. BYD’s DM-i models, Yangwang’s U8, and Mazda’s MX-30 all use the technology.

The Western response is coming. BMW plans to launch the iX5 Rex by 2026 with a targeted 621-mile total range. The company is also considering range extenders for the X5 and 7-Series in China, where its sales have collapsed 30% as local manufacturers dominate with exactly this technology.

Supplier ZF has developed a plug-and-play range extender solution that could be used to retrofit existing battery electric cars, expected from next year. VW’s Scout brand will offer range-extended SUVs in the US, and Ram is preparing a range-extended 1500 REV pickup targeting 690 miles of total range.

Why Range Extenders Make Sense Right Now

The math favors range extenders in the near term:

Smaller battery, lower cost: A REX vehicle can use a 30-40 kWh battery instead of 80-100 kWh, dramatically reducing the most expensive component.

No range anxiety: When the battery depletes, the engine kicks in as a generator. You can refuel anywhere, not just at charging stations.

Peak efficiency: Unlike a traditional hybrid where the engine powers the wheels at varying RPMs, a REX engine runs only at its optimal efficiency point. This makes the “depleted battery” phase more efficient than a standard hybrid.

Electric driving experience: Because the engine never directly powers the wheels, you still get the smooth, quiet electric driving experience 95%+ of the time.

The downside? When you’re flat out on an autobahn or towing uphill after the battery is depleted, you’re limited to whatever power that small engine can generate. For most driving scenarios, this is never an issue.

EVXL’s Take

I’ve watched solid-state battery promises for nearly a decade now, and I’ve developed a simple rule: take any announced timeline and add five years. Toyota promised production SSBs by 2020. It’s 2025, and they’re now targeting 2027-2028. Rimac is refreshingly honest about 2030 being realistic for hypercars, with mainstream affordability pushed to 2035.

Here’s what I expect: Range extenders will become the dominant “bridge technology” for the next 5-7 years, especially in markets with limited charging infrastructure. We’ll see semi-solid batteries (like Factorial’s FEST technology) hit premium vehicles by 2026-2027. True solid-state won’t reach mainstream affordable EVs until the early 2030s.

For prospective buyers, the practical advice is straightforward: If you’re buying an EV in 2025-2026, don’t wait for solid-state. If range anxiety is your primary concern and you’re considering a pure BEV, take a serious look at extended-range options from Chinese manufacturers or wait for BMW’s iX5 Rex in 2026.

The Nio 150 kWh experiment proved something important: extreme range isn’t what most EV owners actually want when they have convenient charging. What they want is the confidence that they won’t be stranded. Range extenders deliver that confidence today, without waiting for battery chemistry breakthroughs that remain years away.

On December 11, JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on DTE Energy to $145 from $151 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. This sentiment was posted as the firm broadly updated models in its North American utilities group.

Earlier in its Q3 2025 earnings report, the company disclosed total operating earnings of $468 million, translating to an EPS of $2.25, which beat Street estimates by $0.14. The company’s total revenue totaled $3.53 billion in Q3, which was a 21.37% year-over-year increase and beat estimates by $295.19 million.

DTE Electric was the standout performer, achieving $541 million in operating earnings, a substantial $104 million increase compared to Q3 2024. However, the DTE Gas segment reported an unfavorable operating earnings result of $38 million, which was $25 million lower than Q3 2024, mainly due to higher O&M and rate-based costs. Separately, DTE Vantage delivered $41 million in operating earnings, an $8 million increase from 2024, while Energy Trading contributed $23 million for the quarter.

The company also announced a major increase to its capital plan and strategic initiatives driven by significant deals in the data center market. DTE finalized an agreement with a leading hyperscaler to support 1.4 gigawatts of data center load, a key milestone in its growth strategy.

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.

The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect … Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”

That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.

Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting … intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, are sponsoring a three-bill package to overturn the sales and use tax exemptions that lawmakers narrowly approved last session in hopes of enticing tech companies to build massive “hyperscale” data centers in Michigan.

Since then, no fewer than 14 hyperscale proposals have cropped up from west Michigan to metro Detroit, prompting cheers from business leaders and outcry from residents who worry the massive, energy-hungry facilities will despoil communities and strain the power grid.

“I’d like to think that some people are having second thoughts” about their vote to approve the tax breaks, said DeSana.

Still, he predicted the repeal effort would face an uphill battle in the Legislature, given the massive lobbying power of monopoly utilities that stand to ink profitable energy contracts with data center developers.

But DeSana noted that mounting public opposition to the facilities could change political dynamics. Thousands of people have filed public comments opposing Michigan’s first major hyperscale data center proposal in Washtenaw County’s Saline Township, and dozens turned out on the Capitol lawn Tuesday to call for a statewide moratorium on data center development.

Protestors chanted “no secret deals” in objection to DTE Energy’s quest to gain state approval of a 19-year power contract for the Saline Township development without publicly disclosing full terms of the contract.

A DTE spokesperson said that company still was reviewing the proposed tax break elimination and couldn’t comment.

Consumers Energy spokesperson Katie Carey said the utility is “committed to providing reliable, affordable energy that makes growth possible – helping our communities thrive today and for generations to come. Repealing this policy will put Michigan further behind other states and hinder our ability to support Michigan’s economy and long-term growth.”

On farmland in the community south of Ann Arbor, tech giants OpenAI, Oracle and Related Digital plan to build a $7 billion, 1.4-gigawatt Stargate facility that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has hailed as “the largest economic project in Michigan history.”

Other developers far along in the planning process for proposed data centers include Microsoft, which last year purchased two separate plots of industrially zoned land in Kent and Allegan counties, and a Google-connected developer that has received approval to build a six-building facility in Oakland County’s Lyon Township.

The state’s largest utilities, DTE and Consumers Energy, have told investors that, in addition to the Saline Township proposal, they are in late-stage talks with data center developers looking to secure a total of 5 gigawatts of power capacity. That amounts to between four and six average-sized hyperscale facilities. If all come to fruition, Michigan’s peak energy demand could surge 39%.

But for seemingly every newly announced proposal recently, a proposed project has been cancelled or postponed as local communities fight the massive developments.

Opponents fear lost farmland and destroyed habitat, noise pollution from thousands of humming servers, strain on the electric grid and higher bills as utilities spend mightily on infrastructure to power the facilities, and strain on rivers and aquifers amid data centers’ use of water to cool servers.

“Our resources are at risk,” said Kathryn Haushalter, who lives next to the property slated for the Stargate facility. Rather than selling too, she promised to “stay and fight” the development.

In Howell Township, public outcry and a newly passed moratorium on data centers prompted developers to withdraw a proposal to rezone farmland for a $1 billion facility. Project backers said in a Facebook post they wanted to “give the Township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers.”

Proposals in Kalkaska and in Monroe County’s Dundee Township were similarly shelved amid public pushback.

The churn of announcements and cancellations also points to the speculative nature of the data center business. Developers often pitch their plans in multiple communities, but only move forward in the community that presents the quickest pathway to approval, said Douglas Jester, managing partner at the energy consulting firm 5 Lakes Energy.

“It’s very clear that data centers are shopping for locations,” Jester said Tuesday during a forum hosted by the Michigan State University Institute for Public Policy & Social Research.

As opposition to the facilities mounts, several local governments have placed preemptive moratoriums on data center development, aiming to give local leaders time to craft regulations dictating where and how the industry can set up shop.

Beyond tax breaks, Michigan’s climate, abundant water and excess capacity on its utility grid make the state appealing to data center developers, said Dong Zhao, a Michigan State University associate professor of construction management and civil engineering who spoke during Tuesday’s forum.

“We have energy and we have water and we have the cold weather,” which can help dissipate the heat generated by running thousands of computers 24/7, he said.

Data center advocates argue the industry can bring needed benefits to Michigan, such as new revenue to help cover the costs of poles, wires and pipes that deliver electricity and water. Many communities are struggling to maintain their utility infrastructure after decades of industrial decline left systems overbuilt and underfunded.

Officials in the Benton Harbor area, for instance, have said they hope to lure a data center to bolster the customer base of a water system that struggles to cover basic maintenance after the closure of large factories that once helped pay the bills.

Officials in Augusta Township, likewise, say they have plenty of water to supply a proposed data center because the water system was built to provide millions of gallons a day to a since-closed General Motors plant.

If contracts are structured appropriately, data center developments can bring similar benefits to electricity customers, said Lucas Fykes, energy policy director for the Data Center Coalition, an industry lobbying group.

“As you add on large-load customers, you’re able to spread out those fixed costs,” Fykes said. “It puts downward pressure on rates for all the other residential customers.”

The Saline Township proposal

Utility regulators on the Michigan Public Service Commission could decide within days whether to approve power contracts for the Saline Township data center.

DTE Energy is seeking ex parte approval of a 19-year deal to supply power to the facility.

Utility officials contend that the data center will pay for more than its fair share of utility costs, resulting in $300 million in annual savings for other customers. They have urged commissioners to swiftly approve the contracts, warning that their agreement with project developers includes the option for the developers to terminate the project if power isn’t secured by Dec. 19.

The commission’s next meeting is Thursday, Dec. 18.

“Our discussions with the developer and customer have indicated they need to start construction at the beginning of the year to move forward with the project site,” DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot told Bridge Michigan last month.

Ratepayer advocacy groups, environmentalists and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel have urged commissioners to instead open up a so-called contested case, a lengthy review process that would allow deeper public scrutiny of the proposed deal. They contend the publicly available version of DTE’s application is so heavily redacted, it’s impossible to know whether it’s a good deal for ratepayers.

Holding up an oversized version of the blacked-out document during Tuesday’s protest, Nessel asked the crowd, “Does that seem transparent to you?

“We’re not asking the Public Service Commission just to completely destroy this project,” Nessel said. “We just want to know … what the hell is going on and what that will mean for the people of our state.”

In addition to the utility contract, developers need permits from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to install diesel-powered backup generators and begin construction activities that would impact wetlands and the Saline River.

Data center opponents are mobilizing to fight the wetlands request, citing “red flags,” including potential harm to endangered species, destruction of wetlands and what they say is insufficient proof that the data center’s stormwater discharge won’t pollute the Saline River.

“EGLE and EPA staff are under undue influence from state and federal administrations to approve these permits quickly, without proper due diligence, and without regard for proper regulatory compliance,” states a release from the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance of Michigan.

State environmental regulators have said there’s no firm timeline for when they will decide whether to grant the environmental permits, but the process could take several months.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iStock-160559367.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:23.941098

Pritzlaff, Acting Assistant Administrator of the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), issued an internal memorandum instituting a “Compliance First” approach, immediately effective for all civil enforcement and compliance activities. This memo claims to introduce a policy shift: prioritizing timely and effective compliance over punitive enforcement and expansive regulatory interpretations. EPA’s goal is clear, swift, and efficient compliance, achieved by the “clearest, most defensible interpretations of our statutory and regulatory mandates.”

Key Elements of the “Compliance First” Policy

Compliance Assistance Toolkit

Enforcement is not the only tool. Proactive outreach, technical assistance, voluntary audits, and self-reporting are highlighted as means to encourage regulated entities to “find and fix” issues before enforcement becomes necessary.

State and Tribal Coordination

The EPA is committed to deferential, collaborative engagement with authorized states and tribes. Civil enforcement activities will avoid duplication and promote consistency by coordinating closely with local agencies, providing them with technical support, and ensuring states lead where they have primary jurisdiction.

Transparent Communication and “No Surprises”

Open, transparent dialogue is mandated throughout inspections and enforcement. The EPA pledges a “no surprises” approach and wants regulated entities to proactively identify and address potential compliance issues, building trust, and avoiding unexpected enforcement escalation.

Clarity and Legal Precision in Findings

Findings of violation must be “clear and unambiguous” and based on the “best reading” of statutes and regulations. Expansive or creative interpretations that create uncertainty or deviate from precedent are expressly rejected, especially in light of recent Supreme Court decisions. Material legal ambiguities must be elevated to national EPA leadership for resolution, ensuring consistent application across regions.

Timely and Efficient Compliance

EPA staff are directed to focus on rapid resolution of violations, with compliance – not punishment – as the North Star. Prolonged or punitive strategies are deemphasized to avoid delaying environmental protection and economic operations. Formal enforcement and injunctive relief (such as administrative or judicial action) will be used only when informal or compliance assistance measures are insufficient or in emergencies. Remedies must be narrowly tailored, directly tied to specific violations, and based on clear legal requirements. EPA’s April 26, 2021 memorandum (Using All Appropriate Injunctive Relief Tools in Civil Enforcement Settlements), which focused on expansive injunctive measures and supplemental environmental projects (SEPs), is also rescinded, pending new guidance. OECA Assistant Administrator approval is required for non-standard remedies like third-party audits.

Reasoned, Transparent Decisions Using LEAPS

The memo introduces the LEAPS framework for enforcement decisions:

Law: Use the clearest statutory/regulatory interpretation;

Evidence: Rely on solid, unequivocal facts;

Analysis: Apply logic and connect facts with law;

Programmatic Impact: Consider effects on EPA programs; and

Stakeholder Impact: Assess how actions affect states, tribes, and regulated entities

The memo states that EPA is aiming for transparent, reasoned decisions anchored in LEAPS to make enforcement predictable and defensible.

Practical Implications for the Regulated Community

Potential for more opportunities for rapid, voluntary compliance and proactive technical assistance.

Legal disputes over novel or ambiguous regulatory interpretations should be elevated to national leadership, potentially providing regulated entities with a new escalation pathway.

Formal remedies such as SEPs and wide-ranging monitoring should be restricted, and enforcement actions should now be both more predictable and tied tightly to statutory requirements.

EPA will soon issue a single guidance document to harmonize enforcement practices agency-wide, offering more clarity and consistency for regulated parties.

Final Thoughts

While this “new” policy shares similarities with prior EPA enforcement guidance and does not create legally binding rights, the intent appears to portray a shift in EPA enforcement philosophy to prioritizing clarity, efficiency, and cooperation over adversarial posturing or creative statutory interpretations. While it is too early to know what practical implications this will have for enforcement actions, EPA’s memo is a helpful reminder for regulated entities to review their compliance programs, prepare for inspections, and document legal positions carefully to align with the “best reading” standard now embedded in EPA practice.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16139_0319.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 00:00:25.525657

About Entergy Louisiana Entergy Louisiana, LLC provides electric service to more than 1 million customers in 58 parishes.
Entergy Louisiana is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR), an integrated Entergy company engaged in electric power production, transmission and retail distribution operations.
Headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, Entergy has annual revenues of $10 billion and approximately 12,000 employees.","WEST FELICIANA PARISH, La. – Hut 8, an energy infrastructure platform integrating power, digital infrastructure and computing at scale to fuel next-generation, energy-intensive use cases, announced it will develop the River Bend artificial intelligence (AI) data center campus in Southeast Louisiana. The project represents a up to $10 billion investment in Phase I, including Hut 8’s investment in data center infrastructure.

At the peak of construction on Phase I, Hut 8 anticipates approximately 1,000 construction workers on-site. Once operational, Phase I of the River Bend campus is expected to create at least 75 direct new jobs with employment expected to expand significantly as future phases of the campus are developed. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 193 indirect new jobs, for a total of 268 potential new job opportunities in the Capital Region.

“Louisiana continues to win,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “Hut 8’s investment in River Bend builds on our track record of attracting global-scale projects in the industries of the future. As the campus grows, it will further cement Louisiana’s position as a national leader in energy and innovation, creating thousands of jobs and reaffirming our ability to compete and win on the global stage.”

Fluidstack, supported by a financial backstop from Google covering all lease and related pass-through obligations, will be a tenant at the site, which has the potential to scale to up to 1,000 MW of utility capacity, and positions Louisiana as a long-term hub for high-performance computing infrastructure.

“River Bend is a testament to the power of partnership,” Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said. “This project was made possible by the leadership of state and local leaders, the commitment of Entergy, and the determination of the people of Louisiana. Together, we will build infrastructure that supports the world’s most advanced technological applications at scale while setting a standard for how utilities, governments, and innovators can drive lasting economic and technological progress.”

Hut 8 tapped Entergy Louisiana to provide an initial 330 megawatts (MW) of utility capacity to support 245 MW of critical IT load for Fluidstack, a leading AI cloud platform for training and inference. This agreement was contemplated in Entergy’s more recent outlooks provided in November 2025.

“Energy is one of Louisiana’s greatest competitive advantages,” President and CEO of Entergy Louisiana Phillip May said. “Our ability to deliver reliable, scalable power while maintaining some of the lowest electricity rates in the country gives companies like Hut 8 the confidence to invest here, fueling economic growth and creating long-term value for our customers and communities.”

The State of Louisiana has positioned itself as a premier destination for global-scale projects like River Bend through a competitive portfolio of incentive programs. Hut 8 is expected to participate in Louisiana’s state and local sales and use tax rebate on qualifying purchases or leases of data center equipment, established in Act 730 of the 2024 Regular Legislative Session. Hut 8 also plans to participate in the state’s Quality Jobs program.

“River Bend demonstrates that Louisiana’s economic strategy is taking our state from plans to progress,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “This project will generate high-wage jobs and create pathways for Louisianans to build long-term careers in the industries of the future. It’s a clear example of how aligning policy, partnership and people translates into lasting opportunity.”

Construction on the data center is already underway with operations expected to commence by the second quarter of 2027.

“West Feliciana Parish is proud to welcome Hut 8 and River Bend to our community,” said Parish President Kenny Havard. “This is a once-in-a-generation project that will bring jobs, opportunity, and investment to our parish for decades to come. It shows what’s possible when local, state, and industry partners work together toward a shared vision of growth and progress.”

Hut 8’s River Bend campus builds on Louisiana’s momentum of landmark economic development projects over the past year that have reshaped the state’s economy and strengthening its global competitiveness. In the past year, Louisiana has secured milestone investments including Meta’s $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana and Hyundai Steel Company’s nearly $6 billion investment to establish its first North American manufacturing facility in Donaldsonville.

Over 30 people from the Seattle area and beyond, all volunteers with Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), joined a nationwide lobbying push the week of Nov. 17–21 to urge support for affordable clean energy and promote a policy that combats wildfire risk. CCL is a national, nonpartisan, grassroots nonprofit dedicated to growing the political will for a liveable world.

Americans, including households in Washington State, are increasingly experiencing rising electricity costs driven by escalating climate extremes and the rapid growth of energy-intensive data centers.

At the same time, we have seen firsthand the impacts of a changing climate – forest fires making the air unhealthy to breathe, unprecedented heat waves, impacts on seasonal rainfall and snow pack, droughts in key agricultural regions, and flooding—underscoring the need for policies to address the climate crisis.

During meetings with the offices of Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell as well as 9 out of 10 Washington Representatives, citizen lobbyists from across the state appealed for Congressional action to fast-track comprehensive, bi-partisan energy permitting reform to get more affordable clean electricity onto the grid as the cost of living skyrockets. More than 95% of the projects awaiting permits are clean energy.

According to the Clean Energy Power Association:

“Today, the average timeline for a project to obtain necessary National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews is 4.5 years. For transmission projects, the average timeline is even longer – 6.5 years.”

CCL advocated for comprehensive, bipartisan, permitting reform and pointed to the Problem Solvers Caucus’ Framework for Permitting Reform as a good start on the policies that could be in such a bill.

CCL volunteers also promoted the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA, S.1462), a bill that recently passed the Senate Agriculture Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 18-5. It would ensure U.S. forests are well-maintained and resilient in the face of increasing wildfires. Wildfire smoke contributes to the deaths of about 40,000 people a year in the U.S., according to a study by Nature. Alarmingly, that number is projected to rise to 70,000 people by 2050.

A previous version of FOFA passed the House (H.R.471) 279-141 in January. CCL believes that the Senate version is even stronger and has earned the endorsements of important environmental groups, including National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, and of course, CCL. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), one of the Senate bill’s co-sponsors said, “As increasingly frequent and catastrophic wildfires in California make clear, we need durable solutions to confront the growing impacts of the wildfire crisis.”

“Burien and every local neighborhood will benefit if Congress passes bi-partisan permitting reform and forest health laws that lead to more affordable electricity and air less polluted by wildfire smoke,” said Larry Steele, a CCL liaison to Senator Murray who lives in Des Moines and who met with her staff this week.

“These issues make sense to a lot of people, so support is growing for bi-partisan action in Congress. This is a great time for people to message our Senators and Representatives to show support for cheaper energy, clean air, and protection for the forests we love.”

“It’s exciting to exercise the skills of democracy at such a turbulent time,” Steele added. “The opportunity to talk directly with our representatives and their staff feels very empowering. I was amazed that CCL can take ordinary concerned citizens like me and train them to do something so important.”

Prior to lobby meetings, local volunteers with Citizens’ Climate Lobby attended CCL’s virtual Fall Conference on Nov. 14–15, featuring empowering speakers and training opportunities to build common ground across political divides.

“CCL’s willingness to reach across divides and build bridges is what sets us apart, and we’re needed more than ever these days,” said Ricky Bradley, CCL’s Interim Executive Director. “I’m excited about the ways we will help move the conversation forward on clean energy through federal permitting reform, and I’m proud of our ongoing commitment to do this work in a nonpartisan way.”

Everyone — politicians and the public — is talking about energy costs. In particular, they’re talking about data centers that drive artificial intelligence systems and their increasing energy demand, electricity costs and strain on the nation’s already overloaded energy grid.

As a former state energy official and utility executive, I know that many of the underlying questions involving energy affordability are very complex and have been festering for decades, in part because of how many groups are involved. Energy projects are expensive and take a long time to build. Where to build them is often also a difficult, even controversial, question. Consumers, regulators, utilities and developers all value energy reliability but have different interests, cost sensitivities and time frames in mind.

The problem of high energy prices is not new, but it is urgent. And it comes at a time when the U.S. is deeply divided on its approaches to energy policy and the politics of solving collective problems.

Rising costs

From September 2024 to September 2025, average U.S. residential electricity prices have risen 7.4%, from 16.8 to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. Government analysts expect prices will continue to rise and outpace inflation in 2026.

With household earnings basically flat when adjusted for inflation, these increases hit consumers hard. They take up higher percentages of household expenses — especially for lower-income households. Electricity prices have effects throughout the economy, both directly on consumers’ budgets and indirectly by raising operating costs for business and industry, which pass them along to customers by raising prices for goods and services.

The problem

By 2030, energy analysts expect U.S. electricity demand to rise about 25%, and McKinsey estimates that data centers’ energy use could nearly triple from current levels by that year, using as much as 11.7% of all electricity in the U.S. — more than double their current share.

The nation’s current electricity grid is not ready to supply all that energy. And even if the electricity could be generated, transmission lines are aging and not up to carrying all that power. Their capacity would need to be expanded by about 60% by 2050.

Orders of key generating equipment often face multiyear delays. And construction of new and expanded transmission lines has been very slow.

A Brattle Group analysis estimates all that new and upgraded equipment could cost between US$760 billion and $1.4 trillion in the next 25 years.

The reasons

The enormous scale of the work needed is a result of a lack of investment over time and delays in the investments that have been made.

For instance, since at least 2011 there has been an effort to bring Canadian hydropower to the New England electricity grid. Political opposition to cutting a path for a transmission line through forestland meant the project was subjected to a statewide referendum in Maine — and then a court case that overturned the referendum results. During those delays, inflation raised the estimated price of the project by half, from $1 billion to $1.5 billion — an added cost that will be paid by Massachusetts electricity customers.

That multiyear effort is just one example of how the vast web of companies that generate power, transmit it from power plants to communities, and distribute it to homes and businesses complicates attempts to make changes to the power grid.

State and federal government agencies have roles in these processes. States’ public utilities commissions oversee the utility companies that distribute power to customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversees connections of power generators to the grid and the transmission lines that move electricity across state lines.

Often, those efforts aren’t aligned with each other, leading to delays over jurisdiction and decision-making.

For instance, as new generators prepare to operate, whether they are solar farms or gas-fired power plants, they need permission from FERC to connect to the transmission grid. The commission typically requests technical engineering studies to determine how the project would affect the existing system. Delays in this process increase the timeline and cost of development and postpone adding new capacity to the grid.

The costs

A key question for regulators and consumers alike is who should pay for adding more electricity to the grid and making the system more reliable.

Utilities traditionally charge customers for the costs of generating and delivering power. And it’s not clear how much power the data centers will ultimately require.

Some large data centers have taken to paying to build their own on-site power plants, though often they can supply energy to the grid as well.

In some states, efforts have begun to address public concern about electricity bills. In November 2025, two utility commissioners in Georgia, who had consistently approved electricity rate hikes over the previous two years, were voted out of office in a landslide.

New Jersey’s Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill has pledged to declare a utility-price emergency and freeze costs for a year.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul has paused implementation of state law, driven by environmental concerns, requiring that all new buildings over seven stories tall only use electricity and not natural gas or other energy sources. Hochul has said that requirement would increase electricity demand too much, raising prices and making the grid less stable.

In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey has filed legislation seeking to provide energy affordability, including eliminating some charges from utility bills, capping bill increases and barring utility companies from charging customers for advertisement costs.

The solutions

Clearly, there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to this complex situation.

However, innovation in regulation, combined with new technologies and even AI itself, may enable creative regulatory and technical solutions. For instance, devices that can be programmed to use energy efficiently, time-sensitive pricing and demand monitoring to smooth out peaks and valleys in electricity use can potentially ease both grid load and customers’ bills. But those solutions will work only if all the players are willing to cooperate.

There are a lot of ideas about how to lower the public’s burden of paying for data centers’ power. New ideas like this need careful scrutiny and possible revisions to ensure they are effective at lowering costs and increasing reliability.

As the country grapples with the effort to upgrade the grid, perform long-deferred maintenance and build new power plants, consumers’ costs are likely to continue to rise, further increasing pressure on Americans.

For example, the United States typically welcomes between 25 million and 30 million real Christmas trees each holiday season, and each one reflects years of care.
In Oregon’s Willamette Valley, North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, and across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Christmas growers nurture trees for nearly a decade before harvest.
The result is a steady, well paced logistics environment that helps holiday tree markets in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee flourish.
The entire system closes the year with a sense of renewal rather than waste, reinforcing the positive environmental value of real Christmas trees.","Every December, Christmas trees do more than brighten our living rooms and anchor memorable family traditions. They set in motion a vibrant seasonal economy that energizes farms, retailers, transportation companies, and even segments of the construction industry. The holiday tree supply chain is fast, coordinated, and remarkably spirited, connecting tree growers, rural providers, busy logistics hubs, and joyful cities in one of the most cheerful commercial rhythms of the year. What looks like a simple holiday symbol is a nice story of craftsmanship, teamwork, and wintertime momentum across multiple sectors.

For example, the United States typically welcomes between 25 million and 30 million real Christmas trees each holiday season, and each one reflects years of care. In Oregon’s Willamette Valley, North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, and across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Christmas growers nurture trees for nearly a decade before harvest. These farms rely on wood products not just at the end of the cycle, but throughout it. Wooden stakes help young trees grow straight and strong, racks and pallets crafted from pine and hardwoods transport them to market, and lumber-framed stands welcome customers at retail lots. The entire journey has a warm, hands-on feel — an intersection of agriculture and woodworking that fits perfectly with the spirit of the season.

What makes this annual movement remarkable is how smoothly it integrates into winter business cycles. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, massive tree shipments often align with a natural tapering of outdoor construction activity as weather cools. Many transportation carriers pivot from moving heavy building materials to helping deliver holiday trees, creating an efficient seasonal flow that keeps trucks, drivers, and distribution centers productive during the transition from late fall to winter. Rather than competing, these industries complement each other for a few weeks, balancing freight demand in a way that keeps the regional economy humming.

In the Upper Midwest, the winter season creates an especially harmonious pattern. As temperatures drop in states like Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, outdoor construction helps free up some of the trucking capacity that tree farms need most. It’s a positive synergy, while some people and even some businesses shift toward indoor renovation work, transportation companies stay busy through tree shipments, and local retailers receive their seasonal inventory right on time. The result is a steady, well paced logistics environment that helps holiday tree markets in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee flourish.

The Southeast brings a different but equally encouraging dynamic. North Carolina, home to the popular Fraser fir, supplies millions of trees to states such as Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee. Construction activity remains strong in these regions during December, yet the coordination between tree growers, transportation companies, and large retailers has grown incredibly efficient. Many carriers build Christmas tree shipments into their holiday scheduling each year, ensuring that deliveries arrive fresh, consistent, and ready for families to bring home. Major retailers like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards, Costco, Target and Walmart have developed highly polished seasonal systems, including dedicated pallet inventories, specialized staging areas, and coordinated distribution plans. It’s an impressive display of planning that showcases how well American retail logistics adapt to holiday traditions.

These big box retailers are a particularly important part of the uplifting story. They become lively community hubs during December, not only in tree sales but in the shared sense of excitement as families pick the tree that will define their holiday memories. Behind the scenes, these retailers collaborate with growers and pallet manufacturers to ensure everything arrives safely and beautifully displayed. Pallet yards increase production in November, sawmills supply the softwood needed for racks and stands, and distribution centers transform into cheerful staging grounds full of fresh seasonal fragrance. It is one of the rare moments each year when an entire supply chain feels connected to something joyful.

Weather, which often poses challenges for construction, adds a positive seasonal rhythm to the Christmas tree economy. Northern states naturally shift toward different projects or year end planning as snow begins to fall, yet this frees time, talent, and trucks that can redirect into holiday commerce. Southern states benefit from mild winters that allow both construction and Christmas tree deliveries to proceed smoothly. Even snowy regions often turn winter weather into a festive advantage, families bundle up, head to tree lots for hot cocoa and fresh evergreens, and retail centers feel more alive with holiday energy.

The end of the holiday season also brings a thoughtful, eco-friendly cycle that highlights the industry’s sustainability. Different towns and cities across the country collect millions of trees in early January for recycling, mulching, and composting. Many communities turn these trees into material used for parks, gardens, wildlife habitats, and erosion control projects. The wood infrastructure used in shipping, pallets, racks, and stakes, is often reused or repurposed, creating another layer of efficiency. The entire system closes the year with a sense of renewal rather than waste, reinforcing the positive environmental value of real Christmas trees.

At the same time, the construction industry enters the new year with fresh budgets and a renewed sense of momentum. As tree farms wind down their season, building suppliers ramp up deliveries for January starts, and transportation companies transition smoothly into their next busy cycle. Rather than creating conflicts, the seasonal tide and flow between construction and Christmas tree logistics helps stabilize staffing, freight demand, and revenue across multiple industries during what could otherwise be a slower winter period.

When viewed through this lens, the Christmas tree industry becomes far more than a charming holiday tradition. It is a vibrant seasonal engine that supports growers, sawmills, pallet makers, drivers, distribution centers, retailers, and construction adjacent suppliers. It brings rural and urban communities together, strengthens local economies, and adds warmth to one of the coldest times of year. What begins as a small seedling on a hillside eventually becomes a centerpiece in a family’s home and along the way, it boosts industries, powers logistics networks, and creates a positive, collaborative rhythm that defines December commerce.

In many ways, the Christmas tree is an uplifting intersection of wood, construction, and holiday celebration. Its journey reflects care, planning, teamwork, and craftsmanship, reminding us that the best parts of the holiday season often grow quietly behind the scenes, connecting people and industries in ways we don’t often stop to appreciate.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2025-08/large-Robit-PLC-img-2022-Felipe-Martinez-001-MBN.jpg?h=da92c94c&itok=hkHCKp7_,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:07.599171

But survivors among clean-energy developers and energy efficiency retrofitters, along with makers of electric vehicles, batteries and building electrification tech, already are regrouping. They are being buoyed by falling costs, investor interest and the surprisingly durable momentum of the clean energy transition.

On Wednesday, a US federal appeals court even breathed new life into the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a legacy of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act that sought to stand up a network of green lenders that could reach deep into underserved communities. The funds have been frozen in Citibank accounts since the Trump administration tried to claw back the funds and cancel the program in February.

“Everyone deserves access to financing for clean energy projects that create good jobs, reduce pollution, and lower energy bills,” said Beth Bafford of Climate United, which had received the largest chunk of GGRF funding to finance community solar, energy retrofits, electric buses and other green projects in low-income communities.

A full slate of judges on the US District Court of Appeals will reconsider the case at a hearing in February. By a 2-1 vote, the appeals court in September had overturned a district court’s ruling in April that had issued, and immediately stayed, an injunction ordering the Trump administration to unfreeze the funds.

The reprieve came as clean energy investors and entrepreneurs are picking themselves up from a deeply dispiriting year. The nonprofit E2 estimates that at least $30 billion in investments, across 52 projects, have been lost since the Trump administration came into office in January. That doesn’t include collateral damage such as this week’s nearly $20 billion writedown by Ford Motor Co. Ford cited reduced demand for electric vehicles – including the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup – after the end of federal tax credits and the rollback of federal fuel standards.

A spate of high profile solar companies, from Sunnova to Mosaic to Brookfield-backed Posigen, have gone bust. The Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office is retooling $40 billion in loans and guarantees that were helping promising climate tech startups commercialize their innovative technologies and build first-of-a-kind plants to focus on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Many of the loans extended under the Biden administration have been rescinded.

Without US leadership, the COP30 global climate talks in Brazil this fall whimpered to a close.

As we wrote a year ago, “After four years of tailwinds, climate investors are about to see what they can accomplish in the face of gale-force headwinds.”

Project pipelines

To pick up the pieces, entrepreneurs are looking to cut fat out of business models, and investors are mobilizing new funds and coalitions to step into the gap left by the disappearance of public funding.

Green lenders, community developers and clean energy financiers had long claimed that many projects in their pipelines remain economically viable even without the federal incentives. They’re now combing through their pipelines of projects in community solar, building decarbonization, truck and school bus electrification and other green solutions to identify those that can be moved forward without the infusion of federal funding, as ImpactAlpha explored on an Agents of Impact Call in June.

Helping out are a slate of new funds with catalytic or flexible capital that could stand in for some of the government support. After months of closed door discussions, Energy Catalyst Fund I kicked off late this year with $50 million from the MacArthur Foundation and five family offices. The fund, managed by ImpactAssets, will make low-interest loans to advance green projects in low-income communities orphaned by the federal funding freeze.

“The need for energy financing has never been greater, with many projects requiring immediate funding to deliver an abundant energy future for everyone,” ImpactAssets’ Margret Trilli wrote in the firm’s year-end impact report.

The Deployment Grant Fund was launched in July by The Clean Fight, Builders Vision and Breakthrough Energy Ventures to accelerate deployment of climate solutions. The fund awarded a $175,000 grant to Texas-based geothermal startup Bedrock Energy to pioneer the adoption of its “geothermal-as-a-service” business model. A second grant of $125,000 went to Kelvin, a New York-based heating startup, to demonstrate the cost-effective electrification of an affordable housing complex in Brooklyn.

Both grants are matched by the customer with a mix of tax credits, local government grants, customer funding and private capital. “One of the most impactful uses of these small-dollar grants is unlocking additional funding to support projects,” The Clean Fight’s Kate Frucher told ImpactAlpha.

Among the most ambitious responses was the launch of the All Aboard Coalition, a group of top-tier climate venture capital firms organized by TED curator Chris Anderson to make bets on leading climate tech startups. The dozen or so coalition members, including Khosla Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, Obvious Ventures, and S2G Investments, will co-invest in geothermal, energy storage, marine decarbonization and other climate tech solutions that attract funding from two or more of the VCs.

The idea is to pool funds to help promising startups get through the tricky commercialization phase, often referred to as the “valley of death,” and to signal confidence to other big investors.

“We need a few people to join forces and be bold together, and the returns that we’ll get from that will be remarkable,” Anderson told ImpactAlpha earlier this year.

The coalition had hoped to clinch the $300 million fund by the end of October and make the first co-investments before the end of the year; it now expects both of those milestones to take place in January.

As ImpactAlpha exclusively reported, one of the recipients of Greenhouse Gas Reduction funds managed to get at least some money out the door before funds were frozen. The green bank network CGC, formerly known as the Coalition for Green Capital, was awarded $5 billion. In late January, CGC moved $2.7 billion to Apollo, Brookfield, Energy Capital Partners and a fourth investment firm, before the Environmental Protection Agency managed to freeze the bulk of the GGRF awards. The first deals from the four strategic partners are expected to come in early 2026.

CGC also invested $200 million in insurance firm Greenie Re to facilitate insurance coverage for renewable energy projects.

Climate United, which had sought to stand up a network of green lenders that could reach deep into underserved communities, has kept its door open with philanthropic funding while the lengthy litigation continues to play out.

At Climate Week NYC in October, climate tech investors, entrepreneurs and other leaders seemed energized after a bruising several months.

“I’m hoping that this is a helpful week to kind of get people back focused on deploying, on allocating money to these sectors and realizing that this is not a lost cause,” Bafford said at the time. “There is still a lot of great opportunity.”

Contrarian bets

The withdrawal of federal funding and incentives had the counterintuitive effect of increasing the appeal of climate investments for private investors.

“Times like these in history, for us, have actually presented the very best times to be investing,” Colin le Duc, a founding partner of Generation Investment Management, the $30 billion sustainable asset manager whose other co-founders include Al Gore and David Blood, told ImpactAlpha. Generation, and its specialized offshoot, Just Climate, see opportunities to scoop up clean tech companies with good management and long-term potential.

“The fundamentals of the sustainability transition are very much intact,” said le Duc. “We’re increasingly making the case that you really want to work with a specialist who’s got a long term mindset to seize this opportunity, because this is a long term secular shift.”

Other investors also see opportunity amid the federal pullback.

“If you’re sitting there with cash, it’s an unequivocally good thing, because prices are going to be lower, there’s going to be less competition, and you’re going to get better returns,” Galvanize Climate Solutions Tom Steyer told ImpactAlpha

Steyer, who has taken a leave from Galvanize to run for governor of California, has set up a broad-based climate investment strategy at Galvanize, spanning venture capital, private credit, sustainable infrastructure, real estate and public equities.

Chris Creed, the former chief investment office of the Loan Programs Office, joined Gavanize to launch a new sustainable infrastructure strategy earlier this year. “[Energy] Secretary Chris Wright and his team have been very clear as to their priorities,” Creed said at a recent conference. Those priorities are narrowly focused on a handful of energy sources, such as nuclear energy, oil and gas, and geothermal.

“That means my old pipeline of all of the other technologies in our taxonomy are not priorities, and they become investable options for private investors like us,” he added. Creed sees an opportunity to pick up and restructure some of the abandoned LPO loans, he told ImpactAlpha.

Rise of the rest

If US climate investors are swimming against the tide, the rest of the world is riding the rising demand and declining cost curves for renewable energy to a greener future.

At the COP30 global climate summit in Brazil in November, more than 80 countries, including most of Europe, backed a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels. The final agreement included only a reference to the “UAE Consensus,” where countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels.

Nonetheless, China is supplying its low-cost solar modules, EVs and batteries to eager buyers across Africa, Latin America and Europe. The Chinese automaker BYD, for Build Your Dreams, surpassed Tesla to become the world’s largest EV manufacturer.

India is seeking to halve its greenhouse gas emissions and increase its renewable energy production to 500 gigawatts by 2030, up from around 195 gigawatts last year. It is subsidizing households and offering tax advantages similar to those in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act in the US. India’s investment community is looking to create green jobs as it decarbonizes.

“That should be our focus – growth in jobs with clean technology,” India’s G20 representative, Amitabh Kant, said at last month’s gathering of the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association in Delhi.

Europe and the UK have taken on the role of defending climate progress, although the bloc faces its own fractious politics and pressure to backtrack.

Distributed solar generation, from pay-as-you-go solar panels to community solar projects, are addressing longstanding energy gaps in rural emerging markets. In Latin America, investors and innovators are capitalizing on the region’s deep roots to nature with solutions that draw on reforestation, regenerative farming, and bio-based alternatives to harmful products.

Just Climate launched its natural capital strategy, which raised $375 million in November, in Brazil. As the firm’s Eduardo Mufarej explained, “If you’re in the fashion business, you need to be in Paris or in Milan. If you’re in the climate business, you need to be in Latam.”

Just Climate leans into ‘natural’ strategies, with a Latin flavor

An analysis by Reciprocal and Breakthrough Energy Discovery identified 770 startups driving climate innovation, from smart lithium extraction in Chile to bio-based fertilizers in Brazil to satellite-driven biodiversity monitoring platforms in Colombia.

Such economic development opportunities increasingly are driving climate action, rather than a focus on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Some 63 million small businesses in India alone, account for more than one-quarter of the country’s total power consumption and represent an untapped $9 billion market for 15 gigawatts of installed solar capacity.

Globally, small and mid-sized businesses account for 90% of businesses globally, contribute more than half of global GDP, and sustain the livelihoods of two billion people annually.

“Across all of the climate solutions we’ve mapped out, small businesses are leading the way,” Climate Finance Fund’s Marilyn Waite, founder of the Global Climate Finance Forum, said at a side event at COP30. “And yet, they are left out of accessing the capital needed to scale their operations to have the most impact.”

In a guest post on ImpactAlpha, Waite’s colleague at the Global Climate Finance Forum, Meghna Parameswaran, cited startups such as Courageous Land, which has mobilized $35 million to scale biodiverse agroforestry across some 389,000 acres in Brazil, and the Vermi-Farm Initiative, which supports thousands of Kenyan smallholder farmers with climate-smart, waste-to-fertilizer practices, as “demonstrating what effective, frontline climate action looks like.”

Parameswaran argued for tailored blended finance instruments, technical and investor-readiness support, quality data, and support for small businesses in national climate frameworks. “We can cultivate the enabling environment these businesses need to scale their impact.”

Cost curves

A silver lining may be a renewed focus on creating viable business models that can stand on their own, with or without subsidies — as climate tech founders and investors have long insisted they have.

The falling cost of photovoltaic panels, for example, can make residential solar systems a financial win for homeowners even without the federal subsidies (many states continue to offer their own incentives). In the US, the median installation cost per watt of residential solar panels, before incentives, fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.53 last year, according to EnergySage.

The “soft” costs for residential solar systems could be cut further through streamlined permitting processes and direct-to-consumer loan products that eliminate the “dealer fees” that were often hidden in residential solar loan agreements. Those fees often padded costs by as much as 30%, so cutting them out would essentially offset the loss of federal solar tax credits.

“You’ve got that 30% tax credit that’s essentially eaten up by a dealer fee that can be 20%, 30% or more,” said Bill Paulen, CEO of Seattle-based LoanTERRA, which launched in October to help credit unions and other lenders make their own direct-to-consumer solar loans, without dealer fees. “This is too big of an opportunity, and there’s too much opportunity to clean up the financing in this industry.”

Similarly, the high cost of direct air capture technology, or DAC, is slowing the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. But In Berkeley, Calif., Aircapture is doing a thriving business capturing carbon dioxide from the air and selling it to industrial customers of CO2 for use in carbonated beverages, greenhouses, refrigeration, medical equipment and concrete.

“We’re going to market first into the merchant market, where prices are often high, where customers need a more reliable, higher parity supply,” Aircapture’s Matt Atwood told ImpactAlpha. “We think our go to market approach is the right way to be the low cost provider of this technology at scale when the infrastructure is mature.”",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2399599623-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 22:00:34.521799
,EPA,2025-12-18 02:18:57+00:00,The Columbus Dispatch,Data centers could dispose of water in Ohio lakes if state EPA approves,Maria DeVito,,,,,https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/environment/2025/12/17/data-centers-water-lakes-streams-ohio-epa-reviewing/87799939007/,"""If you're really concerned about our safety, safety comes first – not economic values that the data centers are going to promise us,"" said Barry Blankenship, who has opposed a data center in Trenton, Butler County.
""Because I can tell you, our lives are more important than a data center.""
Of the more than 200 data centers in the Buckeye State, only one – an Amazon Web Service data center in Fayette County – is currently on a similar permit.
Under this permit, OEPA says both wastewater and stormwater from such data center facilities would be covered.
But Ariss said OEPA has no information to date that shows water from data centers contains PFAS.","As Ohio's data center boom continues, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency is considering a permit to allow new data centers without access to central sewerage systems to dispose of water used to cool servers directly into lakes, rivers and streams.

The Ohio EPA on Dec. 17 held a public hearing on the proposed permit at its downtown Columbus office with about 25 people in attendance and another 100 people watching online. Nearly a dozen people who attended in person spoke, and several specifically were concerned about language in the the draft permit proposal that states lowering water quality ""is necessary to accommodate important social and economic development in the state of Ohio.""

""If you're really concerned about our safety, safety comes first – not economic values that the data centers are going to promise us,"" said Barry Blankenship, who has opposed a data center in Trenton, Butler County. ""Because I can tell you, our lives are more important than a data center.""

Kendra McKitrick, a bachelor's in geography graduate of Ohio University's Honors Tutorial College, spoke about growing up in Toledo and remembered a several day period in 2013 when the area was without clean water because of an algae bloom in Lake Erie.

""It was a scary and confusing time for everyone, especially a child, but to come into adulthood to realize those who are supposed to protect our environment are willing to sacrifice clean water for the economic growth of big data is horrifying,"" she said. ""Amidst this technological revolution of the 21st century, it is your responsibility as the EPA to protect our environment.""

The proposed general permit, which would be in effect for five years if approved, would not apply to most data centers in the state, the OEPA says. For example, data centers in central Ohio send their cooling wastewater to the city of Columbus's sanitary sewer system or some other central sewerage treatment provider. The proposed draft permit would apply only to data centers that can't connect to a sewerage system that would treat the cooling wastewater.

Of the more than 200 data centers in the Buckeye State, only one – an Amazon Web Service data center in Fayette County – is currently on a similar permit. But OEPA officials said this general permit, which data center companies would only need to file a notice of intent to tap into if they meet the eligibility requirements, is being done in anticipation of additional future requests because the state has more water line providers than sewer providers.

Under this permit, OEPA says both wastewater and stormwater from such data center facilities would be covered. OEPA says wastewater discharges include non-contact cooling waters that have gone once through the center or been recirculated water without contact with the process operations of a facility and is used only to convey heat from the facility, low volume wastewaters such as, cooling tower blowdown, boiler blowdown, and air compressor condensate [excludes some waste streams like sanitary wastes] and stormwater from industrial activities at the site.

The OEPA has not received other applications for individual permits, but state agency officials have had conversations and fielded questions from different communities across the state about the requirements for data centers, Walter Ariss, national pollutant discharge elimination systems manager at the Ohio EPA, told The Dispatch after the hearing.

""We're trying to be proactive, maybe not reactive to a particular industry that is looking to locate in our state,"" he said.

If the general permit is approved, any data center using it will still have to meet Ohio's water quality standards to discharge water into any surface water body. That means any water released would have to be treated to be cooled down or remove any chemicals that were added, OEPA officials said.

People who spoke during the hearing also raised concerns about PFAS, or forever chemicals, entering Ohio waterways. But Ariss said OEPA has no information to date that shows water from data centers contains PFAS. But he said if that changes in the future, the OEPA can change the conditions of the permit to address it.

The public comment period for the permit was originally slated to end Dec. 17, something that drew criticism from some members of the public who expressed concerns that OEPA was rushing the permitting process through ahead of the holidays. However, the OEPA said it has extended the comment period through Jan. 16.

To date, OEPA has received more than 2,000 comments related to the draft permit, Ohio EPA spokesperson Mary McCarron said during the hearing.

Moving Beyond 4-Hour Li-Ion Batteries: Expanding Energy Storage Duration in U.S. Markets.","◇ What is LDES?

According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) refers to technologies capable of discharging for 10 hours or more. As renewable energy grows, the challenge is not only adding solar and wind capacity, but also ensuring reliable power supply when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. LDES technologies are critical to enabling a resilient, decarbonized grid.

◇ Main Categories of LDES Technologies

LDES covers a variety of approaches. Each has its own strengths and limitations.

- Lithium-ion batteries

Today’s most widely used technology, best suited for 2–4 hours of discharge.

Safety and degradation continue to be challenges for longer durations.

- Pumped hydro

Large-scale and proven, but constrained by geography and long permitting times.

- Compressed air & thermal storage

Promising concepts under development, but commercial adoption is still limited.

- Flow batteries

Store energy in liquid electrolytes. Known for long life, safety, and scalability.

→ Sumitomo Electric’s Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) belongs to this category.

- Electrolyte tanks: Store positive and negative electrolytes. Increasing tank size expands total energy capacity (MWh).

- Cell stacks: Pumped electrolytes flow through stacks, where redox reactions occur to generate or store electricity. Adding stacks increases system power (MW).

- Vanadium chemistry: Vanadium can exist in multiple oxidation states, so both electrolytes use the same element. This minimizes cross-contamination and supports long life.

Key Benefits

- Flexible design: Scale power and energy independently.

- Long lifetime: Over 30 years of operation with minimal degradation.

- Safety: Aqueous, non-flammable electrolyte means no thermal runaway risk.

- Sustainability: Electrolyte can be reused and recycled, supporting circular economy goals.

◇ Sumitomo Electric’s Track Record

Sumitomo Electric has been a pioneer in commercializing VRFBs:

- First utility-scale VRFB in the U.S. (San Diego, 2017): 8 MWh system connected to CAISO, serving as a community microgrid with black-start capability.

- Large-scale projects in Japan: 60 MWh (2015) and 51 MWh (2022) systems in Hokkaido, stabilizing wind power integration.

- Global deployment: As of 2025, 49 projects across 7 countries, totaling 52 MW / 190 MWh, with an additional 44 MWh awarded.

Next-Generation VRFB – Lower Cost, Higher Value

- 15% higher energy density → smaller footprint.

- 30% cost reduction through design and manufacturing improvements.

- 30-year lifetime enabled by long-life materials and low-maintenance design.

The DOE has set a cost target for LDES of $0.05/kWh or less. Our next-generation VRFB is designed to help achieve this benchmark.

◇ Why It Matters for the U.S. Market

- LDES stakeholders

Flow batteries, validated through Sumitomo Electric’s global deployments, are among the most technically mature and operationally proven LDES technologies. They deliver long-duration energy at scale with minimal safety risks and little degradation, aligning with DOE’s targets for affordable and reliable storage.

- Utilities

Sumitomo Electric has demonstrated performance through its San Diego project, the first utility-scale VRFB in the U.S. Operating since 2017 on the CAISO grid, it provides peak shaving, renewable firming, black-start capability, and microgrid support, achieving more than 99% availability.

- Remote & Microgrid operators

VRFBs are well-suited for isolated communities and critical facilities, offering safe, non-flammable long-duration backup. In Cameron Corners, California, a 4 MWh system scheduled for operation in 2025 will secure power during Public Safety Power Shutoffs and support black-start functionality to enhance resilience.

- Commercial & Industrial users (C&I)

For commercial and industrial facilities, VRFBs reduce reliance on diesel generators, manage peak demand, and ensure sustainable long-term backup. With lifespans over 20 years and recyclable, non-flammable electrolytes, these systems support both operational continuity and decarbonization goals.

◇ Conclusion

While lithium-ion batteries remain today’s mainstream solution, flow batteries offer the safety, durability, and scalability needed for the future of long-duration energy storage. With decades of experience and continuous innovation, Sumitomo Electric is committed to supporting the U.S. in building a resilient, decarbonized energy system.

“I feel we did a disservice to the people of Louisiana,” Democrat Commissioner Davante Lewis said after the vote.","In a meeting marked by tense moments of disagreement, the Louisiana Public Service Commission on Tuesday approved a new regulatory pathway designed to speed electricity connections for large projects like data centers.

Proponents for the change say it’s necessary for the state to stay competitive and attract major economic development projects. Critics, however, say it weakens long-standing consumer protections and could expose residents to higher utility costs.

In a 3–2 vote during its monthly meeting in Natchitoches, the commission adopted a directive from Republican Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan that allows utilities to bypass the market-based mechanism they’ve used since the 1980s to demonstrate they are pursuing the least-cost power option.

The commission’s decision comes as state leaders actively court additional data centers, projects that could reshape Louisiana’s power grid, land and water use and rate structure for decades to come.

The change aligns with Gov. Jeff Landry’s “Louisiana Lighting Speed Initiative,” an executive order issued in September directing state agencies to streamline permitting and infrastructure decisions tied to economic development.

Supporters say the new pathway will help Louisiana compete for hyperscale data centers by accelerating approvals and providing certainty around power availability.

The directive sets an eight-month timeline for commission action on large-load applications and allows exemptions from market testing if companies meet specific criteria. That criteria includes: signing a 15-year electric service agreement, demonstrating a need for additional capacity, paying at least half the cost of new infrastructure and securing a letter of support from Louisiana Economic Development — an agency that directly supports Gov. Landry’s economic goals and policies.

But consumer advocates and a lone commissioner warned the changes prioritize large utilities like Entergy and corporate customers at the expense of existing ratepayers.

“I feel we did a disservice to the people of Louisiana,” Democrat Commissioner Davante Lewis said after the vote. “I think we tied our hands behind our back, put an eyepatch over one eye and then gave a wink to the utilities and these large hyperscalers with the other eye.”

Lewis had proposed a separate directive that would have launched a broader review of how large electric loads connect to the grid, how costs are allocated and what protections should be in place for existing customers. That proposal was deferred until the commission’s January meeting in a 4-1 vote.

But shortly before that vote, District 4 Commissioner and chair Mike Francis cut Lewis off during his discussion with a consultant, leading to a tense disagreement. Other commissioners could be heard having separate conversations among themselves as Lewis posed a series of questions about the process to develop his proposal and its regulatory intent.

When Lewis began to question the basis of passing Coussan’s directive, Francis intervened to thank the consultant in an apparent attempt to dismiss him. Lewis then told Francis that was unfair, saying other commissioners had been given ample time in the same meeting to speak.

To that, District 1 Commissioner Eric Skrmetta quietly responded, “I didn’t say s---.”

“Let’s just be respectful up here,” Lewis pleaded with his fellow commissioners. “I understand we have a difference of opinion, and I understand you’re going to kill everything I want to do, but let me talk. I’m over the disrespect up here.”

Lewis said his approach was meant to examine the full scope of impacts rather than carve out a single exemption.

“He was a slice of the pie, and I was saying let’s look at the whole pie,” Lewis said, referring to Coussan’s directive. He called the suspended market-based mechanism “one of our most basic protections that we have to the Louisiana ratepayers that has existed since the 1980s,” adding that the Commission “changed it in the blink of an eye.”

Consumer groups echoed those concerns. In a statement following the meeting, Logan Burke of the Alliance for Affordable Energy (AAE) said the directive removes “guardrails meant to ensure regular people don’t shoulder unnecessary costs put onto them by monopoly utility companies and multibillion-dollar corporations.”

Lewis warned that suspending market testing could allow utilities to pursue more expensive generation projects without proving they are the lowest-cost option.

“They have no obligation to come with the least cost option,” he said. “We have now given them pretty much a blank check.”

He also raised concerns about the eight-month approval timeline, noting that the directive does not define what qualifies as a “large load.”

“We could use this process for something as small as 20 megawatts,” Lewis said, “or something as big as 17,000 megawatts,” arguing that a fixed timeline could limit meaningful review of massive projects.

The AAE pointed to ongoing impacts around the Meta data center project in north Louisiana as a cautionary example.

“Residents are already seeing negative impacts from the Meta data center development, including extended power outages, drinking water discoloration and a severe increase in traffic incidents and public safety risks,” said Alaina DiLaura with the group.

Lewis said similar frameworks for large electric loads have been adopted across the political spectrum in other states.

“33 states have either passed some type of rules, or framework or tariffs around these larger loads,” he said. “This is not even a Republican, Democratic thing. This is about consumers.”

Looking ahead to January, Lewis said he plans to push for limits on the new exemption and clearer definitions.

Our community is already facing critical water shortages, and it is important to consider how developments like this impact our resources. The data center operation requires significant water usage, which further strains our limited supply.

“Earlier this month, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA) and Lion Point Capital, L.P. held discussions to advance a long-term development plan focused on clean energy, manufacturing, and establishing a modern data center hub in the San Juan region. NTUA's General Manager, Walter W. Haase, provided updates on support for energy generation, manufacturing, and the phased development of the data center aimed at fostering economic growth in the Nenahnezaad and San Juan Chapters.

Didric Cederholm, Chief Investment Officer and Founding Partner of Lion Point Capital, along with key team members, outlined an investment approach designed to keep Navajo institutions in control, while attracting major corporate partners and private investments. NTUA also reported progress on land readiness and permitting, noting that the primary tract has completed community resolutions, environmental reviews, and cultural clearances. Other land tracts are in early review stages, with ongoing coordination among Navajo Nation departments, which is vital for maintaining project timelines.

Economists have mostly been flying blind because of the government shutdown, but this week the data really start to flow again. In particular, we get a partial report on the employment situation in October and a full report for November, retail sales in October, and consumer prices in November.

Combined, October and November employment data will likely show modest continued growth in jobs. If you believe ADP, October will be up and November down; if you believe jobless claims, October will be weak and November better. Either way, it’s important to recognize that given the huge policy shift from lax to strict immigration enforcement, the push by the Trump Administration to thin government payrolls, as well as the ongoing aging of the population and layoffs attributed to AI, payroll growth should be slow.

In the meantime, the retail sales report for October should be relatively soft. Sales of cars and light trucks were the slowest for any month this year. However, it was not because of the government shutdown. Instead, federal electric-vehicle tax credits worth up to $7,500 expired at the end of September, which pulled many purchases into the third quarter. We will be focusing on retail sales excluding volatile autos, in particular sales at restaurants and bars, which is the only part of the report that covers the service sector.

On Thursday the Labor Department will release the Consumer Price Index report for November and might include some key data for October, as well. In addition to the headline figures, we will be looking at details that hint at new trends. In particular, is housing rent inflation continuing to slow.

Primary rents for actual tenants rose 4.8% in the twelve months ending in September 2024 but a slower 3.4% in the twelve months ending in September 2025. Given slower money growth in the past three years, this deceleration should continue. We see no threat of outright deflation, but the Federal Reserve will pay close attention to rents when deciding how much room it might have to cut rates in 2026.

At last week’s meeting, the median prediction from Fed officials was that short-term rates would only drop one more quarter point next year. Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in two cuts of that size. We think two cuts are more likely than one and there is even the possibility of three cuts. A new Fed Chair won’t have carte blanche, but if the economy and inflation both slow the case for more than one cut will be compelling.

As our readers know we believe the path of M2 is more important than the actual level of interest rates, and last week the Fed restarted quantitative easing, which should boost M2 in the months ahead.

In terms of President Trump’s pick for Fed Chair, what we would like to know is what the contenders think about reversing the regime of “abundant reserves” and the Fed paying banks interest on reserves. These policies were unnecessary for the Fed for nearly its first one hundred years, but its current leaders are adamant about keeping them after they were implemented in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-09, a crisis these new policies did nothing to stop or fix. Restarting QE seems like a shot across the bow to anyone who wants to alter course and return to a scarce reserve system.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential unified commercial platform and strategic integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, said, ""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential environmental-attribute monetization and digital infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream, said, ""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential multi-pathway SAF collaboration and offtake framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, CEO of Southern, added, ""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added, ""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

Member states are responsible for targets on corporate fleets, which also comes with uncertainty as the difference in adoption grows.
And member states will have to do their job when it comes to corporate fleets, too.
The proposed package requires approval of the European Parliament and member states.","1. What has been proposed and why?

The 100% ban on internal combustion engine cars (ICE) by 2035 will be lifted, while a 90% CO2-reduction from electrification remains. The last 10% needs to be achieved by using green steel or sustainable, renewable fuels.

The intermediate target of 2030 will be extended to 2032 by using credits averaging the target (banking & borrowing). Similarly, the EU previously decided to extend the 2025 target to 2027.

Sales of small electric cars, made in the EU, will be incentivised via so-called ‘super-credits’.

Member states will have to introduce binding targets for decarbonising corporate fleets by 2030 at the latest.

Lagging private demand, difficult market conditions and dependence on China are reasons for adjustment

European carmakers struggle to deal with the CO2-reduction targets in the current market, risking large fines and forcing them to push electric vehicle (EV) sales. The proposed adjustment to the CO2 regulation is an early review of the industry framework. Car manufacturers point to lagging demand for EVs; at the same time, the industry is being pressured in multiple ways as export and market stakes in the US and China are threatened, car sales at home are persistently low, and margins are subject to erosion due to less profitable electric cars and competition with Chinese brands.

Sourcing risks have added to that this year, with curbed exports of rare earth minerals and chips from China. The European automotive supply chain isn’t yet up to speed enough to reduce dependence and to deliver on the ambitions to source more from Europe.

2. What is the anticipated impact, and what does it mean for electrification?

The auto package will imply a further softening of the CO2 trajectory, although 90% by 2035 is still ambitious, particularly for lagging carmakers. It provides more flexibility for optimising the car sales mix along the way and opens up an opportunity to prioritise more profitable hybrids for longer.

Lowering ambition is a future risk

Softening the intermediate milestone for 2030 risks a slowdown of electrification, which is currently seeing decent momentum. Current policy requires a further drop from 90 gr/km in 2025-2027 to 49.5 gr/km in 2030 and 0% in 2035, which demands a rapid acceleration of around 17% in 2025 to 60% in 2030. This is now likely to end up lower.

Flattening the further uptake could also delay electrification of the fleet and CO2 emissions reduction from the car fleet, which takes us far beyond 2035.

Keeping other technologies alive and introducing new credits comes with complexity

From an industry perspective, the risk is that the package will slow down investments in EV technology as well as the general makeover of product portfolios, while keeping other technologies on the shelves (as well as associated investments). It may also reduce the urgency for lagging European member states to catch up in EV sales (and infrastructure).

For high-end and specialised cars, the new rules provide an escape route for the combustion engine, as they can pool their CO2 reduction efforts. To compensate for the final 10% of CO2 reduction from cars by 2035, carmakers could use credits for using green steel and renewable fuels. However, this creates complexity and will likely lead to extra discussions going forward.

Special support for small cars is a positive element for EV adoption

Addressing the need to sell more small cars is a positive step. Smaller electric models are less profitable and prioritised. The range of models needs to be expanded quickly to meet the needs of middle-class drivers and compete with Chinese brands. Counting small cars for 1.3 for the CO2 targets may slow progress elsewhere, but offering affordable new EVs alongside used cars will be a crucial part of the transition.

3. What’s the conclusion, and what’s next?

The auto package provides flexibility for the automotive industry in difficult times, but it also introduces uncertainty, risks reducing the push for EVs and delaying the scaling up of what is inevitably the future technology. Instead, other technologies – conventional cars, hybrids and plug-in hybrids – will be kept alive for longer while EVs eventually grow cheaper. The direction of travel won’t change, nor will the urgency to compete with Chinese competitors.

The plan introduces ‘pragmatism’, but complexity too, particularly in the final stages. Member states are responsible for targets on corporate fleets, which also comes with uncertainty as the difference in adoption grows.

Generally, an adjustment of the regulation just three years after the milestone adoption risks the impression that further adjustments may be possible. Auto industry body ACEA refers to a ‘first step’, and suppliers' body CLEPA still points to unresolved issues.

All in all, this signals the discussion isn’t over. And member states will have to do their job when it comes to corporate fleets, too. The proposed package requires approval of the European Parliament and member states.

Electric vehicle adoption has stagnated, especially for large battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
The future of Ford appears to be more of a hybrid mix of gasoline engines, electric motors and batteries than fully-electric vehicles.","Electric vehicles haven't been a huge victory for Ford despite solid sales numbers.

Between production costs and stagnant demand, it's time for a change in game plan.

Ford announced a major shift in its brand strategy on Dec. 15. Despite success in sales, the Blue Oval will be adjusting its business strategy to focus on a range of hybrid and gasoline powertrains instead of solely fully-electric models like the Mach-E SUV and F-150 Lightning electric truck.

The shift in strategy will cost the Big Three automaker $19.5 billion. Ford expects half of its global sales to be hybrids, extended-range EVs and electric vehicles. This would mean a 33% increase in hybrid, EREV (Extended-Range Electric Vehicle) and electric vehicle sales in the next half-decade.

What is an extended-range electric vehicle?

An Extended-Range Electric Vehicle, or EREV is a vehicle that uses an electric motor and large battery pack to move its wheels. The electric motor is supported by a gas engine that works as a generator to produce electricity once the battery runs low.

Gas engines extend the range of these vehicles by generating electricity so drivers don't have to rely on the battery life of their cars in the same way that EV drivers do. Unlike a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), EREVs only use gasoline engines to generate more power instead of relying on the engines as a main power source.

Ultimately, EREVs are electric vehicles that get enough help from gas engines to relieve range anxiety and eliminate the issue of getting stranded without an EV charger. They're the best of both worlds like PHEVs, but they lean more heavily on the electrical components of their powertrains than plug-in hybrids do.

Why is Ford adjusting its brand strategy?

Ford's adjustment echoes a broader industry shift and aligns with the strategies of companies like Toyota. The Japanese automaker has taken a cautious approach to mass electrification in America, lagging behind Ford, Tesla and Hyundai in the production on new EV nameplates and sales. Electric vehicle adoption has stagnated, especially for large battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

The Blue Oval's shift in strategy is a move to meet real market demand versus just responding to market enthusiasm. A new focus on EREVs and hybrids could make the brand's portfolio more appealing to consumers, as opposed to expensive large BEVs that can no longer benefit from federal electric vehicle tax credits.

What's happening to the Ford F-150 Lightning?

The Ford F-150 Lightning isn't getting the axe and will survive the strategic shift. However, it'll undergo heart surgery to align with Ford's new goals. The Lightning drivers know (and may love) is no longer in production, but it will return as a next-generation EREV.

This can be great news for drivers if Ford is able to reduce the Lightning's starting price by using extended-range tech. If the new Lightning is even pricier than its BEV predecessor, it may not be worth the money. USA TODAY Cars tested the 2025 F-150 Lightning battery-electric full-size pickup truck and found few weaknesses aside from a slightly bloated starting price.

The future of Ford appears to be more of a hybrid mix of gasoline engines, electric motors and batteries than fully-electric vehicles.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/USNK/87148343007-20210520-t-022938-z-1049786805-rc-2-ejn-9-dmd-6-w-rtrmadp-3-fordelectricf-150-1.JPG?crop=5499,3093,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-17 19:58:48.592362

Washington (December 17, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) today introduced the Lowering American Energy Costs Act. The bill directs the President to prohibit most U.S. exports of natural gas due to their contribution to rising household energy costs—a move that will protect consumers from utility price hikes and reduce greenhouse gases. This would not be the first time Congress has prohibited fossil fuel exports: in 1975, Congress passed a ban on crude oil and natural gas exports—a ban that was repealed in 2015.

The Lowering American Energy Costs Act is cosponsored by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Representatives Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.). Representative Clarke previously co-led the Lowering American Energy Costs Act with Representative Espaillat in the House.

“Fossil fuel billionaires aren’t just harming our health by polluting our air, land, and water—they're busting our budgets every month through massive exports of fossil fuels that drive higher prices on the international market and create sky-high prices for us at home,” said Senator Markey. “The Lowering American Energy Costs Act would put a stop to natural gas exports that are draining Americans’ pockets, polluting our planet, and destroying our chance at a livable future.”

“The Lowering American Energy Costs Act would have an immediate impact on Americans' energy bills, which have skyrocketed in the past year, with many households seeing double digit increases in the rates they pay,” said Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “While this cost explosion is unprecedented, the solutions are clear. We must ramp up renewable energy generation and ensure that American households are our primary and priority consumers, not AI companies or foreign purchasers. I am proud to join Senator Markey, Representative Clarke, and our colleagues to offer this legislation, which would reestablish the export ban on fossil fuels that was lifted in 2015 at the behest of billionaire oil barons, and lighten the cost burden that energy bills are having on Americans.”

“When each passing day of inaction increases the severity of the climate crisis and decreases our ability to fight back against it, solutions like the Lowering American Energy Costs Act grow all the more critical. Banning the export of our energy resources is a necessary step towards, at long last, putting American families, futures, and communities first, and I am proud to co-lead this legislative answer to an already existential problem. It's past time we prioritize the American people over someone else's profits,” said Representative Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09).

Several stakeholders joined the lawmakers in endorsing the Lowering American Energy Costs Act.

“This bill is exactly what American families need to help stop soaring energy bills, driven by unchecked LNG exports. By leading this important legislation, Senator Markey and Representative Espaillat are standing up for consumers who are being exploited by profiteering LNG exporters, while also protecting communities from dangerous and unnecessary fossil fuel infrastructure,” said Jim Walsh, Policy Director of Food & Water Watch.

“At a time when household energy costs are skyrocketing for millions of Americans, stopping the expansion of costly, polluting gas export infrastructure is paramount. We are grateful that Senator Markey’s Lowering American Energy Costs Act prohibits the export of U.S. methane gas in order to lower costs and prevent already overburdened communities from more pollution and harm caused by the unnecessary fossil fuel buildout,” said Claire Dorner, Associate Director, Legislative and Administrative Advocacy, Beyond Dirty Fuels.

“This bold, commonsense bill will help protect the health and pocketbooks of American families, who’re being ravaged by filthy fossil fuels,” said Camden Weber, climate and energy policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “By banning U.S. methane gas exports, this bill prioritizes public health, tackles the emissions driving the climate crisis, and shields Americans from soaring energy costs. Sen. Markey is showing true leadership by putting the American people above corporate profits while the Trump administration and complicit Republicans side with fossil fuel interests.”

The United States is the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world—the country’s eight operating LNG export terminals consume more natural gas than 73 million American households combined. Unconstrained exports of natural gas have a direct impact on utility bills for American households, as confirmed repeatedly by Department of Energy studies conducted in 2012, 2018, and 2024 and by Energy Information Administration analysis released last month from the Energy Information Administration. Since Trump took office, United States households paid $12 billion more for natural gas than they did last year, largely because of the continuing rise in LNG exports—an average of about $124 more per household.

Senator Markey has long been outspoken about rising energy costs for American households, as well as the harmful economic and environmental impacts of unconstrained natural gas exports.

In November, Senator Markey introduced the Stop Shut-Offs During Shutdowns Act, legislation that calls on electric and gas utilities across the country to immediately suspend shut-offs of service for nonpayment during federal government shutdowns.

In March, Senator Markey reintroduced the Heating and Cooling Relief Act, legislation to significantly expand and modernize the severely underfunded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

During COP29 in November, Senator Markey partnered with Representative Lisa Badum of Germany and Senator Rosa Galvez of Canada to lead more than 130 leaders from around the world in sending an open letter urging world leaders and UN-level negotiators to support an immediate moratorium on the expansion of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure worldwide.

In September 2024, Senator Markey held a bicameral meeting between the Senate Climate Change Task Force and the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) titled “Liquefied Fossil Gas (LNG): International and Domestic Impacts of the Rapid Rise in U.S. Exports.”

In September 2024, Senator Markey led a letter with over 130 global legislators calling on Biden to fully halt LNG exports.

In July 2024, Senator Markey sent a letter with several New England Senators to the Department of Energy urging it to consider the disproportionate negative impacts of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on New England as the department considers updates to its underlying environmental and economic analyses to improve export authorization decisions for LNG.

In May 2024, Senator Markey sent a letter with Senators Merkley and Reed to thank the Biden administration for its January 2024 pause on LNG export approvals to countries without a free trade agreement on hold until evidence is reviewed and public input is taken into consideration.

In December 2023, Senator Markey led an open letter alongside German Member of Parliament (MP) Lisa Badum and Canadian Senator Rosa Galvez criticizing the global proliferation of LNG infrastructure.

In May 2023, Senator Markey reintroduced the Block All New (BAN) Fossil Fuel Exports Act. This bill would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act by directing the President to impose a rule banning the export of U.S. crude oil and natural gas abroad—reinstating the export ban lifted in 2015.

Why it matters:

Many homes across the Palmetto State are unable to benefit from weatherization programs because of pre-existing issues, such as roof leaks, electrical hazards, mold, pest infestations or structural deficiencies that must be addressed before energy efficiency upgrades can occur.

Where the money goes:

Qualified nonprofit organizations that prepare income challenged households for participation in energy efficiency and weatherization initiatives applied for grants up to $20,000 through a request for proposals process launched in September.

City of Florence ($10,000)

Helping Florence Flourish ($10,000)

United Way of Hartsville ($20,000)

Sumter United Ministries ($20,000)

Citizens United for Redevelopment and Economic Stability for Chester ($10,000)

Emmanuel’s Hammer ($20,000)

Habitat for Humanity Greenville County ($20,000)

Habitat for Humanity of York County ($10,000)

Rebuild Upstate ($5,000)

“The Duke Energy Foundation grant will enhance the city’s Weatherization and Rehabilitation Program by funding critical home repairs for income-challenged households,"" said Jerry Dudley, planning director, City of Florence. ""Several homeowners are in urgent need of roof repairs. These grant dollars will help extend the reach of the city’s program, allowing us to serve more families and address essential housing needs.”

“Many homes in our state have underlying safety issues that prevent homeowners from participating in energy efficiency and weatherization programs that can significantly moderate energy bills and decrease the growing demand on the energy grid,"" said Tim Pearson, president, Duke Energy’s South Carolina. ""Recent legislative efforts have made it clear energy efficiency is critical to our long-term efforts to respond to growth in our state, and Duke Energy continues to look at new ways of expanding energy saving opportunities for our customers.”

Saving energy and money:

In addition to these grants, Duke Energy Progress launched a pilot program in South Carolina in 2024 offering free energy improvements to qualifying households based on income and energy use. And in 2025, Duke Energy increased incentives and eligibility for many of its energy efficiency and demand response programs in South Carolina, expanding ways customers can save money and energy.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs—much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.
In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city.
The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago—and everyday customers are eating those costs.

In this last election, climate change was a defining issue in states like Virginia and Georgia, where voters grappled with rising energy costs. And no matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs—much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago—and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74% between 2008 and 2024—and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40% in the past two decades—meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes, and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island—site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history—to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution, and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources, and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills, and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100% renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access, and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

Bolt is a data and energy infrastructure company co-founded by Eric Schmidt, former CEO and chairman of Google, who also serves as Bolt’s chairman.

“Our goal is to create the largest and most efficient data center company in the world by combining abundant energy production, efficient and scalable data infrastructure, and the largest land expansion runway in North America,” Schmidt said in a statement. “By partnering with TPL, Bolt will fuel the Fourth Industrial Revolution and protect and augment American leadership in artificial intelligence.”

‘West Texas is a global leader for energy production’

As part of the agreement, Bolt raised $150 million of capital and TPL invested $50 million. TPL will receive an equity interest, warrants, and a right of first refusal to supply water to Bolt-affiliated projects and related infrastructure. Bolt is seeking commercial partnerships and anchor customers to develop large-scale data centers on TPL land.

“Bolt represents a significant step forward in bringing world-class technology infrastructure to West Texas,” TPL CEO Ty Glover said. “With unmatched supply of both conventional fuel and renewable power, West Texas is a global leader for energy production. The region also benefits from a skilled workforce, a supportive regulatory environment, available water resources, and a strong entrepreneurial culture.”

Glover added, “We believe West Texas has the attributes necessary to become one of the largest concentrations of AI compute infrastructure globally, and combined with TPL’s ownership of nearly one million acres, our collaboration with Bolt is designed to help realize that opportunity. Bolt’s leadership, relationships, and proven experience in building transformative technology platforms make them an ideal partner for TPL.”

Schmidt outlined Bolt’s strategy and noted the advantages of West Texas and the TPL partnership.

“Bolt is focused on shortening the time between demand and delivery of compute at scale,” he said. “To be a reliable provider, Bolt will also focus on power production: natural gas-fueled, renewable, and ultimately, nuclear. TPL’s vast West Texas holdings and their expertise in land, energy, water, and regulatory execution makes them a uniquely capable partner.”

Land plus energy equals data centers

Texas Pacific Land Corporation is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with around 882,000 acres of land, the majority of which is concentrated in the Permian Basin. TPL isn’t an oil and gas producer, but its surface and royalty ownership provides revenue opportunities throughout the life cycle of a well. The company said it also generates revenue from pipeline, power line, and utility easements, commercial leases, and temporary permits related to a variety of land uses including, but not limited to, midstream infrastructure projects and hydrocarbon processing facilities.

Bolt Data & Energy is building an integrated AI infrastructure platform that combines abundant energy production, large-scale GPU computing, and scalable land expansion opportunities. The platform is designed to deliver reliable power, fast deployment, and consistent performance in the U.S.’s most advantaged energy regions. By linking energy ownership with advanced data infrastructure, Bolt said it is creating a pathway to the world’s largest and most efficient data center network to support the next wave of technological innovation and strengthen American leadership in artificial intelligence.

The palliative comes with an oft-repeated punch line—“Texas isn’t a red state, but a nonvoting one”—that even O’Rourke has voiced.
Those who are eligible to vote but abstain have outnumbered those who turned out for the highest vote getter in every Texas election this century.
But Texas is a red state because those who don’t vote, or who don’t often vote, are not, as a bloc, Democrats-to-be.
The Texas Democratic Party’s model estimated about 56 percent of 2018 nonvoters were Democratic leaning.","Here’s a story about politics that might challenge your assumptions. It’s about the race for the U.S. Senate in Texas in 2018, the last blue wave, when a large chunk of the electorate was angry enough at Donald Trump to show up at the polls in numbers not seen in a midterm in the modern era. By the time voting locations closed at 7 p.m. in El Paso on November 6, the campaign staff of both Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke had reason to be anxious: O’Rourke because no Democrat had won a statewide seat in Texas since 1994, and Cruz because his opponent had conducted a ferocious tour of the state and raised more than twice as much money, amassing a war chest that might have made Genghis Khan jealous. Then, before ballots were tabulated, the total vote count of 8.3 million was recorded—a turnout of 53 percent that shattered the percentage in all midterms in the state since 1970. As a person familiar with one of the campaigns relayed to me years ago, one candidate began to celebrate.

If you’ve followed Democratic politics this century, you might expect that the ebullient candidate was O’Rourke. The Texas Democratic Party’s conventional wisdom for decades has been that nonvoters tend to lean toward it, and that a campaign that could convince enough unconscientious objectors to exercise their rights could win. The palliative comes with an oft-repeated punch line—“Texas isn’t a red state, but a nonvoting one”—that even O’Rourke has voiced.

But the candidate who cheered high turnout on election night in 2018 was not, in fact, Beto. The Cruz campaign knew that there weren’t 8.3-million-divided-by-two-plus-one Democratic voters in the state, so if turnout was that high, there was no way he could lose. (A spokesperson for Cruz declined to comment on the anecdote.) And of course, Cruz was right. He did win. It was the closest statewide election since the nineties, but this was not, as Democrats often argue, because O’Rourke activated masses of onetime nonvoters. The real magic trick of his campaign was convincing hundreds of thousands of Texans who also voted for Republican Governor Greg Abbott to support him simultaneously—not enough, but no small measure.

Old canards, however, die hard. As we approach another midterm election during a Trump presidency, another Democratic Senate hopeful is preaching the message that Texas is a secretly blue state. Announcing her bid for the Democratic nomination to run for Senator John Cornyn’s seat last week, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett addressed “the haters in the back” of the South Dallas venue and explained how she could win a statewide seat though no Democrat had in three decades. “So they tell us that Texas is red,” she said, pausing, first as laughter erupted, and then to snicker herself. “They are lying,” she said, “We’re not. The reality is that most Texans don’t get out to vote.”

I was not there, but allow me, for a moment, to assume the role of Hater in the Back. Crockett’s claim is, bluntly, wrong. Texas is indeed a nonvoting state. Those who are eligible to vote but abstain have outnumbered those who turned out for the highest vote getter in every Texas election this century. The specific electorate changes every cycle, but as a group, the nonvoters are disproportionately young, poor, and Hispanic—three demographic segments Democrats have long assumed are likely supporters. Part of the reason some Texans don’t vote are voter suppression laws that make the state one of the toughest to cast a ballot in. But Texas is a red state because those who don’t vote, or who don’t often vote, are not, as a bloc, Democrats-to-be.

In 2022, when I asked dozens of local election officials, pollsters, political scientists, and political operatives for their estimates of the nonvoting population’s partisan allegiance, there was bipartisan consensus on the skew. The Texas Democratic Party’s model estimated about 56 percent of 2018 nonvoters were Democratic leaning. A GOP operative told me that lined up pretty well with his party’s estimate given its voter file, which modeled nonvoters by their consumer habits. (Do they shop at Cabela’s or Whole Foods? Subscribe to Garden & Gun or have a Sierra Club membership?)

To make up the large advantage Republicans have among existing voters, Democrats need to either drive huge numbers of those nonvoters to the polls while Republicans don’t or convince GOP-leaning voters to support them. Many campaigns try to do both, including that of Crockett’s primary opponent, state Representative James Talarico. JT Ennis, a spokesperson for the campaign, told me, “Ending thirty years of one-party rule in Texas requires a campaign that energizes the Democratic base, turns out new voters, and welcomes Trump voters who are now feeling conned.”

I asked Crockett about the balance of her strategy. “Nearly half of Texans don’t cast a ballot. Many feel that nothing ever changes or that their vote doesn’t matter. Frankly, too many politicians have relied on the same tired playbook of politics as usual,” she wrote. “By speaking directly to our shared realities, being unafraid in my advocacy, and unapologetic in my service, I’m earning the trust of a broad cross-section of Texans.”

When it comes to the turnout approach, there is no recent evidence, despite high-profile and expensive efforts to do so, that the Democratic party can outperform the GOP in getting nonvoters to the polls. Take the 2020 election, for example, the best turnout operation Democrats have ever run. That year, when there was a presidential race between Trump and Joe Biden, and Cornyn was last up for reelection, the party went all in on a strategy to activate low-propensity voters, those who are eligible to cast ballots but rarely do so. The state party invested a large chunk of its $25 million coffers into a voter model, which assigned each Texan a partisanship rating and a likelihood-to-vote score, based on prior electoral history. For those who were eligible to vote but had not registered—a number leaders said totaled 5 million (likely a twofold overestimate, which you can read more about here, and one Democrats have subsequently lowered)—the party estimated as much as 75 percent leaned Democratic. And then the party contacted all it deemed future Democrats.

Meanwhile, Republicans also saw fertile ground among the nonvoters. Steve Munisteri, the former party chair who had left Texas in 2015 to work for Senator Rand Paul and then for the Trump White House, returned to the state to assist with Cornyn’s reelection campaign and to help lead a turnout operation with Karl Rove, the electioneer who turned Texas red in the nineties. They focused some on the unregistered but eligible, setting up registration efforts outside places where Republicans gather, including Trump rallies and gun shows, and getting more than 200,000 Texans added to the voter rolls. (In Texas, voters don’t register by party, so the partisan allegiances of those they registered are unknown, but given where they were registered you can get a pretty clear idea.) They focused more heavily, however, on the 7.4 million Texans who were registered but hadn’t voted in 2018, targeting the 3 million the GOP’s voter model had flagged as likely Republican.

Unprecedented numbers of low-propensity voters went to the polls that year: The election in November was the highest turnout election by percentage since 1992, with 11.3 million of the state’s 17 million registered voters casting ballots. And Republicans swept every race—because infrequent voters in the state aren’t de facto Democratic ones.

In a postmortem report, the Democratic party noted that, according to its model of voter likelihood, Republicans were more successful at getting low-propensity voters to the polls. They were also better at getting new registrants to show up: While Democrats registered 150,000 more Texans than Republicans did, the GOP got 26,000 more people who were freshly eligible to vote to actually vote.

Why might that be? In 2022, I drove 1,454 miles, crisscrossing the lowest turnout counties in Texas, one of the lowest turnout states in the country, looking for nonvoters who could help provide an answer. I ignored the old wisdom to avoid discussing politics with strangers and spent days outside convenience stores, grocery emporiums, and dive bars asking whether folks planned to vote or not. The majority response was not yes or no. It was “What election is there?”

Many I met were lapsed but devout Republicans, voters who cared deeply about the oil and gas industry and gun rights but didn’t feel either were at risk and thus didn’t need to defend them. But I also met dozens of one-time Democrats who had suffered crises of faith and believed their votes didn’t matter enough to bother casting. Locally, these nonvoters told me, Democratic politicians who won accomplished nothing–streets remain unpaved, flood zones unprotected. Statewide and federally, some said, their votes didn’t count—Texas always went red anyway.

I met less cynical likely Democrats who told me they weren’t voting because no candidate had sought their vote, despite O’Rourke focusing heavily on turnout during his bid that year for governor. At the Reeves County Library in Pecos, I chatted with the receptionist, Mariana, beside a credenza where stacks of primary-election voter guides remained untouched, months after that election. Mariana was a college student who told me that her biggest concerns were the environment and gun control, and that she was on the “Democratic side of things.” But, even as O’Rourke, who famously vowed to seize citizens’ assault weapons, campaigned for governor, she insisted she wouldn’t vote for him. She explained she didn’t “know enough about the candidates” since “no one had reached out.” It’s unlikely any Democratic campaign would: Activating reticent voters is costly, and the party focuses most of its spending in large cities, where money goes further.

NCAR, founded in 1960, developed some of the world’s first weather and climate prediction models at its iconic Mesa Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado.
Today, its 830 employees work on programs ranging from storm prediction to air pollution, in addition to operating advanced climate models.
Although NCAR and UCAR laid off nearly 30 people in September, the center had largely avoided major cuts, Busalacchi says.
“Honestly, the majority of work at NCAR is not climate change related,” Pielke says.","NEW ORLEANS—Alarm spread fast today among climate scientists here at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU): President Donald Trump’s administration, they learned, was going to try to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), one of the world’s premier climate and weather research centers. The news, delivered last night via a post on X from Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, had come with no prior warning from the White House or from NCAR’s funder, the National Science Foundation (NSF), says Antonio Busalacchi, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a consortium that manages NCAR.

Vought’s post asserted that NCAR is “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism,” and said the center’s “vital activities,” such as weather research, would be moved to another entity or location.

Today, NSF issued a statement saying it would begin “rescoping” NCAR’s work to focus on seasonal weather prediction, severe storms, and space weather, while it would explore options to transfer operations of its supercomputer and two aircraft to other managers.

Busalacchi says the attack on NCAR is yet another sign of the administration’s “attempts to cancel the freedom of scientific thought. … That should provide a shiver down the spine of every U.S. citizen.”

Shuttering the center would be “an abdication of U.S. leadership” says Roger Pielke Jr., a longtime critic of climate activism who spent much of his career at NCAR. “There are fair criticisms to make about institutions of climate science but destroying them is throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” says Pielke, now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

NCAR, founded in 1960, developed some of the world’s first weather and climate prediction models at its iconic Mesa Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. Today, its 830 employees work on programs ranging from storm prediction to air pollution, in addition to operating advanced climate models. Although NCAR and UCAR laid off nearly 30 people in September, the center had largely avoided major cuts, Busalacchi says. He says NCAR quickly complied with White House directives on diversity, equity, and inclusion earlier this year by halting its Rising Voices Center for Indigenous and Earth Sciences, one of the programs singled out by the White House, according to reporting by USA Today.

“Honestly, the majority of work at NCAR is not climate change related,” Pielke says. He thinks the attack may simply be projection—that “the administration doesn’t like the idea of climate change, and therefore anything related to climate must be bad.”

This week, the administration also canceled $109 million in green transportation grants to Colorado, including money to improve electric vehicle charging infrastructure and study alternative fuels for trains. Some believe the sudden attention on Colorado is because of Trump’s desire to free former County Clerk Tina Peters, who was sentenced in a state court to 9 years in prison for tampering with voting machines during the 2020 election.

In a joint statement, three Colorado Democrats in Congress—Senator Michael Bennet, Senator John Hickenlooper, and Representative Joe Neguse—said the threat to NCAR was “deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory,” and that they “intend to fight back against attempts to gut this cutting-edge research institution with every tool we have.”

NCAR’s course of action remains unclear. Busalacchi says he is willing to speak to the White House, whereas Pielke says appealing to Congress, which has historically provided strong bipartisan support for NCAR, might be a more promising avenue. Pielke also envisions a scenario in which NSF, which funds NCAR on 5-year grants, continues to support NCAR while “micromanaging” its priorities.

Without NCAR’s strong presence, state agencies that did not previously specialize in weather and climate prediction may need to step up, says Abre’ Conner, director of the Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at NAACP, a civil rights organization. NCAR was “one of the last standing places … that would allow for our communities to get answers” about weather and climate-related disasters, she says.

The news moved at least one scientist at AGU into action. Travis O’Brien, an atmospheric scientist at Indiana University Bloomington, stood on the sidewalk outside New Orleans’s convention center with a hastily constructed sign, which he says he made to inspire NCAR scientists to push back against the White House threats. (He notes that his comments are his own and do not represent his university.)

“Closing NCAR will harm the American public,” the sign read.",https://www.science.org/cms/asset/c0a5c0f1-7680-4e43-8b6e-3d1900d73e47/_20251217_on_ncar_closure.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 20:58:58.109034

Integrated quality control systems at the forefront Quality control is integrated with the control center of the production activities.
Increased production capacity for BYD battery manufacturing BYD possesses greater production capacity than most of its competitors.
BYD batteries’ global position and impact explained 20% of the batteries produced annually are sold by BYD to other companies and used in international energy projects.
Due to its scale and their ability to control the quality of products, BYD is positioning itself to be an industry competitive benchmark.","Although BYD is an industry leader in China, Americans view BYD as a relatively small player in the United States. However, unlike BYD’s competitors, BYD is not only trying to sell cars. Rather, BYD is attempting to control the battery OEM market as well. BYD aims to monopolize the battery supply chain and disrupt the market with the unprecedented scale of battery production.

BYD’s strategic focus on battery manufacturing

This is mainly the effect of BYD’s Zero Defects program. It is the company’s leading quality program aimed at the systematic elimination of all production errors. BYD is trying to reach a stage where an automobile can no longer be fabricated due to production errors, and at that stage, all other small vehicle producers will have to depend on this company’s economically dominant battery production.

Battery production at scale

In the first three quarters of the year 2025, BYD produced 113 GWh of batteries, which is enough to power hundreds of electric vehicles, large-scale energy storage systems, and other forms of large energy storage facilities. This volume is produced without compromising quality. BYD is achieving this through focusing on the production process, implementing systems to control quality, and finding defects quickly so that adjustments can be made before the situation worsens.

Volume and precision must be achieved together, and this is what the Zero Defects strategy is built on. Throughout the entire production process, the company ensures that there is efficiency, consistency, and safe control of the process and products.

Integrated quality control systems at the forefront

Quality control is integrated with the control center of the production activities. The assembly lines, testing, and logistics systems are designed to minimize quality variations of the systems and materials to be processed, and this improves quality traceability. BYD wants to make its reputation credible, and because of that, they are trying to achieve quality that not only meets the compliance requirements of the local market but also the requirements of international leading – and more importantly, energy – customers.

Increased production capacity for BYD battery manufacturing

BYD possesses greater production capacity than most of its competitors. High levels of automation enable BYD to produce more batteries more quickly than its competitors without compromising quality or precision. Testing each battery for quality and safety is the next step in the production process.

BYD meets the demands of customers in every country it operates in and is more adaptable in catering to the needs of customers in other countries. BYD is efficient in expanding its international presence.

BYD batteries’ global position and impact explained

20% of the batteries produced annually are sold by BYD to other companies and used in international energy projects. Although BYD has no presence in the US automobile market, it supports the widespread use of electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage.

To promote the widespread use of electric vehicles and the adoption of renewable energy, a reliable battery supply is essential. BYD’s supply of batteries in large and consistent volumes extends its influence beyond the country’s borders.

Quality improvement through defect elimination

In the spirit of the Zero Defects program, BYD anticipates the problems customers will experience with new products. BYD meets safety and quality standards through continuous auditing and inspection of processes.

Instead of end-of-line corrections, BYD focuses on prevention by integrating quality controls during production. Due to its scale and their ability to control the quality of products, BYD is positioning itself to be an industry competitive benchmark. This allows them to compete globally in all markets on electric vehicles and energy storage, even in geographic markets where BYD does not sell vehicles.

The project is a joint partnership between the university and the Saint John’s Abbey.
Once that happens, it will allow Saint John’s to generate nearly 35 percent of its electricity through the steam produced as a byproduct of heating and cooling.
Even during the hardest weather, the system continues to operate as designed, which means that when all components are functioning properly, we should not experience electrical outages.” The STG project also qualifies for the Investment Tax Credit.
It was then transported to Saint John’s where it was lowered to be rolled into place by a 350-ton crane.","The energy-making capacity at Saint John’s University is about to get a giant boost thanks to the new steam turbine generator (STG) that was installed inside the power house on campus Tuesday (Dec. 16).

The skid containing the STG – which weighed in at 37,500 pounds – was lowered by crane then wheeled into place in its new home atop a gigantic concrete slab, marking a huge milestone in a project that has been underway since the older (and much smaller) turbine was decommissioned four years ago.

The project is a joint partnership between the university and the Saint John’s Abbey. The STG being replaced dated back to the 1950s.

“It was at the end of life, so we decommissioned it in 2021,” CSB and SJU Chief Facilities and Resilience Officer Russ Klein said. “After a year of discernment, we determined that even after all these years, our approach still made sense. We moved into design in 2023 with the intent to preserve that foundation, but to add a contemporary twist and benefit from advances in technology.”

The new STG is expected to be operational in April. Once that happens, it will allow Saint John’s to generate nearly 35 percent of its electricity through the steam produced as a byproduct of heating and cooling.

“The benefit is that it allows us to reduce expense and it does so in a way that’s both sustainable and operationally efficient,” Klein said.

“Then there’s the part that people don’t see, which is the resiliency benefit. When we lose power from Xcel Energy, we not only have our diesel backups, but we have the STG that doesn’t shut off. We produce steam reliably in all conditions. Even during the hardest weather, the system continues to operate as designed, which means that when all components are functioning properly, we should not experience electrical outages.”

The STG project also qualifies for the Investment Tax Credit. This is part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allows nonprofits to rebate up to 30 percent of a project’s cost.

“Overall, we’re going to be reducing our expenses while improving our resiliency to factors mostly out of our control,” Klein said. “This project is an exemplar of financial and operational excellence.”

Just preparing for the STG’s arrival Tuesday was a six-month process. It was manufactured in India, then shipped first to Pennsylvania and on to Michigan for packaging. It was then transported to Saint John’s where it was lowered to be rolled into place by a 350-ton crane.

In addition to the turbine, a new 15,0000-pound transformer is being set in place as well.

“It took a lot of prep work to get us to this point,” Klein said. “We had to pour a massive concrete slab because this (STG) is so much heavier and we needed to spread its weight across a large area. The floor (inside the power house) was reinforced. But we also had to shore up the pathway we were rolling it over from underneath as well. Then there was a lot of prepping of the electrical switch gear.

“So this was a pretty big undertaking.”",https://www.csbsju.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Steam-turbine-in-place-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 18:01:05.976667

Thank you for holding tomorrow’s hearing entitled “Examining the Impact of EPA’s CERCLA Designation for Two PFAS Chemistries and Potential Policy Responses to Superfund Liability Concerns” and for continuing your engagement on a very complex and challenging issue for communities and companies across the U.S. We support accelerating effective and appropriate cleanup of PFAS in the environment, based on the best science and risk management. We believe strongly, however, that applying the joint and several liability regime of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) to PFOA and PFOS, via EPA’s novel 2024 rule that listed PFOA and PFOS as CERCLA hazardous substances, would only delay those efforts.

We believe CERCLA is the wrong policy tool to address this issue:

· The EPA rule is unlawful for several reasons.[1]

[1] The Chamber and other trade groups are parties to litigation challenging the rule; our briefs and other materials can be found at https://www.uschamber.com/cases/energy-and-environment/cerclarule. See also. https://www.uschamber.com/regulations/coalition-comments-epas-proposed-rule-designation-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa-and

Among other things, EPA did not properly consider costs and consequences in deciding whether to utilize a never-before-used provision of CERCLA to designate the two substances as hazardous.

· The rule is not consistent with President Trump’s policy agenda for economic growth and prosperity, which includes rolling back excessively costly regulations, promoting U.S. manufacturing and national economic security, and unleashing America’s energy dominance.

· The rule triggers major costs and unintended consequences with far-reaching impacts for farmers, landowners, businesses, the U.S. economy, and our supply chains.[2]

[3]New Chamber Report Highlights High Costs for Communities Associated with EPA's Approach to PFAS | U.S. Chamber of Commerce

These costs are associated with, among other things, conducting response activities, complex litigation and protracted cost allocation proceedings, delaying closure of sites or reopening existing sites that have PFOS or PFOA or adding additional sites to the National Priorities List, and the opportunity costs every individual, business, or property owner potentially affected by the rule may incur.

· The listing would affect every real estate transaction for properties where PFOA and PFOS are potentially present.

· Litigation, and cost recovery disputes and activities, do not equate to actual cleanup. CERCLA is a particularly ineffective tool for driving cleanup of substances that the Agency has concluded are widespread.

We urge the Committee to consider more workable solutions that:

· Utilize alternative authorities that are more targeted for real, timely cleanup and that better fit with policy goals of both the Administration and Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, including the key objective of helping communities affected by PFAS contamination.

· Streamline the cleanup process to ensure timely and predictable approaches, and appropriate protection from the consequences of the rule for all parties. We believe that replacing the rule with alternative, more targeted regulatory approaches to PFOA and PFOS would be fairer and more beneficial for the environment and the economy.

· Make clear that all relevant costs and consequences need to be considered.

Finally, not all PFAS are the same. Production and import of PFOA and PFOS have largely been phased out in the U.S. for more than a decade. By imposing CERCLA liabilities on properties that include PFOA and PFOS, the rule triggered concern that EPA would do so for other chemistries with far different profiles, thus creating a disincentive to use many safe and effective fluorochemistries in critical products from airplanes to cars, cellphones, medical devices, and emerging technologies that will drive American energy dominance. DoD, for example, recently released an updated report on critical uses of PFAS, highlighting the complexities, timeframes, and challenges of transitioning from various PFAS applications.[4]

The Chamber has developed research corroborating the importance of such essential chemistries to critical sectors across the economy.[5]

The Senate voted 23 to 13 just hours after the Senate Appropriations Committee heard from a variety of entities impacted by the cuts.

State Senator Sarah Anthony took to Facebook Tuesday night to make the announcement showing bipartisan support.

Among among the impacted entities, Wigs 4 Kids, which provides wigs for children with cancer.

""We feel caught in the middle and were blindsided by the decision to recapture funds,"" Wigs 4 Kids CEO and Founder Maggie Varney said.

The city of Hamtramck also lost out on funding for a new fire truck.

""We are on the hook for an over $900,000 piece of apparatus that frankly my controller and I are trying to figure out how we are going to pay for now,"" Fire Chief Matt Wyszczelski said.

The cuts have received condemnation from some lawmakers of both parties in the Senate.

Democrats say the process lacked transparency and note a number of corporate subsidies were left untouched.

They also questioned whether the state can be relied upon after the abrupt cuts using a rare mechanism.

""Local governments, hospitals, nonprofits, workforce partners made hiring decisions, signed contracts with the state based on the reasonable expectation that these funds would be there,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chair, Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), said.

Senate Republican Appropriations Vice Chair Jon Bumstead (R-North Muskegon) echoed that sentiment, saying the legislature should stick to the promises it made.

“To me, a person is only as good as their word, and we can't lose that, we can't lose the people's trust,"" Bumstead said.

Ahead of the Senate's vote, Republican House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) doubled down on the cuts, saying they prevented Democrats from using the projects to grow what's he's labeled ""slush funds.""

“We need to eliminate a lot of this pork spending, get it under control,” Hall said. ”We need to be spending money on really the core essential needs of state government.”

The senate's action, unlike the house's, still needs to be approved by the opposite chamber.

Attempts by House Democrats to get the measure to the floor for a vote failed Wednesday.

The outcome seemed likely as Hall reiterated his position in a statement Tuesday night.

“The Senate Democrats are so addicted to pork and their secret slush funds that they just voted to reinstate the waste, fraud, and abuse that House Republicans fought to eliminate,"" Hall said. ""Ultimate Lansing insiders like Sarah Anthony continue to do the bidding of lobbyists and the radical left special interests. Not the taxpayers. This isn’t surprising at all.”

House Democrats have proposed a bill to prevent the unilateral use of the appropriations mechanism again.

Senate Democrats also sent a letter to Attorney General Dana Nessel seeking guidance on whether the house's unilateral cuts were legal.

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.

The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect ... Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”

That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.

Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting ... intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

Most North Carolina counties shrank in population between 2010 and 2020, even though the state’s population as a whole skyrocketed.
On Wednesday, Cervania told them to reconsider how they can square that stance with these other concerns over property taxes.","A bipartisan committee of North Carolina lawmakers met for the first time Wednesday to begin the process of examining state laws governing property taxes — part of an effort to deliver financial relief to homeowners without harming municipal services.

The House Select Committee on Property Tax Reduction and Reform was created last week and kicked off Wednesday with a presentation on what the state’s already doing with some targeted property tax relief programs — to the tune of more than $100 million a year, mostly spent on seniors and military veterans — as well as presentations on what other states are doing.

Concerns over senior citizens were a key focus of the meeting. Many older Americans no longer work and are living on a fixed income of Social Security payments in addition to any other pensions or investments they may have. Many have also lived in the same home for decades and in some cases no longer have mortgage payments. But rising property values have caused property taxes to rise as well, increasing their bills.

“We’ve got to shift, to make them be able to age in place,” Rep. Carla Cunningham, D-Mecklenburg, said. “I think that's what a lot of seniors are dealing with. They can't stay in their home because it's too expensive.”

Younger people, as well as those unable to afford a home, also received some attention at the meeting. Several lawmakers noted that one reason rents have risen in recent years is that landlords are passing off property tax hikes onto their renters — something that could apply to people renting homes and apartments, as well as to businesses renting space.

“It's affecting not only potential homeowners or current homeowners,” Rep. Erin Paré, R-Wake, said Wednesday. “It’s also impacting renters, and even small businesses who rent. That cost gets pushed off on them. So this is a big deal.”

In recent years, Republican state lawmakers have rewritten tax laws to reduce income taxes and expand the list of things people have to pay sales taxes on. But the state legislature has so far made few changes related to property taxes.

Housing affordability is a growing and bipartisan political issue, however, and the committee intends to show voters that the legislature is paying attention to the issue as the 2026 elections approach, when every state lawmaker will be up for reelection.

Unlike income tax and sales tax revenue, property tax revenue doesn’t go to the state. The money stays in the cities and counties that collect those taxes, helping fund local schools, parks, police, sheriffs and more. And individual cities and counties — not the state legislature — are in charge of setting local property tax rates.

A broad effort to lower property taxes could lead to budget cuts for schools and police. This new push is expected to be more targeted. State House Speaker Destin Hall said in a statement last week that the new committee would look into “practical ways to reduce the burden on homeowners without undermining local services.”

A group that lobbies on behalf of cities and counties, the North Carolina League of Municipalities, is wary of any proposals that might cut into their ability to collect taxes. Scott Mooneyham, a league spokesman, told reporters after Wednesday’s hearing that about half of all municipal spending goes to public safety — police departments, sheriff’s offices and fire departments.

“It is impossible to substantially alter property taxes in the state of North Carolina without defunding the police,” he said.

In some parts of the state — especially in more rural areas — a lack of new development or the loss of people and businesses have forced local leaders to raise rates on those who remain.

Most North Carolina counties shrank in population between 2010 and 2020, even though the state’s population as a whole skyrocketed. The fastest-growing parts of the state, meanwhile, have been able to keep property tax rates low as new development has broadened the base of what can be taxed.

But even in Wake County — which has among the lowest property tax rates in North Carolina, and whose residents are the wealthiest in the state — some lawmakers are still concerned with the impact of any potential rate hikes. That is, in part, because Wake County also has higher property values than most of the rest of the state.

Rep. Maria Cervania, D-Wake, is a former Wake County Commissioner. She noted that most of what any county in North Carolina pays for — schools and law enforcement make up the vast majority of county spending — are also supplemented by state and federal funds. But as Republicans have slashed taxes and spending at the state and federal levels, she said, that has forced cities and counties to step up and fill those gaps.

GOP leaders in the state legislature are currently debating whether to keep lowering income tax rates. On Wednesday, Cervania told them to reconsider how they can square that stance with these other concerns over property taxes.

“That is what, I believe, is a large part of the increases in our counties and municipalities, in terms of their tax rate,” she said. “So we need to look at ourselves, too, in this responsibility. I don't know what the answer is, but it's a balance.”",https://images.wral.com/asset/5oys/2025/11/17/22250701/Homeowner__Unsplash-DMID1-690yygzjf-4592x3448.jpg?w=1200&h=630&height=630,N,,2025-12-17 19:59:27.878057

What is Project Matador?

Project Matador, also known as the President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus is under construction about 12 miles northeast of Amarillo. As of the time this blog is released, if actually constructed, it would be the largest data center on earth, and it would be powered by the largest combination of gas, nuclear, solar and battery storage facilities ever built. The key word is “if.”

December 4 Community Meeting in Panhandle

On December 4, 2025, hundreds of local residents, along with some college students bused in by the company behind the project, gathered at a community center in the town of Panhandle, adjacent to the proposed 5,236-acre site. The meeting focused on one of the first required permits for the project: a series of air quality permits that would allow Fermi America to build and operate 93 gas-fired turbines around the perimeter of the AI data center. If actually constructed, the facility’s more than 5,100 MW of gas capacity would make it the largest gas plant in the United States.

While Lone Star Chapter staff members were unable to attend the meeting, we’ve been in discussions with community members who attended to express their concerns about the data center’s technology, the high number of proposed gas plants, and the looming threat of water loss due to the demand of the gas plants and data centers themselves. The project involves building power plants to attract the AI and data centers. Fermi itself does not propose to build the data centers.

Heading up the project, and playing the role of Head Cheerleader, is Rick Perry. His co-pilot is co-founder and fellow investor Toby Neugebauer, the founder of Quantum Energy Partners, a private energy equity firm that invested heavily in oil and gas particularly in the Barnet Shale. Neugebauer is also a top donor to politicians like Perry and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Rounding out the team is the community liaison, former Amarillo Mayor Trent Sisemore, who operates Fermi out of a humble office in Amarillo just above a local bank.

According to the TCEQ database, over 279 comments from community members were received - the bulk of them in opposition - including 63 requests for a contested case hearing, as well as 21 requests for another public meeting.

The office of Fermi America can be found on the third floor of this historic office building.

Concerns About Air Quality and Gas Turbines

Fermi’s requested permits are unusual in that the company is seeking one “PSD” permit to operate over 5100 MWs of gas, even though many of the turbines are separately operated as “six-on-one” units that collectively act like combined cycle power plants. (In addition, the company also has a separate permit to authorize global warming gas emissions).

Utility energy efficiency plans should be easier to read now.
As part of our filing, we turned in comments from more than 600 Texans calling for change and expansion of the energy efficiency programs.
Centerpoint Settlement Agreement At the PUCT The PUCT also adopted a settlement agreement between the Sierra Club, City of Houston, and Centerpoint Energy on Centerpoint’s 2026 energy efficiency programs.
Sierra Club reached a similar agreement with AEP Texas in their 2026 energy efficiency case, though we are waiting for the Commission to formally adopt the order.","On Friday, December 12, the Public Utility Commission of Texas finally kept a promise they had made back in 2021 - assess and make changes to the energy efficiency and “load management” programs that the state’s eight private transmission and distribution utilities are required to run under Texas law. These are the programs that many thousands of Texans use to weatherize their homes, reduce their electricity bills, and help the environment in the process by relying less on polluting power plants.

While the commission made it clear this was just the first step in the process, the new rules adopted under Project No. 57743, make five important changes:

More realistic savings estimates should mean more money goes to programs - not huge performance bonuses for big utilities. The most important change is ERCOT’s calculation of the avoided cost of energy is now based on seven years of data - not just two - and is calculated in April rather than in November, giving more time for utilities to actually plan their programs with cost data in hand. Because the avoided cost of energy drives the determination of whether programs are cost-effective, but also the “incentive” that utilities can earn by exceeding the modest goals set in statute, utilities were routinely earning “bonuses” that were eating up the budgets intended to help their customers save energy. In the most recent round of annual energy efficiency programs scheduled for 2026, about a third of the overall budgets were dedicated to these incentives, driven by the high cost of energy in recent years. Averaging the cost of energy over seven years provides a much better baseline.

More limits placed on what utilities can charge Texans to benefit themselves. The rules also limit the benefit or incentive utilities can earn to 5 percent of the net benefit of the program, reducing it from 10 percent. Because net benefit is based on the benefits to the utilities, staff proposed limiting those incentives to a more reasonable level. While it is too early to tell the effect, incentives that were routinely in the 30 to 40 percent level will likely be in a more reasonable 10 to 15 percent incentive with this change.

More Texans could qualify for special energy savings incentives. The amendments also clarify the distinction between targeted low-income programs and a program for hard-to-reach customers. Under the changes in definition, low-income customers who have historically been served by hard-to-reach programs should continue to be included as potential hard-to-reach customers, but the adopted rule also expands the proposed definition of ""hard-to-reach"" so that utilities can expand their programs beyond the traditionally served low-income customers to those that may not have been served historically, including rural landowners, and small businesses with a demand less than 50 KW.

More Texans could be eligible for free weatherization programs. The updated rule refines the definition of low-income customer to be based on a calculation of 80% of the area median income, or resides in a household in which at least one person receives economic assistance through a program listed in the Texas technical reference manual (TRM) for the applicable program year. Existing §25.5 also includes a definition for ""low-income customer"" that is based on whether the customer qualifies for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka, SNAP) or medical assistance from a state agency. In essence, with this change in definition, more Texans should have access to “free” weatherization programs in Texas.

Utility energy efficiency plans should be easier to read now. Finally, the updated rule creates a new template that utilities must use when they file their annual energy efficiency plan, making it easier for the public to understand what is being proposed by the utility for upcoming years.

While modest, the Sierra Club, the South Central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource, the Office of Public Utility Counsel, the City of Houston, the American Council on an Energy Efficient Economy, and others were largely supportive of the rule change, even as the utilities themselves disagreed with some of the changes related to the incentives. In adopting the rules, both Chairman Gleeson and Commissioner Kathleen Jackson praised staff - and stakeholders - for finally taking on the programs, which are another important tool to assure affordability and reliability.

The PUCT is not done, and in its reply to the Sierra Club comments, the Commission noted that many additional issues raised by the Sierra Club - including energy savings goals, cost caps, and the difference between ERCOT and non-ERCOT utilities - will be addressed in future rulemaking. As part of our filing, we turned in comments from more than 600 Texans calling for change and expansion of the energy efficiency programs. Thanks!

How Long Does Rulemaking Take?

It was back in December 2021 that the Commission adopted its blueprint for reliability reforms, which included a provision that it would make its “energy efficiency” programs more “efficient.” However, when the Commission took no action, the Sierra Club first initiated a petition for rulemaking in 2022, and then attempted to pass legislation in both 2023 and 2025 to reform and expand the energy efficiency programs. While the PUCT rejected the petition for rulemaking, and only the Senate advanced energy efficiency legislation, the action last week marked the first major change to the programs in more than 15 years. The Sierra Club is not giving up and will continue to press for further changes in 2026.

Centerpoint Settlement Agreement At the PUCT

The PUCT also adopted a settlement agreement between the Sierra Club, City of Houston, and Centerpoint Energy on Centerpoint’s 2026 energy efficiency programs. Under the agreement, Centerpoint Energy agrees to spend more than $50 million on energy efficiency programs in 2026, while keeping a healthy $40 million in incentives, allowed under the rules before they were just changed. We argued strenuously that Centerpoint should spend more on programs that help Texans and less on bonuses for themselves, but in the end the wealthy utility will take more than 40% of their energy efficiency budget as a bonus for the next year. However, Centerpoint Energy will continue to conduct a market potential study on energy efficiency in its service territory, meet with the Sierra Club to review its programs and consider improvements, provide information to customers about potential federal funding available through the State Energy Conservation Office, and hold a public meeting in the Houston area to help customers learn about how to access Centerpoint Energy programs. A copy of the settlement can be found here.

Sierra Club reached a similar agreement with AEP Texas in their 2026 energy efficiency case, though we are waiting for the Commission to formally adopt the order. In both cases, while we are unable to reduce the very large bonuses for the utilities in 2026, the changes in rules will prevent such large bonuses or incentives from occurring in the future!",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-12/logoseal_color-150-1.png.webp?itok=GyLfLKH-,N,,2025-12-17 19:04:16.502852

LISTEN: EL PASO MATTERS PODCAST","By Salvador López Córdova

Along the U.S.-Mexico border, communities like El Paso and Ciudad Juárez — much like other pairs of “sister cities” — are bound by deep historical, cultural and family ties, as well as a vibrant regional economy that supports tens of thousands of jobs and sustains a significant share of bilateral trade.

That economic engine continues to show remarkable strength. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, the state of Chihuahua exported more than $26 billion in goods — an increase of 43% compared with the same quarter of 2024, according to the latest data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography, or INEGI. These numbers reflect a robust industrial base fully integrated into North American supply chains.

Yet it is equally important to recognize that this dynamic economy places pressure on local infrastructure and the quality of life for border residents. The region’s interdependence, the inherently cross-border nature of its economic activity and the fact that both countries share natural resources and air basins, all underscore a shared responsibility to push for a more prosperous future, while also ensuring clean water, air and land for all.

At the North American Development Bank, or NADBank, we support infrastructure projects that deliver a triple benefit: strengthening economic competitiveness, improving quality of life and enhancing general well-being. To advance this mission, we provide financing, as well as technical assistance that helps border communities generate the data and expertise needed to pursue long-term solutions.

Such solutions require several key ingredients: vision, leadership and political will; interagency — and in many cases, international — coordination; and, critically, access to reliable data to support informed decision-making.

The Paso del Norte Joint Advisory Committee, or JAC, offers a clear example of what is possible when these elements come together. The JAC brings together all levels of government, academia and civil society across three states and two countries. It functions as a community-based body overseeing efforts to secure cleaner air for the entire Paso del Norte region.

NADBank has supported the JAC’s mission as a core partner in establishing the Air Quality Monitoring Fund — initially financed through contributions from NADBank and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The fund has enabled the expansion and ongoing operation of Juárez’s air-monitoring network: increasing the number of monitoring stations from four to five, ensuring continuous measurements and providing public reporting for three years. With this information, local authorities, experts and the public can assess risks in real time and plan appropriate actions.

We also provided technical assistance for the development of the Social and Environmental Indicators Dashboard for Ciudad Juárez, created by Rice University and Tecnológico de Monterrey. This tool makes it possible to analyze and visualize key information that reveals how economic, social and environmental factors interact within the city.

Similarly, NADBank supported a pilot study on zero- and low-emission trucks for the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo corridor, one of the most important international trade corridors between the two countries. Conducted by Texas A&M University and the Texas Transportation Institute, the study identifies financially viable opportunities for reducing emissions at border crossings through technological upgrades and logistical improvements.

The border economy is well-positioned to continue growing. Its strong industrial foundation, skilled workforce and strategic location give the region a unique advantage. Our role, as a development bank, is to support the knowledge and infrastructure that will allow this growth to flourish while ensuring that border residents can also thrive with clean, healthy air to breathe.

At NADBank, we understand that lasting progress begins at the local level. That is why we will continue to strengthen partnerships, support projects that bring technical clarity and offer financing solutions tailored to the needs of El Paso, Juárez and all border communities.

Salvador López Córdova is the chief environmental officer at NADBank.

So spread the word because it’s not just about people buying EVs: consumers are also voters.","During the Biden Administration, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, two pieces of legislation that led to an unprecedented level of public- and private-sector clean energy investments, including boosting domestic electric vehicle (EV), battery, and supply chain manufacturing; expanding EV charging infrastructure; and incentivizing EV, truck, and bus adoption.

And they worked. These policies have spurred more than $292 billion in private-sector clean energy investment across 49 states, with anticipated job creation of approximately 358,000 — progress now in jeopardy.

In 2025, the policy landscape changed. The Trump Administration has led the crusade to deliver a gut punch to the EV market and eviscerate the Biden-era policies, regulations, and incentives that have helped boost EV market momentum. The current administration has taken unprecedented steps to undermine the Clean Air Act, loosen federal fuel-efficiency standards, revoke states’ rights to set stricter tailpipe emissions standards, and eliminate incentives such as EV tax credits that have helped new- and used-car shoppers switch to EVs.

Make no mistake, the oil industry is driving the rollback of supportive EV policies and regulations. Oil companies are increasingly concerned as EVs displace the internal combustion engine, which is the oil industry’s largest customer. Their concern is warranted, given that more than one in four cars sold globally this year will be EVs. In America, where the oil industry has outsized political influence, it is leveraging that power to slow the transition to electric transportation and hinder the EV market’s expansion.

Hinder as they may, the oil industry and their paid-for politicians can’t halt the shift to EVs.

The ABCs of EVs

Despite the political whipsawing, the latest J.D. Power consumer interest survey shows that 24% of active shoppers say they are “very likely” to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months. Consumer interest remains strong because EVs have proven to be more affordable, better, and more convenient than the old technology:

Affordable—Driving an EV saves the average consumer $1,000 annually in avoided gasoline costs and hundreds of dollars more in avoided maintenance.

Better—EVs are technologically cutting-edge, high-performing, and fun to drive, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions upwards of 80% compared to gas cars.

Convenient—For most EV owners, 80% of EV charging occurs at home while they sleep; the average EV range has tripled over the past decade to approximately 300 miles; and public EV charging infrastructure has expanded to over 234,000 ports nationwide.

A is for Affordability, U is for Used

Affordability remains a priority for Americans, regardless of political ideology. In the recent November elections, voters ousted incumbents they blamed for rising bills and elected candidates they trusted to make life more affordable. With voters demanding that elected officials address affordability and consumer interest in EVs remaining unshakeable, the EV market has an ace up its sleeve: The best way for consumers to lower their energy and transportation costs is to ditch gas and switch to EVs, especially used ones.

Over the past three years, consumers have leased millions of new EVs. As these leases expire, most leased EVs will enter the used-car market, where two-thirds of consumers buy cars. Used EVs already compete with gas vehicles on price and outperform them on value, meaning many consumers priced out of the new-vehicle market now have access to more affordable EV ownership.

In 2025, 243,000 EV leases will end, more than 3 times the number that ended in 2024. In 2026 and beyond, the used EV market will continue to expand rapidly as the surge in new EV leases over the past five years drives growth in the used market. And because 92% of EV owners plan to buy another EV for their next car, the expanding used-EV market will significantly increase the total number of EVs on the road.

Spreading the Word

With EV owner satisfaction high, consumer interest holding, and the affordable used EV market growing, we can weather the current political anti-EV storm, provided we can overcome the consumer awareness barrier, cut through EV disinformation and hostile rhetoric, and communicate the ABCs of EVs widely. But it remains undeniable that we need reliable government support to build a robust domestic EV market that provides consumers with clean and affordable transportation options, keeps American auto and supply chain businesses competitive globally, secures domestic supply chains, and delivers good-paying jobs.

We need to meet consumers where they are, with compelling, persuasive stories about how the transition to EVs will make their transportation more affordable, better, and more convenient. The right stories about the ABCs of EVs, told in the right places by the right voices, can cut through the anti-EV noise and convince consumers that EVs are a critical part of the affordable future they want. EV communications work is underway at the national and regional levels. Examples of existing campaigns include Clean Energy Generation, Energy for All Y’all, Electric For All, and Electrify Your Ride. Each is doing a good job, in its own way, of meeting the moment. But we need much more: funding, collaboration, and scale to reach deep into mainstream America.

Another ace up the sleeve

Meanwhile, there is another ace up the EV market’s sleeve—the 92% of happy EV owners. If you are one of them, talk to your friends, family, and neighbors about your experience. Notwithstanding the need for effective professional communications campaigns, there is no better EV messenger than a satisfied EV driver talking to those they know.

So spread the word because it’s not just about people buying EVs: consumers are also voters. The more who understand the ABCs of EVs, the more likely they are to vote for candidates who support ditching unaffordable internal combustion engines and getting America back on the path to affordable electric transportation.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-17 17:03:11.934643

The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.","SAN FRANCISCO(AP) — California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.

The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.

After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.

Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.

“Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,"" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

In a post on Musk's X service, Tesla brushed off the decision as regulatory overkill. “This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem. Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,” the company said.

The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world’s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.

Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, the fallout has continued to weigh on Tesla's auto sales, which had decreased by 9% from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.

Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration — a “somewhat successful” assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.

The performance of Tesla's stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk's efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the U.S.

Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.

California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.

Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/1e00faef-ab02-4675-ba5e-09ca248515a6/20251217T201013/1e00faef-ab02-4675-ba5e-09ca248515a6.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:05:08.782610

The rapid growth of AI data center demand makes meeting carbon-free targets extremely difficult, if not impossible. Climate goals are achievable only if demand is stifled, which would result in industry going abroad, as Europe is experiencing, leaving China to win the AI race.

Texas, as a red state with cheap land, relatively inexpensive energy, and a business-friendly tax and regulatory environment, is also attracting data center developers to the state. The expected demand is so large that many believe it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, according to CNBC. More than 220 gigawatts have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and more than 70% of those projects are data centers. That demand is more than twice the state’s peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. CNBC reports that ERCOT worries that speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize. State legislation in 2023 requires projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts.

Via CNBC, requests from large projects for connections to Texas’s electric grid have nearly quadrupled this year, highlighting the gap between speculative demand and what is likely to materialize. More than half of the proposed capacity — about 128 gigawatts — has not yet submitted the required studies for review by ERCOT. Another roughly 90 gigawatts is either under review or has received planning-study approval. By contrast, only about 7.5 gigawatts of projects have actually connected to the grid or secured full approval from ERCOT, a level of demand the state can readily accommodate. Texas could realistically supply 20 to 30 gigawatts of data-center demand by 2030, grid planners say, but not the far larger volumes implied by the speculative interconnection requests now on file.

Furthermore, CNBC reports that Texas is trying to reduce speculative requests for connections through a law passed in May that requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project, show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease, and disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. Fortunately for residents, the cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.

Analysis

Because data centers are expected to consume between 11% and 12% of total U.S. power demand by 2030, states are scrambling to find ways to mitigate this load without raising prices for consumers. As Virginia is realizing, climate mandates can’t coexist with a functioning digital economy because AI requires reliable generation to operate. Entrenched utilities will have a difficult time working through the regulatory process to build enough firm generation to meet growing demand. Therefore, policymakers should allow firms to bypass public utilities and build new, independent power infrastructure. As the Cato Institute’s Travis Fisher and Jennifer Huddleston argue, “If the United States wants to lead the world in AI, policymakers must abandon the illusion that a centrally planned grid can power a decentralized technological revolution. Energy abundance and technological progress thrive when they are built on the same foundation: an open-ended market process with less government intervention.”",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bigstock-High-Voltage-Work-78711299.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:01:22.240024

The letter comes as chemical industry lobbyists push Congress to reopen and roll back key public health protections added to TSCA in 2016, changes designed to fix decades of failure in the nation’s chemical safety system.

What’s happening

Since TSCA was updated in 2016, the chemical lobby has steadily worked to reopen the law and undo key reforms. Now, industry lobbyists see the current political environment as an opportunity to weaken this law.

EPA Administrator Zeldin has publicly stated that he wants EPA “to get out of the way” of industry. At the same time, chemical industry lobbyists have called for changes that would significantly limit EPA’s authority to fully review new chemicals before they enter the market. One industry demand is a return to a so-called “shot clock” approach, imposing rigid deadlines on EPA’s new chemical reviews, even when companies have failed to provide sufficient health and safety data.

These changes would dismantle the protections Congress put in place less than a decade ago and that have prevented harmful chemicals, including new PFAS, from entering the market.

Why it matters

Reopening TSCA is not about minor technical fixes. The chemical industry has made clear they want to roll back multiple provisions Congress passed in the bipartisan 2016 reforms, including safeguards that protect public health, the environment, and state authority.

At a January 2025 hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chemical industry lobbyists condemned the TSCA new chemicals program, which requires EPA to find that a chemical is safe before it enters the market. Industry groups claim this safeguard is “too burdensome.”

But Congress passed this safeguard for good reason.

Before the 2016 reforms, EPA routinely allowed chemical companies to introduce new chemicals into commerce with little to no health and safety data. Hundreds of PFAS and other dangerous chemicals entered the market under this broken system, leading to widespread pollution of our drinking water, air, and soil, and long-term exposures for millions of people.

Weakening TSCA now would repeat these same mistakes with serious consequences for public health.

Strong protections, fewer loopholes

The U.S. continues to see rising rates of chronic disease linked to chemical exposures. Thousands of chemicals can be found in our workplaces, homes, schools, and the environment, but only a small fraction have been independently studied or thoroughly assessed for their health and environmental impacts.

The most vulnerable among us—infants, children, pregnant women, workers, the elderly, and fenceline communities—are often the most exposed and the least protected.

We need stronger protections from toxic chemicals, not weaker.

The public supports strong protections from toxic chemicals

Efforts to weaken TSCA are out of step with public opinion. A recent poll found that 82% of voters favor TSCA, with strong bipartisan backing: 78% of Democrats, 81% of Independents, and 86% of Republicans. Protecting people from toxic chemicals is not a partisan issue, it’s a public health imperative.

What advocates are telling Congress

In the joint letter, organizations and groups urge lawmakers to stand firm against chemical lobby pressure:

“At a time when we must do more to protect our communities from chemical threats, we should not go backward. We urge that you stand strong against any weakening of TSCA and fight for an effective national program that delivers strong public health protections to all Americans.”

Take action

In addition to the joint sign-on letter, Toxic-Free Future activists and partners are urging members of Congress to reject chemical lobby efforts and defend TSCA’s public health protections.",https://toxicfreefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/TSCA-sign-on-letter-blog.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:01:00.815191

Energy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters Ford’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.
The grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China.
Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers.
Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.","Ford, a century after it launched the modern automotive era, has given up on its early ambitions to charge into the electrified future.

The company announced that it will delete nearly $20 billion in book value to extricate itself from its EV investments, an eye-popping loss that amounts to one of the biggest corporate impairments ever.

The company, of course, views it differently: The move is a ​“decisive redeployment of capital,” it said on Monday, as it rolled out a string of related strategic changes alongside the write-down.

The pivot hits particularly hard in the southeastern Battery Belt, where Ford had invested in multibillion-dollar BlueOval plants to produce batteries and electric vehicles. The EV battery facility in Glendale, Kentucky, will lay off about 1,600 employees, and local outlet the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported that a Ford factory in Tennessee will hire around 1,000 fewer workers than previously planned, now that it is making gas trucks instead of electric ones.

As Ford retreats from EVs, though, it’s enthusiastically embracing battery-making — announcing plans to repurpose the Kentucky plant to fuel its entrance into the grid storage market. It expects to spend roughly $2 billion over the next two years to launch production of lithium iron phosphate cells and package them into 20-foot containers that hold at least 5 megawatt-hours of storage capacity, equivalent to a Tesla Megapack. The plan is to ship at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

“This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford,” the company said in a statement. Ford also plans to make cells for home battery units at its factory in Marshall, Michigan.

Ford recently cut a deal with partner SK On, the South Korean battery maker, to dissolve their joint venture. Ford will keep the Kentucky battery plant while SK On takes the one at the sprawling BlueOval City complex near Memphis, Tennessee. That means batteries will still be made in that factory, just not exclusively for Ford products.

“They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at financial services firm Raymond James. ​“While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Ford’s sunny rhetoric about a ​“customer-driven shift” can’t hide the sheer enormity of the blow to its overall business.

As of Sept. 30, Ford’s accountants pegged its corporate value at more than $47 billion. Now Ford must lower that by $19.5 billion to reflect the dissolution of the joint venture agreement with SK On and the loss of planned EV models. The company will have to spend money to end production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, switch to producing a gas-and-battery-powered extended-range model, and retool factories for new, non-EV production.

The move comes as EVs account for just about 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S., far below the global figure of 25%. Though EV sales reach new records each year, the rate of growth has slowed, and there’s little reason to expect momentum to improve given recent federal policy changes.

“U.S. EV sales have never lived up to expectations,” said Molchanov. ​“That was true even while the tax credit was in place. Now, there’s no more tax credit, and EV sales have fallen off a proverbial cliff.”

The consumer EV tax credit ended in September as a result of the Republican budget law, taking away an incentive that helped lower or eliminate the premium for buying electric compared to a similar gas-powered model. Now, too, the average price of regular gasoline has dipped below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, while residential electricity prices rose 13% over the first three-quarters of this year, much faster than inflation.

“In terms of commodity prices, this is the worst of both worlds for EVs,” Molchanov said.

Energy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters

Ford’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.

It used to be that EVs were on the exponential growth curve, and stationary storage offered a modest side hustle for any leftover batteries. Now, between American automakers’ apparent inability to make affordable models and the Trump administration’s slashing and burning of federal EV incentives, that market is heading for some doldrums.

Grid battery providers, by contrast, are seeing business surge. Revenue from Tesla’s energy division, home to the Powerwall home battery and Megapack for large-scale storage, grew 67% last year compared to 2023, and broke $10 billion for the first time, even as the company’s market-leading EV business lost revenue.

Overall, the U.S. will install a record amount of battery capacity on the grid this year. Though analysts predict some dropoff over the next couple of years as the industry adapts to new federal anti-China rules, the utility-scale outlook through 2030 has actually increased 15% since the first half of this year, according to industry group American Clean Power.

Demand from AI data centers plays a massive role in that: Hyperscalers are realizing that strategically placed batteries can unlock capacity at critical constrained hours, in some cases letting the companies build computing hubs years earlier than they could if they waited for conventional grid upgrades. Ford, not coincidentally, will target data centers with its new battery products.

The grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China. But when President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, he preserved federal tax incentives for energy storage deployment while adding a new bureaucratic regime to make projects prove they don’t source parts from China in excess of newly set limits.

Starting in 2026, that will push storage developers to source U.S.-made batteries. There aren’t a lot of options today: LG, after making EV batteries in Michigan for years, began producing lithium iron phosphate cells there for grid use earlier this year. Tesla, Fluence, and others are following suit — in fact, the U.S. is on track for self-sufficiency in cell production for grid storage use by the end of 2026, according to the Energy Storage Coalition.

If project developers end up in a race to secure scarce domestic supply come 2027 or 2028, Ford could find eager buyers in spite of its short track record.

Still, that’s no guarantee of success. Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers. Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.

Put another way, Ford is copying Tesla’s strategy of leveraging EV prowess to sell grid storage, but doing so a decade later and without the EV prowess to lean on.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/04.01.25-KY-Plant-14.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=73c351b330ba4a22e35fbdf23cd8b3de,N,,2025-12-17 16:00:17.060412

In this last election, climate change was a defining issue in states like Virginia and Georgia, where voters grappled with rising energy costs. And no matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs—much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago—and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74% between 2008 and 2024—and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40% in the past two decades—meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes, and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island—site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history—to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution, and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources, and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills, and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100% renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access, and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

Sarah Nelson, assistant inspector general for the Energy Department's Office of Inspector General, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review ""whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are ""unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting ... intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

In Q3 2025, over 5.3 GW of energy storage was installed nationwide.
“Strong growth in the U.S. energy storage market reflects a simple reality: meeting rising demand and keeping the grid reliable increasingly requires storage,” said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis, ACP.
The residential energy storage market continues to make strides, installing 647 MW in Q3, marking the seventh consecutive growth quarter for the segment.
Community, commercial and industrial battery energy storage declined 8% year-on-year for Q3, installing 33 MW.","The US energy storage industry continues to mount impressive year-on-year growth, according to a quarterly report from Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

In Q3 2025, over 5.3 GW of energy storage was installed nationwide. Third-quarter installations increased 31% year-over-year. Q2 2025 remains the record quarter for deployments, with deployments decreasing in Q3 by 6% quarter-over-quarter.

Through three quarters, the industry has exceeded the total deployment of the full year 2024, said the report.

“Strong growth in the U.S. energy storage market reflects a simple reality: meeting rising demand and keeping the grid reliable increasingly requires storage,” said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis, ACP.

The utility-scale segment was the primary driver of capacity totals, with 4.6 GW of the 5.3 GW total carried by this segment, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Texas and California represented 82% of total utility-scale storage deployment.

The residential energy storage market continues to make strides, installing 647 MW in Q3, marking the seventh consecutive growth quarter for the segment. Residential energy storage deployments grew 70% year-over-year in Q3. Wood Mackenzie projects Q4 2025 will set a record for the residential sector as customers accelerate installations ahead of the Section 25D tax credit expiration. The residential segment’s shift toward third-party ownership models, which accounted for 57% of the market in Q3 2025, is helping to mitigate the impact of the Section 25D expiration, said the report.

Community, commercial and industrial battery energy storage declined 8% year-on-year for Q3, installing 33 MW. California represented 54% of installations in this segment. Wood Mackenzie said Illinois and Massachusetts have emerged as key markets for the segment. California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) 3.0, and Illinois’ rebate programs are expected to sustain steady deployment through 2029, said the report.

Wood Mackenzie increased its five-year forecast for utility-scale storage deployments by 15% compared to its projections released in the first half of 2025. It said that the market may plateau or even decline in 2026 and 2027.

“Although domestic battery manufacturing continues to ramp up to meet new tariffs and non-foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirements for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Wood Mackenzie projects near-term supply chain adjustments and constraints will drive an 11% contraction in the US utility-scale storage market in 2026 and an 8% decline in 2027,” said the report.

However, Wood Mackenzie expects strong recovery, with double-digit year-over-year growth in 2028 and 2029 as U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity comes online.

The firm forecasts nearly 93 GW of storage deployment across the U.S. in the next five years.

“Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_image004-1.png,N,,2025-12-17 19:04:21.043638

The joint venture was founded by eight carmakers (BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Toyota). Seven of them were present at the event, sharing their views on the entire project.

While the third part is dedicated more to hardcore EV charging enthusiasts, without flashy presentations, we noted a few interesting things.

The founding members of Ionna are EV manufacturers and competitors. However, they say the Ionna joint venture is a shared effort to address EV charging infrastructure challenges.

The companies agree that range anxiety is not as big an issue today as it was 10 or 15 years ago. There are already 300-mile EVs on the market. On the other hand, charging is a major barrier to growth in the EV segment.

The founding members agree that there is a gap between the EVs in North America and the available EV charging infrastructure. This specifically concerns DC fast chargers, but home charging has its issues, too, they believe.

The Ionna joint venture is intended to expand EV charging infrastructure, increasing the number of available chargers. We assume, although it was not said, that it’s important for other EV manufacturers to have a counterweight for the Tesla Supercharging network, which accounts for more than half of all DC fast-charging stalls in North America.

Ionna is expected to improve the situation quickly (“Ionna Speed”) and simultaneously enhance the overall user experience (reliability, amenities, Plug & Charge feature, high 400 kW power, and NACS connectors from day one).

A side element of the collaboration is the joint efforts and laboratories working to improve the reliability of charging by testing new models and developing software updates.

An interesting point is that, about two years ago, the founding members initially wanted to deploy CCS1 chargers exclusively. However, after adjusting the plan, the Ionna network launched with a 60% CCS1 / 40% NACS (SAE J3400) connector mix. In the future, the share of NACS chargers is expected to increase.

Ionna’s founding members are investing serious money into the company to install 30,000 DC fast-charging stalls by 2030. The financial aspects of the company’s plans were not discussed, although it was repeatedly stated that the goal is to make the network profitable at some point in the future.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251217-BASE-8-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:05:03.335604

Aggregating demand: Just as utility-scale solar and fleet EV purchases drove down costs, adaptation can benefit from collective purchasing.
Building an adaptation market starts with risk data Imagine a world where adaptation is fully integrated into economic and policy decisions.","At COP30, countries agreed within 10 years to triple support provided to developing nations for their adaptation priorities to increase resilience to climate change. This commitment comes at a critical moment. As progress to reduce planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels lags behind what scientists say is necessary, money is urgently needed to adapt to a warming world. And it’s worth the investment: every dollar spent on resilience yields ten times the return in avoided losses and economic benefits.

We need more decision-makers to understand this return on investment—and to do that, we need to build a market for adaptation solutions.

Climate impacts are accelerating faster than systems and societies can handle. This year alone, we witnessed 14 winter wildfires in Southern California and floods displacing millions from Texas to Nepal. At the same time, slow-onset impacts—like extreme heat, rising seas, and desertification—are reshaping cities, driving up food and energy costs, and threatening jobs and livelihoods. The adaptation gap and the affordability crisis are closely linked.

The reality is clear: climate change is already costing us. What we need now is a shift in mindset. Investing in adaptation today—proactively—will make our economies and communities safer and more prosperous well into the future.

Market roadblocks to adaptation

One reason adaptation lags behind is market failure. Traditionally, adaptation has relied almost entirely on public funding. While essential, public dollars alone won’t get us where we need to go. We must mobilize private capital and create market conditions that reward resilience.

Moreover, right now, markets don’t adequately price climate risks or value climate resilience. Risks remain invisible, resilience isn’t rewarded, and proven adaptation technologies and services fail to reach the people who need them most.

Taking a page from the clean energy playbook

The market challenges we face on adaptation are not new. In fact, we faced similar barriers when building clean energy markets. But today, renewable energy is often cheaper than fossil fuels because we created incentives, set standards, aggregated demand, and raised awareness. We can apply pages from this market-building playbook to drive access to and affordability of adaptation solutions.

Think about what drove clean energy adoption: electric vehicle mandates, Energy Star certification, LEED building standards, and tax incentives for solar. These tools spurred investment, scaled demand, and brought down costs. Adaptation needs its own version of these market drivers.

To make resilience visible, valuable, and investable—and do it at scale—will require shifting adaptation from primarily an emergency response to a more proactive, long-term economic strategy. Here’s what that looks like:

Creating incentives: Just as renewable energy tax credits and EV mandates boosted innovation and investor confidence, adaptation is following a similar path. For example, resilience bonds in cities like Miami link infrastructure upgrades to reduced insurance premiums, offsetting a portion of the cost of flood protection. Or look to policy mandates like those in Puerto Rico for community solar, which have catalyzed investment in energy systems that are both low-carbon and storm-resilient.

Aggregating demand: Just as utility-scale solar and fleet EV purchases drove down costs, adaptation can benefit from collective purchasing. If we can unite stakeholders to pool together investment in adaptation solutions and technologies, then we can drive demand up and price down. For example, EDF’s work with dairy entrepreneurs in India shows how coordinated adoption of climate-smart practices reduces costs and improves resilience. The 3-month program, launched in 2024, has now trained 120 rural entrepreneurs, with 130 more on deck, in dairy science, livestock rearing and business, with a focus on sustainable and climate-smart strategies that also improve bottom lines.

Setting standards: Energy Star and LEED transformed clean energy markets. Adaptation is beginning to benefit from similar benchmarks. The FORTIFIED Home™program certifies hurricane-resilient buildings, and states like Alabama, South Carolina and Florida offer homeowners incentives, grants and credits to make their homes safer with retrofits and materials that meet these standards. More broadly, we see an opportunity to align resilience metrics for infrastructure and supply chains with international frameworks to guide credible, risk-informed decisions.

Raising awareness: Just as clean energy campaigns highlight savings and benefits, adaptation needs compelling narratives. Research shows that adaptation investments can yield up to $10 for every $1 invested—but few communities are aware of this return on investment. The more we can arm decision-makers in communities, companies and government with information on risks, costs and returns on investment in resilience, the more we can work together to implement adaptation solutions that work.

Building an adaptation market starts with risk data

Imagine a world where adaptation is fully integrated into economic and policy decisions. The climate-resilient choice becomes the common sense, economically sensible choice. That means:

Building in ways that account for changing shorelines, wind speeds, and extreme heat.

Families accessing affordable tools to reduce wildfire and flood damage.

Businesses factoring climate risk into supply chain decisions.

To achieve this, we need to start with data: high-confidence, high-precision climate risk data for specific locations and industries. Then we pair it with economic modeling to understand the benefit-cost implications of adaptation options. This approach isn’t new, but what’s different now is the quality of data we have to act on. If companies, community and government decision makers can better understand the risk they face, the resilient choice can become the obvious and economically sensible choice.

To go beyond pledges and negotiations, governments, businesses and investors must work together to make resilience visible, valuable, and investable. True success means factoring in the real costs of climate impacts today, so we don’t just survive a changing climate—we protect lives, strengthen economies, and unlock opportunity. Because when we invest in resilience today, we secure a safer, more prosperous tomorrow.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//iStock-841448806.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:00:33.994389

The U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) on December 16 told TransAlta, a Calgary, Canada-based independent power producer (IPP), to keep the 730-MW, coal-fired Centralia Unit 2 online. DOE Secretary Chris Wright, as he and his agency have alleged in previous orders, said the region faces an energy emergency.

Officials in several states, along with power industry experts, have said no such emergency exists, although several agencies—including grid operators—have warned that increasing demand for electricity, including from artificial intelligence and data centers, threatens grid reliability.

It is not known how the DOE order could also affect TransAlta’s recently announced plan to switch the Centralia unit to burn natural gas. TransAlta on December 17 said the company is evaluating the DOE’s order. TransAlta on Wednesday said it would provide more information once available.

For more insight into how the Trump administration is using emergency orders in the energy sector, read “Federal Grid Interventions Enter a Second Phase as DOE Extends Emergency Orders,” published by POWER earlier this year.

“The shutdown of our last coal plant [in Washington] is two weeks away, and now the Trump administration has manufactured a fake emergency ordering TransAlta to keep burning coal against everyone’s wishes,” said Patti Goldman, an Earthjustice attorney, in a statement.

There is bipartisan support for keeping coal-fired power plants online. The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed legislation aimed at forcing utilities to keep coal-fired units operating beyond their scheduled retirement dates. The Republican-backed bill has support from some Democrats.

The “Power Plant Reliability Act,” H.R. 3632, is sponsored by Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.). The bill, which passed 222-202, would grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) new authority to require utilities to continue operating power plants if their closure would threaten reliability of the power grid.

“Nothing can be more destructive to our communities than a blackout,” said House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy Chair Bob Latta (R-Ohio). “When a state seeks to close a power plant without identifying sufficient replacement, there is little recourse for consumers.”

More Operational Orders on Tap

Tuesday’s order signed by Wright said closing the plant “could lead to the potential loss of power to homes, businesses, and facilities [in the region] critical to the national defense in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.” The DOE, citing Federal Power Act section 202(c), already has told coal-fired plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to remain online. Industry analysts have said at least five other coal-fired plants—all set to retire at the end of 2025—could also be ordered to remain in operation.

“The last administration’s energy subtraction policies had the United States on track to experience significantly more blackouts in the coming years—thankfully, President Trump won’t let that happen,” said Wright. “The Trump administration will continue taking action to keep America’s coal plants running so we can stop the price spikes and ensure we don’t lose critical generation sources. Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy to heat their homes all the time, regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”

Legal challenges to the DOE’s orders already are underway in federal court, with the cases centered on Consumer Energy’s coal-fired 1,420-MW J.H. Campbell power plant in West Olive, Michigan, and Constellation Energy’s two 380-MW gas- and oil-fired units at its Eddystone power plant near Philadelphia. The suits in part charge that the DOE has not shown any evidence of energy emergencies that would impact the plant’s service territories.

The grid operators for both Michigan and Pennsylvania— the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and the PJM Interconnection (PJM), respectively—had signed off on the closures, saying retirements of the power plants would not impact the reliability of the power supply in either region.

The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School earlier this year wrote that “Government research and independent assessments (from RMI, also known as the Rocky Mountain Institute and Energy Innovation) contradict President Trump’s findings about insufficient energy supply and grid unreliability.” The group also noted, “There are, of course, legitimate grid reliability challenges to tackle, such as those brought on by increased extreme weather events caused by climate change. But evidence suggests that current energy supply and price conditions simply do not constitute a national emergency.”

The DOE’s emergency order for Centralia noted, “The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) determined in its 2025-2026 Winter Reliability Assessment that the WECC Northwest region is at elevated risk during periods of extreme weather, such as prolonged, far-reaching cold snaps.”

90-Day Order

Wright in issuing a 90-day emergency order ordered the Centralia unit to remain running until March 16, 2026. Wright said the plant should operate under the auspices of either the Bonneville Power Administration—in its role as a balancing authority in the Pacific Northwest— or the California Independent System Operator, which is the reliability coordinator for the region.

Washington legislators passed a state law ordering the Centralia plant to retire, and Unit 1 at the site was retired by TransAlta in 2020. The state’s Clean Energy Transformation Act bans the use of coal to produce electricity starting in 2026; Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said the order issued Tuesday would violate that law.

TransAlta’s financial filings show the IPP has sold the power produced at Centralia on a merchant basis and through long-term contracts.

Opponents of keeping U.S. coal-fired plants operating past their scheduled retirements have said the cost of continuing operations will fall on ratepayers. Consumers Energy in an October filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote that the costs of complying with the order for the Campbell plant—which was scheduled to close in May—had reached $80 million through the end of September. The utility said the cost of operating the plant was being paid by ratepayers in Michigan and 10 other states.

Earthjustice and other advocacy groups have said the emergency orders amount to a “power grab” by the Trump administration. The groups have argued that forcing what they call “unreliable and uneconomic” power plants to stay online will lead to higher bills for ratepayers, and will threaten the health of those in communities served by the facilities.

Wright told TransAlta to propose tariff revisions, or seek waivers with FERC, “as needed” to pay for operations at Centralia. Wright said rate recovery is available through the federal regulation governing energy emergencies.

Officials have said that with regard to the plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Consumers Energy and Constellation will be paid via charges imposed by MISO and PJM on the loads on their systems. Officials said that’s because the emergency orders for the Campbell and Eddystone plants were directed to MISO and PJM, not the power plant owners. Consumers Energy in its October SEC filing said its costs to continue operating the Campbell facility totaled $164 million from May through September, but said it was able to offset a portion of those costs through $84 million of revenue it earned from selling power to the MISO system.

TransAlta earlier this month announced it had agreed to sell Puget Sound Energy electricity, capacity. and ancillary services across a 15-year period starting late in 2028, after the Centralia plant was converted to burn natural gas. TransAlta had said it expected to make a final investment decision on the project after receiving needed regulatory approvals from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, which are expected in 2027.

Other coal-fired units that had been scheduled to close by year-end include:

The 590-MW Big Cajun II Unit 3 in Louisiana (part owned by Entergy).

The 90-MW F.B. Culley 2 in Indiana (CenterPoint Energy).

The 772-MW R.M. Schahfer power station in Indiana (Northern Indiana Public Service Co.).

The 335-MW Comanche 2 in Colorado (Public Service Co. of Colorado/Xcel Energy).

The 427-MW Craig 1 in Colorado (jointly owned by PacifiCorp, Platte River Power Authority, Salt River Project, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, and Public Service Co. of Colorado/Xcel Energy).

Merrillville, Indiana-based Northern Indiana Public Service Co., known as NIPSCO, already has filed plans to build a 2.3-GW natural gas-fired power plant at the Schahfer site in Wheatfield. The utility, which earlier said it would build a gas-fired peaker plant at the location, has said new generation is needed to support potential load growth from data centers.

Xcel Energy in November filed a petition with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to extend operations at its 50-year-old Comanche 2 unit in Pueblo for an additional year. The agency approved the petition earlier this month. The utility has said the generation from Unit 2 is needed because the 750-MW Unit 3 at the site—scheduled for closure in 2031—has been offline since mid-summer due to “notable damage,” and is not expected to return to service for several months.

The Craig 1 unit in northwest Colorado also is expected to continue to operate. Mark Stutz, a Tri-State spokesperson, earlier this month told POWER that the utility “expects to receive an order before the end of the year” to keep the Craig unit operational. Stutz said Tri-State is following the court cases filed around the earlier emergency orders.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/centralia-power-plant-september-2020-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:01:47.407526

The bill would boost clean, American manufacturing and cut industrial pollution in the United States and abroad.

The bill would encourage American manufacturers to reduce emissions, and protect those that do, by placing a fee on the worst polluters in carbon-intensive sectors like fossil fuels, aluminum, steel, and cement. The fee, which would also apply to imports, ensures that global bad actors do not undercut innovative American producers that have invested in lowering pollution.

Revenue from the polluter fee would be reinvested into domestic industrial decarbonization projects so that companies with high-emitting facilities have the opportunity to upgrade and meet standards. Additional revenue would be set aside to support clean industry and the transition away from carbon-intensive manufacturing practices globally, which would ensure a level playing field for American manufacturers. Crucially, it would expand the global market for low-carbon goods made with processes successfully deployed in the United States and amongst trade partners.

As a result, the Clean Competition Act of 2025 clears a path to decarbonize US industry by 2050 and improves the marketability of US industry’s products.

In response, Sierra Club Industrial Transformation Campaign Lead Harry Manin issued the following statement:

“The Trump administration only pays lip service to American manufacturing, while giving a pass to pollution-cheats and raising prices on consumers. The Clean Competition Act takes the opposite approach of Trump’s handouts to polluters by rewarding companies who do the right thing and those who want to invest in innovation and promote health and efficiency. It seeks to level the global playing field by raising standards around the world, instead of exacerbating a race to the bottom that increases pollution and decreases wages. We are grateful for Sen. Whitehouse and Rep. DelBene’s leadership and urge all champions of American manufacturing, clean air, and a livable climate to support the bill.”

When it comes to looking ahead to 2026, what do you think will be a defining area of interest that will or should take up the news cycle when it comes to energy, environmental, and climate news?","I don’t think I’m alone when I say this past year’s news cycle has felt like a crashing wave. At times, it felt relentless: enough to take your breath away. Many of us knew that 2025 was going to be a ride since we’ve lived through this before. We just didn’t know how much of it we’d see again—and at what cadence.

It turns out the answer was a rapid-fire one. Project 2025 primed President Trump to come back into the Oval Office with no hesitation about his game plan. He issued 26 executive orders on his first day, quickly established himself as a pro–fossil fuel president, handed Elon Musk the tools needed to strip key science agencies of their staff, and began chipping away at environmental initiatives started under Obama and strengthened by Biden. He pushed Congress to largely defang Biden’s capstone Inflation Reduction Act and followed that up with the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which didn’t extend tax credits for electric vehicles and placed new restrictions on energy tax credits.

Looking back at what transpired on a policy level last year is rather astounding—but that’s just part of the story. As readers of The Understory know, it’s important to view this past year from all angles.

With this final newsletter of 2025, I wanted to take stock of what occurred over the past year by first looking at details that might have been lost in the headlines—or that only make sense in retrospect. I wanted to assess how much the White House really did, how many changes we saw, and how those shifts affected our lived experiences. Some of the numbers might surprise you.

From a climate perspective, there were major policy blows and setbacks when it came to slowing emissions and protecting the planet in the face of global warming.

Let’s start with the hard facts. In 2025, there were:

221 executive orders signed by the White House, 20 of which pertained specifically to energy or climate

1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters proposed to be opened to offshore drilling for the first time

A 27% decrease in electric vehicle sales from January to November

A 1.1% rise in global emissions, a record high

Just a 2-cent decrease in the national average price of gas from January to November

Q: Looking back on 2025, what do you think was the top upset for you when it comes to climate change, energy, or the environment? Something that you felt at the time, and perhaps still feel now, was incredibly jarring?

“The big one is the absolute passivity of Congress in the face of all this. The environmental movement of the 1970s was embodied in the legislation adopted in the period between 1970 and 1990. At that time, Congress focused in great detail on the environmental challenges facing the country. Now, as we face new challenges, Congress is nowhere to be found except in partisan sound bites untethered to facts, and has abdicated its oversight role … The current situation is unlike anything I ever saw in my 39 years with EPA.” –Stan Meiburg, former acting EPA administrator under Obama

“The previous administration had put us on a hopeful path to combat climate change with the Inflation Reduction Act. The illegal termination of grant programs, like the $7 billion Solar For All program, has profound implications for climate change, as well as deeply harmful impacts to communities all over the United States.” -Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center

“For too many, 2025 was a year of great sadness, fear, and loss. As a D.C. resident and a proud former federal employee, the dismantling of federal agencies and protections has been deeply concerning—specifically, how openly the Trump administration has stepped away from its basic responsibility to serve the people. Almost overnight, critical programs have been gutted, experts sidelined, and enforcement tools weakened without regard for the impacts.” -Corey Solow, legislative director for climate and energy at Earthjustice

“The first six months of the year were the costliest six months of weather disasters in U.S. history. More pollution’s only going to make those disasters more destructive, drive up insurance costs, and threaten home values.” -Joanna Slaney, vice president, political affairs and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund

“In August, the Trump Administration announced NASA would decommission satellites that are collecting climate and pollution data, despite the fact that they have already been paid for, and that operating costs were low. The Trump Administration is choosing to *pay* to stop having information. That, among other things, is a sign that this administration is not only governing by medieval ideology, but aiming to destroy any competing forms of knowledge. When a government recognizes data and information as its enemy, it has entered dystopia.” -Shi-Ling Hsu, environmental law professor at Florida State University College of Law

“What’s incredibly jarring to me has been the use of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to criminally investigate current and former EPA employees working on climate change programs. These mafioso-like tactics are part of a well-planned effort by the administration to intimidate public employees and create false narratives around programs that they use to destroy.” -Tim Whitehouse, executive director for the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility

Q: Considering that same time period, what is something that happened, or you’ve experienced or heard, that gives you hope?

“I have been encouraged by the resilience of some states, local groups, and communities, especially in the area of renewable energy. Despite massive propaganda efforts by the administration, both communities and businesses continue to discover that renewable energy, such as combinations of solar power and battery storage, are cheaper and faster to build and use than fossil fuel alternatives … Doing the right thing for the environment is being reframed, as it should, as also doing the right thing for our wallets—making health care and energy more affordable while improving our quality of life.” –Stan Meiburg, former acting EPA administrator under Obama

“Earthjustice and our partners are appearing before state public utility commissions to push back on utility plans to continue relying on aging coal plants to produce electricity. In Kentucky, we successfully argued before the Public Service Commission to require the utility to consider retiring coal plants and develop plans to implement energy efficiency and demand response programs. Meanwhile, our Right to Zero campaign is driving city, state, and regional action to electrify our transportation, homes, buildings, and industries and build a zero-emissions future for all.” -Corey Solow, legislative director for climate and energy at Earthjustice

“The elections in November were a referendum on energy prices—and people voted enthusiastically for candidates who said they were going to do something about it, and that included more clean, reliable, affordable energy. The results are clear: people want more choices. They want lower prices. That’s not what they’ve been getting.” –Joanna Slaney, vice president, political affairs and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund

“About five years ago, I realized that the same question was rising to the top of the questions I was receiving at nearly every talk I was giving, whether to high school students or architects: ‘What gives you hope?’ (or sometimes the flip side, ‘Are we screwed?’) … Hope itself is not an emotion: It is a choice, a practice, and a conviction that what we do will make a difference. In a nutshell, it’s action! Not only our own, but being aware of and sharing that of others… We are long past the time when we need to search for hope. Instead, the right question to ask is: “What are you doing to create hope?” Share your actions with others and learn and share about theirs, too. That is how we create hope together.” –Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy

Q. When it comes to looking ahead to 2026, what do you think will be a defining area of interest that will or should take up the news cycle when it comes to energy, environmental, and climate news?

“The explosion of AI has generated plenty of headlines, but the impacts of unchecked data-center expansion on public health and the environment must be at the forefront of the conversation. These massive data centers often consume as much energy as an entire city. The Trump administration is using projected AI energy demand as an excuse to prop up coal and gas plants, increasing pollution and delaying our transition to clean energy while leaving communities footing the bill through higher electricity rates.” -Corey Solow, legislative director for climate and energy at Earthjustice

“There is no question that climate-fueled disasters are on the rise: from disastrous wildfires across North America to unprecedented cyclones and typhoons in southeast Asia…Sadly, so too will [increase] the misinformation and disinformation that surround them, hampering the accurate communication of facts and efforts to assist with risk mitigation and recovery: an issue which is also at the very top of the World Economic Forum’s risks list! These risks are no longer distant; they are literally affecting the air we breathe, the cost of the food we eat, the quality of the water we drink, and even the expenses of the homes we maintain.” –Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy

“What I am looking for in 2026 are signs that China will be exporting its solar panels to less-developed countries, and that China might undertake leadership on emissions reductions, perhaps working more closely with the EU. That remains a pretty speculative possibility, but since Europe now finds itself utterly alone, there may be scope for a bargain with the only remaining rational (if still authoritarian and evil) superpower.” –Shi-Ling Hsu, environmental law professor at Florida State University College of Law

“The wheels are coming off the bus, so to speak—the bus being the administration. This means this coming year will be even more dangerous for this country than the past year. It will be important that those who report the news not overlook the important energy, environmental, and climate trends and issues that we need to address as a country in the midst of what will be a chaotic and difficult year politically.” -Tim Whitehouse, executive director for the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility

“Insight will come from the Court’s decisions about the ability of the executive branch to rescind or ‘claw back’ funds appropriated to Congress, especially for renewable energy and disadvantaged communities. Given that the administration seems to have abdicated its role in environmental enforcement, courts are also likely to see more citizen suit cases whose outcomes will be worth watching.” –Stan Meiburg, former acting EPA administrator under Obama

“I think we will start to get some clarity on where grantees can get relief for the illegal termination of their grants. As these cases start to reach final judgment, we could hope to see a big influx of funding back into programs to combat climate change.” -Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/climate-year-globe-hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 15:00:10.297186

Teschendorf (Germany) - Energiequelle GmbH has officially commissioned a new wind farm in Teschendorf, Lower Saxony, featuring five Enercon turbines of the E 138 type. Each turbine has a capacity of 4.2 megawatts, resulting in a total wind farm capacity of 21 MW.

Energiequelle expects the wind farm to generate an annual energy yield of around 60 million kilowatt-hours. This could supply approximately 17,000 households with CO₂-free electricity.

According to Energiequelle, the project’s implementation was lengthy: the regional planning phase took ten years, followed by a two-year zoning procedure. Construction work began in June 2024, and the project was completed as planned in October 2025.

In addition to contributing to the energy transition, the wind farm provides financial benefits for the region. A total of around three million euros will flow to the city of Wittingen and the surrounding districts of Teschendorf, Küstorf, Schneflingen, and Mahnburg. Of this, around 120,000 euros per year go to the municipality under § 6 of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG), while the Energiequelle Foundation provides an additional 15,000 euros per year. Furthermore, a 200-euro electricity bonus per household is granted to registered local residents over ten years – for approximately 180 households, this amounts to around 360,000 euros.

The Teschendorf wind farm serves as an example of successful acceptance work: transparent information and direct financial participation of residents are seen as key factors for local support of wind energy projects. Project manager Tina Hermerding also emphasizes the importance of involving the community: “In order to create acceptance for projects in the field of renewable energies, it is important to involve people and the community financially.”

On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) proposed a revised definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (Proposed Rule). The Trump administration announced that the Proposed Rule would “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.”

The new definition is expected to reduce the number of streams and wetlands that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and will impact several federal regulatory programs, including Section 404 permitting of impacts to regulated waters. The agencies drafted the Proposed Rule to closely mirror the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which held that the Clean Water Act extends to “relatively permanent” bodies of water connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to those waters.

The Proposed Rule adds definitions for several terms, including “relatively permanent,” “tributary,” “continuous surface connection,” “prior converted cropland,” and “ditch.”

The public comment period will begin when the Proposed Rule is published in the Federal Register. If finalized, it will replace the Biden administration’s 2023 definition of WOTUS. The definition of WOTUS has changed several times in the last decade. Each new definition has been challenged in the courts.

Bryan Hanson, chief generation officer of nuclear juggernaut Constellation Energy, told WGN News of Constellation's Byron location, ""If you add it up, over 2 million homes get their electricity just from this single plant.""

Nuclear power is one of many viable alternatives to dirty fuels. Unlike solar and wind, nuclear does not rely on unpredictable weather to work. Plus, nuclear power plants don't pollute the atmosphere. In fact, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, over 430 million tons of carbon dioxide were not released into the atmosphere in 2023, thanks to the use of nuclear energy.

However, there are downsides.

One of the many common misconceptions about nuclear energy is that it's renewable. Unfortunately, it's not. While its lack of air pollution gives it a leg up on dirty fuels, most nuclear power plants require uranium, a non-renewable resource, to make energy.

Uranium's radioactivity also poses a health risk. The mining process leaves behind radioactive waste, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has contaminated groundwater at former mining sites.

The reasons behind nuclear power aren't exactly environmentally friendly, either. As AI grows, so does the demand for power. Gil Quiniones, ComEd CEO, told WGN, ""The surge in load growth in certain regions of our country is because of AI and AI data centers. We've never seen this kind of growth.""

While nuclear-powered AI is a better alternative to data centers powered by dirty fuels, it still consumes a non-renewable resource at a rapid rate. According to the MIT Technology Review, the carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers is 48% higher than the U.S. average.

Even though their energy consumption is higher than average, these data centers often leave average American families to foot the bill.

So, while nuclear is the better option, there's still work to be done. Thankfully, there are researchers out there who are committed to doing it. For example, a government lab in Tennessee is 3D printing building materials for nuclear power plants, cutting down on construction costs and resources.

Yes, nuclear energy's reputation is complicated. Still, one thing is clear: Illinois is undoubtedly at the forefront of this shifting energy landscape.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Rj0q1wLuARYUSz49_wbU2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/afc307be19d3ad7f8048c7624cb69f07,N,,2025-12-17 17:03:59.742360

With FY2026 Budget on the Line, Former EPA Leaders Urge Congress to Advance Senate’s Bipartisan Bill to Halt the Dismantling of Protections to Americans’ Health

“Congress now has the first real opportunity to put some checks on this serial shutdown and to reaffirm that Americans still expect EPA to do its job.”

Washington D.C. – Former EPA leaders and policy experts from the Environmental Protection Network today urged Congress to reject deep House-proposed cuts to EPA’s budget and instead adopt the bipartisan Senate FY2026 appropriations bill, which preserves core health, safety, science, and clean water protections.

In a press briefing at the close of what speakers described as “a year of serial shutdown inside EPA,” EPN experts pointed to the deliberate pattern of weakened protections, sidelined science, and staff attrition has left Americans more exposed to toxic chemicals and environmental hazards.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

EPA’s Ability to Protect Americans is Being Dismantled

Marc Boom, EPN Senior Director of Public Affairs, opened the briefing with a clear warning: “For nearly a year, political appointees have taken step after step that add up to a serial shutdown of EPA’s ability to protect people’s health. The result is simple: more unsafe air, more contaminated water, and fewer safeguards when pollution or industrial accidents occur.”

Boom outlined multiple actions taken in the past 11 months, including proposals to weaken PFAS protections, delays on toxic wastewater standards, weakened mercury pollution rules, and plans to eliminate EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD).

He emphasized the real-world impacts: higher cancer risks, more lead exposure, greater PFAS contamination, and longer delays in identifying hazardous chemicals.

House vs. Senate: A Clear Choice for Congress

EPN experts stressed that with the federal funding deadline approaching, lawmakers face a consequential decision:

The House Bill: Deep Cuts that Endanger Communities

23% cut to EPA’s budget

Major cuts to enforcement—limiting the agency’s ability to hold polluters accountable

Slashing science funding and enabling plans to close ORD

Cutting millions from clean water revolving funds, jeopardizing states’ ability to address lead pipes, PFAS, and failing water systems

“These cuts translate directly into harm: Slower cleanups, fewer inspections, and higher risks for families,” said Boom.

The Senate Bill: A Bipartisan Plan that Preserves Core Protections

5% cut to EPA’s FY25 budget

Blocks closure of ORD, with Senate appropriators calling that proposal “appalling” and posing “immeasurable risk”

Maintains state clean water revolving funds

Passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 26–2

“Passing the Senate bill would send a powerful message that Americans want real guardians on the job protecting their health and safety,” Boom said.

States Will Feel the Cuts First—and Hardest

David Coursen, former EPA attorney, highlighted that EPA’s budget is also state funding: “States depend on EPA and federal money for a substantial part of their core budget, so they really need this money to operate.”

Coursen and others noted significant cuts in the House bill to state revolving funds that provide money to states that help municipal water systems provide safe drinking water.

Budget cuts in the House bill would mean:

More brown water at the tap

More stormwater contamination

More illness

Higher water bills for families who can least afford it.

Science on the Chopping Block: ORD and the Health Risks

Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former Acting Assistant Administrator for ORD, detailed the danger in eliminating EPA’s scientific backbone: “Dismantling EPA’s Office of Research and Development would devastate the agency’s ability to protect us from legacy pollution, emerging threats. … Guarding against chemicals like PFAS, lead, and wildfire smoke and other harms really depends on sound policy, sound enforcement that’s built around the foundation of sound science.”

She emphasized ORD’s essential role in:

Chemical risk assessments

Disaster response

Supporting states and Tribal Nations with actionable science

Without ORD, Orme-Zavaleta said, “America will no longer have the benefit of the world’s premier environmental health research organization to help us understand the impacts of toxic pollution and other environmental threats.”

ADDITIONAL KEY QUOTES

Marc Boom, former EPA Senior Advisor on policy and EPN Senior Advisor

“We’re here today because Congress now has the first real opportunity to put some checks on this serial shutdown and to reaffirm that Americans still expect EPA to do its job.”

“This is a moment of choice for Congress. Passing the Senate approach would send a clear message that the serial shutdown of the EPA must be reined in, that congressional intent must be followed, that Americans still expect guardians on the job protecting their health and safety.”

“The bill reported out of the House Appropriations Committee … would cut EPA’s budget still by a very large 23%. And that would mean slash enforcement funding, deep cuts to science, a reduction of $1.7 billion, or more than 60%, in what’s available through the state revolving funds for communities that rely on those to keep their drinking water safe.”

David Coursen, former attorney in EPA’s Office of General Counsel

“This is a lot more than just talking about taking money away from EPA. It’s taking money from the whole regulatory structure, superstructure. And so it’s important to bear that in mind and recognize that states are going to lose a lot of money here. There are grants that go to states and federal assistance that goes to states and logistical support and state revolving (funds that go) to the states.”

Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former Acting Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of Research and Development

“Congress has the chance right now to put up a giant stop sign. Adopting the Senate proposal is the clearest way to protect Americans’ health and safety.”

“EPA’s first administrator had three guiding principles for the agency, which has been followed for most of the agency’s 55 years of existence, which is to follow the science, follow the law, and be transparent. Science is really foundational to EPA in its ability to achieve its mission, and now it’s at risk.”

EPN has commended the Senate for taking a bipartisan approach to the FY 2026 budget and opposed the massive, partisan cuts to EPA proposed by President Trump (a 55% cut) and by the House.

Their importance to the U.S. economy and national security propelled passage of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which allocated more than $10 billion to support research and development initiatives.

On Jan. 3, the Commerce Department finalized its SMART USA award, one of many CHIPS contracts the outgoing Biden administration signed in the weeks before Trump’s inauguration. The institute opened at SRC’s campus to the east of RTP.

Digital twinning aims to save time and money by allowing researchers to pinpoint and patch production inefficiencies in a virtual space. It also facilitates greater information sharing between partners, said Laurie Locascio, then-undersecretary of commerce for standards and technology, during an event announcing SMART USA in November 2024.

U.S. Commerce steers CHIPS toward ‘venture-capital’ mindset

Under Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has sought to bring “a more venture capital-style approach” to the CHIPS Research and Development Office, informing recipients the federal government may seek equity, royalties or revenue sharing as a condition of awards. In August, the Department reversed Biden’s policy to create a nonprofit called Natcast to operate a $7.4 billion national hub for semiconductor research, choosing instead to administer these CHIPS funds itself.

“The Department of Commerce has opted to terminate its award to the SMART USA Institute, as the Administration’s vision for the CHIPS Research and Development program has been refocused to advance the President’s stated agenda of securing the U.S.’s position as the unrivaled world leader in critical and emerging technologies,” a spokesperson for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which oversees the R&D program, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.

Semicondcutor Research Corp. met all performance benchmarks under its contract, SRC spokesperson Paris Stringfellow said. SMART USA has 121 members, she noted in an email to The N&O, and the future of the nascent institute is unclear. University and private sector funding announced alongside the CHIPS award gave SMART USA more than $1 billion to operate.

SRC says the government told them of the termination on Dec. 10 The Triangle Business Journal first reported on the award ending Monday.

Stringfellow declined to share whether SRC received any money through its now-cancelled award but said the nonprofit had finished the initial phase of its contract. She also said SRC’s longer-running semiconductor research projects remain active.

SMART USA is one of 18 Manufacturing USA institutes, a nationwide group of public-private centers designed to advance domestic manufacturing. SRC said it is unaware of others in this network losing federal funding.

The remaining 10 percent would have to be offset through the use of low-carbon EU steel, e-fuels or biofuels.
In a statement, the Commission insisted the plans were consistent with the EU's 2050 climate targets but take a ""pragmatic"" approach.
German environment minister Carsten Schneider said the proposal gives automakers ""greater leeway to manage the transition to the electric future.""
Martin Kaiser, head of Greenpeace Germany, said the EU is gifting Chinese electric carmakers an ""early Christmas present"" and ""sacrificing Europe's climate goals.""","German chancellor Friedrich Merz and European carmakers welcomed proposed changes to the European Union's post-2035 rules on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars, backing what they described as a more flexible, technology-neutral approach to cutting emissions.

""More openness to technology and more flexibility are the right steps to take so as to better align climate targets, market realities, businesses and jobs,"" said Merz, adding that regulations shouldn't lead to ""more bureaucracy"".

The new proposal, which still needs approval from EU member states and the European Parliament, would replace the 2035 deadline to register new combustion engines with a requirement to cut tailpipe emissions by 90 percent. The remaining 10 percent would have to be offset through the use of low-carbon EU steel, e-fuels or biofuels. It also includes incentives aimed at boosting the bloc's battery industry.

The European Commission proposal follows intense lobbying from countries like Germany and Italy as well as many of the continent's automakers, forcing the proposed changes against a backdrop of sluggish car sales, growing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles and a trade war with the United States.

In a statement, the Commission insisted the plans were consistent with the EU's 2050 climate targets but take a ""pragmatic"" approach. Moving away from a de-facto ban would allow plug-in hybrids, range extenders and internal combustion engine vehicles to play a role beyond 2035, alongside battery-electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Other ""key flexibilities"" include lowering the 2030 CO2 reduction target for vans to 40 percent from 50 percent, introducing super credits for small, affordable electric cars and setting mandatory national targets for zero- or low-emission corporate fleets. The targets would be tailored to each member state, with national authorities choosing how best to meet them.

German environment minister Carsten Schneider said the proposal gives automakers ""greater leeway to manage the transition to the electric future."" Germany's car industry association VDA criticised the proposal as ""disappointing"" and ""fatal,"" saying it would ""impose new requirements on the auto industry — for example on the use of green steel or renewable fuels."" Such requirements were beyond the industry's control and could leave manufacturers exposed to penalties if expectations were not met, said VDA president Hildegard Müller.

Martin Kaiser, head of Greenpeace Germany, said the EU is gifting Chinese electric carmakers an ""early Christmas present"" and ""sacrificing Europe's climate goals.""

Transport is the EU's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The sector's emissions have fallen only slightly since 2005. The Commission's proposals ""are expected to slow the momentum of Europe's EV market at a time when global car electrification is accelerating,"" the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said in a statement. But it added that proposals on corporate fleet regulations are a silver lining and could help speed up the adoption of zero-emission cars and vans, ""increasing their future availability in the second-hand market.""",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-17 14:59:41.044954

Ford notified LG of the canceled order on Wednesday, the South Korean company said in a regulatory filing in Seoul. The amount is equivalent more than a third of LG’s total revenue last year.

LG is the latest casualty of Ford’s retrenchment in EVs — the carmaker recently said it would take $19.5 billion in charges tied to the business and that it would scrap plans to make an electric F-Series truck. The company is also breaking up its U.S. battery venture with Korea’s SK Innovation Co.

Ford’s announcement this week kicked off a cascade of signals that the EV era is entering a more uncertain, more contested phase. The European Commission backed away from what had been the world’s most aggressive timeline for phasing out internal-combustion engines, granting manufacturers and consumers more time to move off gasoline.

Those who took early resignation but were not eligible to retire were paid until the end of September.

In an email, EPA spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said the “vast majority of those employees on administrative leave” took the deferred resignation option.

“We are doing more with less and remain confident EPA has the resources needed to accomplish the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, fulfill all statutory obligations, and make the best-informed decisions based on the gold standard of science,” Hirsch said. “EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer resources and will be better able to deliver on its core mission of protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback.”

Other EPA employees received reduction-in-force notices and were placed on leave beginning in February because the agency determined their roles no longer aligned with the agency’s goals, including work associated with environmental justice, and diversity, equity and inclusion.

During an event for reporters last week, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency started with more than 16,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration’s return to office and would end with about 12,500 by the end of the year.

But former employees, advocates and attorneys said the leaves and the subsequent terminations could harm the public and environmental health.

Longtime staffers who signed the letter said in interviews that they feared the agency’s long-standing approach to protecting human health and the environment “would be reversed,” according to Ted Yackulic, a former attorney and adviser who litigated for the cleanup of Superfund sites in EPA’s Region 10. Yackulic, who had helped negotiate cleanup for more than 30 high priority polluted sites across 36 years, was nearing a settlement for a waterway that was inundated with heavy metals and hazardous substances in Seattle when he was placed on administrative leave in July for signing the dissent letter.

Yackulic, one of six former employees who have appealed their terminations, said that the loss of several attorneys has meant that “the cleanup of contaminated properties may be significantly delayed.”

But Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who directs the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said that given the Trump administration’s push to boost fossil fuel production and lower energy costs, “some people at EPA are not needed.”",,N,,2025-12-17 15:00:14.724965

The project, “Made in America? Unpacking the Drivers and Impacts of Domestic Clean Energy Manufacturing,” brings together a national, interdisciplinary team to study how federal and state policies are reshaping clean-energy investments, supply chains, job creation, and long-term decarbonization pathways in the United States.

Professor He, a faculty member in Baruch College’s Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, and also with CUNY Graduate Center and CUNY Institute for Demographic Research, will serve as Lead Principal Investigator. Co-PIs include researchers Dr. Kaifang Luo, postdoctoral researcher at Baruch College, Associate Professor Michael Davidson from the University of California San Diego, Associate Professor Ahmad Lashkaripour from Indiana University, Assistant Professor Minghao Qiu from Stony Brook University, and Dr. Ilaria Mazzocco from Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

Strengthening the Nation’s Clean-Energy Manufacturing

The research team will analyze the economic, employment, environmental, and climate implications of emerging domestic manufacturing hubs and clusters and identify evidence-based strategies to strengthen U.S.’s clean-energy manufacturing.

The project will collaborate with experts from the University of Maryland Center for Global Sustainability, New York Climate Exchange, University of California Berkeley, University of Dayton, and Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, with additional partners for local implementation and policy impact.

Combining empirical analysis, energy-systems modeling, and case studies, the project will evaluate the effectiveness of federal and state manufacturing incentives, examine spatial patterns of clean-energy investments, map supply-chain shifts, estimate impact on clean energy jobs, assess impacts on emissions and climate effects, and organize a stakeholder workshop to gain insights on strengthening domestic clean energy manufacturing.

The project will also create research and training opportunities for Baruch College students through the Deep Energy and Climate Policy Lab.

Interdisciplinary and Cross Institutional Research Team

The research team includes experts in industrial policy, trade economics, energy systems, sustainability, and international supply chains. Each co-PI highlights the project’s unique contributions:

Gang He, Baruch College

“This generous support from the Sloan Foundation enables us to take a rigorous, data-driven look at one of the most consequential industrial transformations underway in the United States. Understanding how domestic clean-energy manufacturing evolves, and who benefits, is essential for designing policies that support workers, communities, and a competitive low-carbon economy.”

Kaifang Luo, Baruch College

“By coupling integrated assessment modeling with supply-chain analysis, we can better understand the technology evolution, cost trajectory, and decarbonization pathways associated with different combinations of industrial policies.”

Michael Davidson, University of California San Diego

“Federal incentives are reshaping the geography of clean-energy manufacturing at a scale we haven’t seen in decades. This project will help identify which policy strategies create durable industrial ecosystems, and which may struggle to take root.”

Ahmad Lashkaripour, Indiana University

“Domestic manufacturing is deeply intertwined with global trade dynamics. By examining how U.S. policies interact with international supply chains, our work will shed light on trade implications that are critical for long-term competitiveness and economic resilience.”

Minghao Qiu, Stony Brook University

“Clean-energy supply chains have profound consequences for environmental sustainability and climate mitigation. Our analysis will quantify how different manufacturing pathways affect emissions, air quality, and broader environmental outcomes, insights that are essential for guiding responsible industrial transformation.”

Ilaria Mazzocco, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)

“Effective industrial strategy requires more than data—it requires dialogue. This project will bring policymakers, industry leaders, and community stakeholders together through workshop and collaborative engagement to ensure that our research directly informs real-world decisions.”

High-impact Research and Collaboration

“This project reflects Baruch’s commitment to research that addresses society’s most pressing challenges,” said Baruch College President S. David Wu. “Professor He’s work exemplifies the high-impact scholarship that is deeply connected to the public good. We are proud to see Baruch contributing meaningfully to the energy transition and to the future of American innovation.”

“Professor He’s interdisciplinary approach to understanding clean-energy manufacturing will not only advance policy debates but also broaden experiential learning opportunities for our students,” said Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Linda Essig.

“Professor He’s scholarship showcases Marxe School’s research on public policy, climate solutions, and economic development,” said Sherry Ryan, Dean of the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs. “This award not only elevates our research profile but also expands opportunities for our students to engage in cutting-edge, high-impact work.”

“The proposed research project is an ambitious and timely effort that pairs national-level analysis of clean energy incentives with detailed, sector-focused case studies,” said Evan Michelson, director of the Sloan Foundation’s Energy and Environment program. “We are so pleased that this interdisciplinary team has been assembled to address complex questions that could inform decision-making on clean energy interventions at many levels.”

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday’s separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Maryland, Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

The author argues that communities can negotiate terms with data center companies to ensure local benefits and responsible development.

Modern data centers are being built with cleaner, more efficient technology, including renewable energy and closed-loop cooling systems.

Building this digital infrastructure is seen as vital for keeping Wisconsin's economy competitive with other states.

(Editor's Note: This column was updated for minor editing to add clarity.)

Charlie Berens has a real gift for capturing what people love about this state. As someone who is a voice for the unions that represent nearly 50,000 skilled tradespeople across Wisconsin, I value those who share what an amazing place we live and work in.

That’s why I paid attention when he engaged on data centers. He has made a career out of bringing to life the Wisconsin working guy we all know and love - flannel shirt, Kwik Trip runs, and all. Well, those same folks he channels? They're the ones building these facilities. I was disappointed to see data centers painted as a threat to Wisconsin.

We don’t see it that way. These projects support our members’ lives, and those who do this work every day experience the story differently from what’s gaining traction online. The digital future our world is moving toward is tied to this infrastructure, and it can be a powerful catalyst for community growth when done right.

Doing Wisconsin data centers right is what matters

Done right. That part matters. Communities have the power to negotiate the terms of these projects. It is not a situation where we have no say. Local leaders can require community benefits that make a real difference for decades. That might be infrastructure upgrades that utilize renewable resources, support for schools, investments in roads, or a tax agreement that takes pressure off homeowners. We must set expectations early, and hold companies to them.

Here’s the thing: for us in the building trades, data centers aren’t some big, scary mystery. They’re high-skill, long-term work. The kind of work that feeds families, pays mortgages, and sends kids to college. They’re complex builds that require skilled blue-collar workers, such as electricians, ironworkers, and operators.

This is the work that builds the middle class. It sustains local construction workforces for years, and gives our apprentices the chance to learn cutting-edge skills that translate to our factories, hospitals, and utilities. It also means continued maintenance work and high-tech jobs when construction ends. When people talk about jobs that allow families to stay in the communities they grew up in, this is the sort of project they are talking about.

Misinformation plagues environmental impact of data centers

There is also significant misinformation about the environmental impact of data centers. A few years ago, the concerns Berens highlights were major considerations. The technology is constantly evolving, and these facilities now operate cleaner and more efficiently than many other projects currently under construction. For example, one recently proposed Wisconsin data center would be powered by 750 mW of new renewable energy generation with a closed-loop cooling design that would not impact local water supply.

Our tradespeople fish the same lakes and hunt in the same woods we all do, they would not support something that threatens those places. We live here, too.

These projects also keep Wisconsin competitive. If we want our small businesses, schools, clinics, and communities to thrive, we need reliable digital infrastructure, attracting future-focused skill sets. Other states are competing aggressively for this investment. While we shouldn’t accept those investments lightly, we should weigh the fact that they can pay dividends for decades if we negotiate strong agreements and insist on responsible development.

Our members love Packers Sundays, Friday fish fries, and a good old-fashioned. We're bumping into each other at Fleet Farm on Saturday mornings. But we also need good jobs and strong communities. We hope Charlie will listen to some of us who see opportunity, not catastrophe, in building the infrastructure that supports the next generation of work.

IEIF Executive Director Alex Crowley said Bloomington Energy Works plans to do its best with its current funding.","A city program launched Dec. 10 offers homeowners and building owners free guidance on how to implement clean energy solutions.

Bloomington Energy Works funds energy usage audits and outreach efforts as part of a national program to build the market for clean energy projects like solar systems or electric vehicles that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

Shawn Miya, assistant director of sustainability at Bloomington’s Economic and Sustainable Development Department, said the program will help the community save on energy bills while pushing Bloomington toward its Climate Action Plan goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% below 2018 emission levels by 2030.

For the first stage of the program, Bloomington Energy Works hired energy development company Donovan Energy, which provides consulting services for businesses interested in reducing their carbon output and energy bills.

Developers and large building owners who apply and are selected can receive free technical assistance, which could include an analysis on 12 months of energy usage data or an on-site visit to determine the best path to improving the building’s energy usage.

Donovan Energy could also provide recommendations for specific clean energy projects or a financial analysis of potential solutions, including information on possible cost-saving measures like tax credits or incentives.

The possible solutions include measures like solar energy systems, optimized temperature controls, LED lighting and electric vehicle charging stations.

To inform homeowners and residents on clean energy solutions, Bloomington Energy Works hired local green energy nonprofit Electrify Indiana to spearhead community involvement and outreach.

Electrify Indiana is seeking adults and high schoolers to serve as “Energy Navigators,” who will give educational presentations or go door to door informing residents on solutions for energy efficiency and financial incentives or cost-saving measures for implementing the solutions.

It is also looking for homeowners who have implemented electric energy solutions like induction stoves, heat pumps or solar panels to host a show-and-tell displaying the technology.

Building owners or homeowners in or near Bloomington can learn more on the Bloomington Energy Works website, or watch its launch webinar for detailed information.

The City of Bloomington launched the program in partnership with the Indiana Energy Independence Fund, a nonprofit “green bank,” or financial institution that facilitates investment in green energy projects.

IEIF paid for the project with a $250,000 Municipal Investment Fund grant, a funding opportunity designed by the Coalition for Green Capital, a national nonprofit green bank. ICLEI USA, a national chapter of a global network for sustainable urban development, awarded the funding to the IEIF with the intention of using it for Bloomington’s program.

Through the MIF program, about 49 local and tribal governments and nonprofits have received $250,000 each to help create a list of potential public-private partnership plans.

By April 15, Miya said Bloomington Energy Works plans to create and submit a public-private partnership plan for the second phase of the MIF program, which will select 10 of the original grantees for an additional $2 million in funding to further develop the project plans.

The Coalition for Green Capital is partly funded with money from the National Clean Investment Fund, a program of the Inflation Reduction Act. Earlier this year, the Trump administration froze billions of dollars of that funding.

In response, CGC filed a lawsuit against Citibank, the bank holding the grant money.

CGC plans to build the funds for the next phase of the MIF grant through “philanthropic and private resources,” according to a statement from ICLEI USA in July.

Miya said the outlook of what money Bloomington and other cities would get is uncertain.

“Everything is potential at this point,” Miya said.

IEIF Executive Director Alex Crowley said Bloomington Energy Works plans to do its best with its current funding.

""This is a great beginning, or down payment grant. We will optimize that, and then let's set ourselves up to compete for whatever's available,” Crowley said.

If the next phase of the grant is able to be funded, Crowley said Bloomington Energy Works could be positioned to stand out against other applications.

Indiana lacks tools like Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy, a system for financing clean energy projects available in other parts of the country, and many Indiana counties ban solar energy installations.

The EPA estimates that 80 percent of wetlands in the U.S. would fall outside the definition of “Waters of the United States” and thus would not be under federal protection under the new rule.
“Our developments take multiple years to plan, build, and this proposed definition will finally give us a consistent set of rules that will provide much needed predictability,” he said.
Environmental groups say the rule would jeopardize protections for wetlands that protect water quality in rivers and streams and public drinking water systems.
If we are not protecting our wetlands and headwater streams to suck up that stormwater, downstream communities bear the consequence,” he said.","This week, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency heard testimony in Pittsburgh from environmental groups, scientists and industry representatives about proposed changes to the enforcement of the Clean Water Act.

The Trump administration says the new rules are needed to comply with a recent Supreme Court ruling in the 2023 Sackett decision, which said wetlands receiving federal protection must have a “continuous surface connection” to a river, stream or other waterway.

The EPA estimates that 80 percent of wetlands in the U.S. would fall outside the definition of “Waters of the United States” and thus would not be under federal protection under the new rule. Some would still be protected by state laws, as would be the case in Pennsylvania.

Wes Brooks, deputy assistant administrator in EPA’s Office of Water, said at the hearing that the current rules created under the Biden Administration did not abide by the Sackett decision. The new rules, Brooks said, would make it easier for businesses to operate.

“Under the proposed rule, small, isolated [water] features that lack a surface water connection to adjacent rivers, streams, lakes, or oceans do not satisfy [the Supreme Court’s] conditions to warrant federal oversight, and therefore would fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of states and tribes to manage and conserve as they see fit,” said Brooks.

The new rules are favored by developers, ranchers, farmers and those in other industries.

Glenn Stoltzfus of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau operates a 700-cow dairy farm in Somerset County. He testified that current rules make it hard for farmers like him to operate.

“Many of these farms operate close to streams and wetlands. These changes would significantly reduce regulatory burden and provide greater operational flexibility,” Stoltzfus said.

He said that complying with current regulations to do things like maintaining drainage ditches, installing irrigation systems and maintaining farm ponds is difficult.

”The cost of hiring consultants to determine whether or not you are in compliance when trying to expand your operation sometimes can be astronomical,” he said.

The panel also heard from industries like road construction and home building.

Hans Klinger of the Home Builders Association of Virginia said the new definition would make it easier for builders to know which areas require a federal clean water permit.

“Our developments take multiple years to plan, build, and this proposed definition will finally give us a consistent set of rules that will provide much needed predictability,” he said.

Environmental groups say the rule would jeopardize protections for wetlands that protect water quality in rivers and streams and public drinking water systems.

Patrick Shirey, an assistant professor of geology and environmental science at the University of Pittsburgh, says reducing wetland protection in an age of climate change will hurt water quality.

“Storms are getting heavier, more frequent, and more devastating. If we are not protecting our wetlands and headwater streams to suck up that stormwater, downstream communities bear the consequence,” he said.

“In the long run, when we realize the degradation of our nation’s waters from dredging and filling wetlands…the consequence is to the future generations” to pay for, he said.

Eric Harder, the Youghiogheny Riverkeeper at the Mountain Watershed Association, called the rule change a “handout” to industry because it would allow developers to more easily build in areas that had been previously considered wetlands.

“This is just another tool for them to use to make it easier to build their proposal or operation and really limit the amount of public…interaction that can be done.”",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/47909150741_cb55893f9d_k.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:00:30.605552

From Westlands Water District

Today, the Westlands Water District Board of Directors voted to certify the Final Program Environmental Impact Report (FPEIR) and adopt Findings of Fact under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the Valley Clean Infrastructure Plan (VCIP). This action underscores Westlands’ leadership in charting a path forward for District growers and rural communities grappling with the impacts of widespread land fallowing driven by inadequate and unreliable water supplies and the ongoing implementation of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA).

This year alone, chronic water shortages have forced more than 215,000 acres—roughly 38% of the District’s irrigable farmland—out of production, with additional acreage expected to be fallowed as SGMA further constrains groundwater use. These reductions jeopardize the thousands of jobs supported by the District and threaten the economic stability of rural communities whose essential services depend on the revenues generated by active agricultural production.

The VCIP offers a responsible, forward-looking land-use strategy that helps preserve the long-term viability of agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley. The plan repurposes up to 136,000 acres of drainage-impaired and water supply-limited lands for solar generation, energy storage, and transmission infrastructure, using previously cultivated acreage to support clean energy development while reducing pressure to build on undisturbed lands. In doing so, VCIP supports SGMA implementation and helps protect critical infrastructure from subsidence. The VCIP provides landowners with new, stable revenue streams through long-term leases, and allows growers to concentrate limited water supplies on their most productive and resilient acreage.

At full buildout, VCIP could generate up to 21 gigawatts of renewable energy, create thousands of construction and long-term jobs, and help California meet its statewide renewable energy goals. Through implementation of the board-affirmed community benefits commitment, local communities will directly share in the economic and social advantages of the clean-energy transition.

“Inadequate and unpredictable water supplies, made worse by SGMA’s demands, have forced more than 215,000 acres out of production this year alone, with real consequences for hardworking family farmers, workers and rural communities,” said Allison Febbo, General Manager of Westlands Water District. “Westlands is leading in finding solutions that protect the future of farming in the District and provide landowners with viable alternatives when water simply isn’t available. VCIP does exactly that. It strengthens the District’s agricultural resilience by giving fallowed acreage a new purpose, generating stable revenue streams for landowners, and helping preserve family farms for the next generation.”

Next Steps

Adoption of VCIP establishes a long-term blueprint for developing clean-energy facilities and supporting transmission infrastructure on repurposed lands that can no longer sustain irrigated agriculture. Certification of the FPEIR and adoption of VCIP allow the District and its partners to begin advancing project-level planning, permitting, and implementation steps.

Implementation of VCIP is supported by new authorities granted under AB 2661 (Soria 2024), which allow the District to develop, construct, and own solar generation, battery storage, and transmission facilities identified in the plan and require the District to adopt a community benefits plan. The District will also evaluate placing these facilities under the operational control of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). Westlands will continue working with stakeholders on environmental compliance, land-use coordination, and phased development activities consistent with the adopted plan.",https://mavensnotebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Solar-panels-pixabay.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:03:50.987990

“They're cancelling a number of large EVs that they had planned, but they're not abandoning the EV market,” Tucker said.
Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.","Ford is scrapping plans to make fully electric full-sized pickups.

Ford will take a roughly $20 billion hit, but the company expects the recalibration of its electric vehicle strategy to prove more profitable in the long run.

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said the “customer-driven shift” will strengthen the company.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business,” Farley said in an announcement Monday.

Kelley Blue Book automotive expert Sean Tucker said the cancellation of the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup headlines the changes announced by Ford.

“They're cancelling a number of large EVs that they had planned, but they're not abandoning the EV market,” Tucker said.

Ford said it still expects about half of its global inventory will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030, up from 17% this year.

And the company has big plans for its universal EV platform, which will be used to roll out lower-priced, smaller cars and trucks, beginning with a midsize pickup in 2027.

Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV uses gas power to recharge the EV battery, but the gas doesn't directly power the vehicle's movement.

The engine is effectively a generator, not actually attached to the drivetrain in any way, Tucker said.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.

“All trucks lose about half the range when they tow, regardless of what their fuel source is,” Tucker said. “But that's a much bigger deal when stopping to recharge takes hours than it is when stopping to fill a tank takes two minutes.”

Plus, big trucks are most popular in the parts of the country where EV infrastructure is poor, Tucker said.

Ford said the next-generation extended-range EV, or EREV, F-150 Lightning will add an estimated 700-plus mile range and tow “like a locomotive.”

Tucker said Ford made the right call.

“It was an understandable decision in 2021 to say, ‘Our bestselling product is the F-150. Why don’t we just electrify our bestselling product first?’ But the market for electric full-size trucks is just, it hasn't really emerged,” Tucker said. “And I think that the EREV is probably a more realistic technology, that the sort of person who's interested in a full-size truck might listen to that more than they would to a pure EV.”

RELATED STORY: Trump tries to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements

Tucker said KBB estimates that dealers have about a 147-day supply of fully electric F-150 Lightning trucks, so folks who want to buy one still have time.

Tucker said American automakers have a tough time balancing domestic and international markets, with about a quarter of the overseas market already electric. Stateside, it’s just 7% or so, Tucker said.

That creates a two-tiered, expensive production strategy, one for the North American market and one for the rest of the world.

Tucker said the U.S. market is still moving toward EVs, but it’s moving more slowly than initial projections.

And Tucker said Ford’s decisions have more to do with market demands than politics, with President Donald Trump trying to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements.

“Politicians want a lot of headlines talking about the automotive industry, but the automotive industry does not move at the speed of politics,” Tucker said. “If you sit down to design a new car today, it's going to roll out to the public in about five to seven years. It's a long design cycle. So, I don't think they're making a lot of quick decisions based on something the president did last month.”",https://bakersfieldnow.com/resources/media2/16x9/8380/1320/47x575/90/443d8481-4e5a-4d33-97ee-293b7f730794-GettyImages2252102754.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:01:31.234235

AUSTIN – Here’s what the Texas Transportation Commission discussed and approved at its December meeting.

Year at a glance

Acting Commission Chair Alvin New presented a recap of notable accomplishments and events the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) saw in 2025.

When devastating flooding impacted Central Texas in July, 869 TxDOT employees from across the state responded to repair and reopen roads, clear debris and inspect bridges. In the Austin area, Cow Creek bridge was rebuilt just 29 days after being swept away.

Crews responded to other severe weather events across the state, including winter weather and dust storms in North Texas. TxDOT employees also responded to numerous dangerous situations while out in the field, helping save citizens from flooded roads and vehicle fires.

TxDOT celebrated the opening of the new Harbor Bridge in Corpus Christi in June. The $1.3 billion project is the longest concrete segmental cable-stayed bridge in North America.

The 89th Legislative Session brought new legislation that enhances TxDOT’s ability to recruit and maintain employees, as well as support for aviation, rail and maritime infrastructure.

TxDOT received a renewal in its participation in the Federal Highway Association’s National Environmental Policy Act assignment program.

TxDOT continued to set records in construction. The department currently has more than $60 billion in active construction projects.

Construction milestones included the groundbreaking of the Spur 399 widening, I-27 and I-69 unveilings, new bridges in the Atlanta area and the demolition of old bridges.

The Paris District opened its new district headquarters building.

TxDOT used a robotic dog for mapping, including the surveying of a cave in the Austin area. In San Antonio, another cave was preserved to protect endangered cave species. And an archaeological excavation in Lubbock uncovered prehistoric animal bones.

HERO (Highway Emergency Response Operator) launched a program in the Odessa area.

Adopt a Highway celebrated 40 years.

Texas Clear Lanes congestion relief initiative celebrated 10 years of progress.

12 Days of Safety Blitzen

This year, Texas is currently on track to have the lowest number of roadway deaths in more than five years, showing a promising downward trend – even compared to national levels.

TxDOT wants drivers to keep this downward trend going by making safe driving decisions this holiday season, ensuring everyone can have a happy holiday season with loved ones. TxDOT is sharing safe driving messages on digital highway signs and “12 Days of Safety” messaging on social media during December.

Senior leadership

TxDOT appointed two new senior leaders. Saul Romero is the new Odessa District Engineer, and Katie Martin is the new Atlanta District Engineer.

Employee recognition

Two TxDOT employees were honored at the 2025 American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials annual meeting.

Construction Engineer Ray Buzalsky was awarded the Thomas H. MacDonald Memorial Award for five decades of service, and Transportation Engineer Amanda Austin was awarded the President’s Transportation Award for her work on Roundabout and Alternative Intersection Design.

Aviation

The Commission awarded $18.7 million in state and federal grant funding for capital improvement projects at 10 airports.

Contracts

The commissioners awarded low-bid value amounts of $589 million for 61 highway improvement projects and $31 million for 22 routine maintenance projects.

Utility relocation

The Commission approved the state payment of utility relocation on SH 185 in Victoria County at the cost of $932,000.",https://www.txdot.gov/content/dam/images/icons/TxDOT-favicon-large.svg,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:33.896776

Prefabricated stations deployed in 2025 can charge up to 14 vehicles simultaneously, depending on the site, and exclusively feature high-power 350kW fast chargers.","EVgo, one of the largest providers of public fast charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the U.S., has deployed more than 40% of its stations this year by leveraging domestically manufactured prefabricated modular skids.

EVgo exceeded its goal before year-end, driven by a high rate of new station commissionings early in the fourth quarter. The Company’s partnership with Miller Electric Company (“Miller Electric”), a leading electrical contractor based in Jacksonville, Florida, with expertise in complex electrical systems, has led to accelerated station installation timelines and a decrease in station installation costs by an average of 15%.

Prefabrication ensures consistent, high-quality assembly in a controlled environment by assembling all charging equipment onto a single base frame made from American steel and aluminum at Miller Electric’s facility before shipment to the installation site. Since the partnership first launched in 2023, EVgo’s expanded work with Miller Electric has supported local job creation. Miller Electric has scaled capacity at its prefabrication facility and employs more than 1,400 people in the Jacksonville area.

“The prefabrication model is a win-win for EVgo because we can fast-track infrastructure deployment to meet charging demand and support workforce development in this growing industry,” said Dennis Kish, President of EVgo. “Utilizing prefabricated modular skids from Miller Electric is key to scaling EVgo’s nationwide network.”

“By prefabricating EV skids, we’re able to deliver consistent, high-quality installations while reducing timelines and costs. This approach accelerates infrastructure deployment and supports domestic manufacturing and job creation—key pillars for a sustainable future. This collaboration with EVgo demonstrates innovation and efficiency in the EV charging industry,” said Pat Eliason, Group President at Miller Electric.

In addition to cost and time efficiencies, prefabrication can seamlessly integrate features that enhance customer experience such as Wi-Fi infrastructure, lighting, security cameras, and canopies.

Solx expects to create more than two hundred direct jobs in Aguadilla and dozens more across Puerto Rico through its logistics, engineering, and distribution networks. With an investment exceeding $60 million, Solx seeks to position Puerto Rico as a major player in domestic solar panel manufacturing.

“Solx is commissioning a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that leverages Puerto Rico’s highly skilled workforce, robust incentives, and strategic geographic location,” said Jose A. Torres, Managing Partner of MCP. “This partnership offers investors a flagship opportunity to participate in the renewable energy makeover underway on the island. It also aligns with MCP’s mission to catalyze sustainable, locally anchored economic development.”

MCP offers investors multiple tax-efficient pathways to participate in the Solx offering. These include investments through the Puerto Rico Opportunity Zone Fund II (PROZ II) - a qualified opportunity Fund, Puerto Rico Private Equity Funds under Act 60, and other vehicles designed to optimize federal and local tax treatment for qualifying accredited investors.

James Holmes, Co-Founder and CEO of Solx, added: “Solx exists to bring critical manufacturing capability back to the United States. Our mission is to make America energy independent – permanently. We accomplish this by giving developers a stable, reliable supply chain they can count on. Our commitment is to deliver premium, domestically manufactured solar modules with the innovation, quality, and resilience required to power America’s energy future. We are proud to build that capability here in Puerto Rico and to make advanced solar technology accessible nationwide.”

The MIPA represents one of MCP’s most significant commitments in the renewable energy sector in Puerto Rico to date and forms part of a broader investment strategy supporting the island’s increasing resilience and economic development.

“Solx has the technology, the leadership, and the strategic importance to become an anchor manufacturer in Puerto Rico’s clean energy transition,” said Shawn Hanson, Managing Partner at MCP. “FEOC compliance is essential for utility scale and commercial solar projects.

2025 is set to be another record-breaking year for energy storage after the U.S. installed 12.9 GW in the first three quarters, surpassing 2024’s total installed capacity of 12.3 GW, according to a Tuesday report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.

At the same time, prices for utility-scale battery systems have dropped 11% year-over-year, from $1,050/kW to $938/kW, the report found.

“Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, in a release. “Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”

2025 is on track to increase new capacity installments by 54% over last year, the report said. However, the market is still adapting to supply chain constraints that have emerged as the result of tariffs and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s new foreign entity of concern rules for claiming Inflation Reduction Act credits.

The OBBBA largely spared energy storage from the harshest cuts it made to the IRA’s clean energy tax credits. The report noted that its utility-scale five-year storage forecast “has increased 15% compared to pre-[OBBBA] projections, while the [community-scale, commercial and industrial] segment is projected to grow 23% from 2025 to 2029.”

Wood Mackenzie projects a 10% contraction in 2026 across all segments and another drop in 2027 before the storage sector rebounds with double-digit year-over-year growth projected for 2028 and 2029 as domestic manufacturing capacity comes online.

“The market is positioned for strong recovery,” it said.

Dana Nessel has filed an opinion in the case before the Michigan Public Service Commission. Consumers have asked for a 10% hike on gas customers.

Big picture view:

Consumers Energy is looking for a $240 million increase in its gas rates, which would come out to approximately an 8% increase for residential customers.

The MPSC approved a previous hike from Consumers three months earlier, authorizing a $157.5 million increase in rates.

This is the fourth year in a row that the utility has asked for an increase.

Consumers Energy sells gas to 1.8 million households in Michigan, including in Southeast Michigan.

The original filing is available here.

What they're saying:

Nessel said the public service commission has repeatedly authorized reduced increases compared to what Consumers has asked for.

""Consumers Energy has consistently filed these rate hike requests filled with unjustifiable costs, and my office has consistently intervened to ensure any unfair or indefensible costs are not foisted onto its customers,"" she said. ""This happens over and over again and amounts to millions of dollars. My office will once again thoroughly review this latest request, which – based on nearly every past experience with Consumers Energy – will undoubtedly contain many of the same unjustified and overstated costs we’ve seen time and again from its incessant rate hike requests.""

The other side:

Consumers Energy says it will ""stand by our natural gas rate request.""

Spokesperson Megan Kirk with Consumers Energy released a statement saying:

""(We) will demonstrate to the Public Service Commission that our proposals are needed to continue heating homes and businesses safely, reliably and affordably. Our customers’ rates today are below the state, Midwest and national average, and we will continue to work actively to squeeze every dollar out of our system for the well-being of our customers.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox2detroit.com/www.fox2detroit.com/content/uploads/2023/08/1280/720/GettyImages-1239647204.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:17.103135

The fund said the rising leverage ratio reflects strengthening international confidence in Oman's industrial, manufacturing, and clean energy ambitions.

Job creation remains a key performance indicator. Projects approved since launch have generated more than 1,400 jobs, with thousands more in progress. Investments span five national priority clusters , energy transition, advanced materials, healthcare, logistics, and information and communications technology, reinforcing the fund's role in shaping the country's next phase of economic growth.

Flagship developments include a $1.6 billion solar-grade polysilicon manufacturing facility by United Solar, scheduled for completion in 2026. The project has already supported over 1,000 jobs and delivered more than $317 million in in-country value, while also attracting interest from international development finance institutions. Another major project is JA Solar's six-gigawatt solar cell manufacturing complex in the SOHAR Port and Freezone, a $442 million investment nearing key construction milestones. Once operational, the facility is expected to employ more than 500 people and expand Oman's foothold in regional clean energy supply chains.

Momentum also continues under the fund's SME and venture capital mandate. Since inception, 132 SME and VC projects have been approved, with $56.7 million committed and $37.4 million deployed through eight specialized vehicles covering pre-seed, seed, growth equity, and SME debt. Application volumes remain strong across both mandates, driven by sustained domestic and international interest in projects linked to industrial modernization, technology development, and clean energy.

Since launch, the fund has assessed 828 proposals and approved 141 projects valued at around $3.4 billion, spanning nine major strategic investments and 132 SME and venture capital initiatives. Its dual mandate guides capital toward both large national projects and smaller high-growth businesses, with a targeted 12 percent return and a 40 percent equity ceiling per investment.

(P&GJ) — The U.S. Department of Energy has granted Woodside Energy an additional 44 months to begin exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to non-free trade agreement countries from its Woodside Louisiana LNG project under construction in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright signed an amendment order on Dec. 16 extending the project’s export commencement deadline. Once fully constructed, the facility is expected to be capable of exporting up to 3.88 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas as LNG.

Woodside Louisiana LNG reached a final investment decision on its first phase earlier this year. The project has secured long-term offtake agreements with Germany’s Uniper, while U.S. midstream operator Williams is expected to market natural gas through the facility.

“It is exciting to take this action to provide the needed runway for this project to fully take off and realize its potential in providing reliable and secure energy to the world,” said Kyle Haustveit, assistant secretary of the Office of Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy. “Thanks to President Trump's leadership, the Department of Energy is redefining what it means to unleash American energy to strengthen energy reliability and affordability for American families, businesses, and our allies.”

Dive Brief:

The Environmental Protection Agency last week launched a webpage to provide local communities and data center developers with “a central location for Clean Air Act (CAA)-related resources,” including regulatory information, guidance and technical tools designed to accelerate the ability to build data centers and the backup power generation they require, according to a press release.

Also last week, a coalition of more than 230 national, state and local organizations sent a letter to Congress calling for a nationwide moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, saying their rapid expansion “presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.”

“We are seeing how difficult it is to move any policies forward at the federal level,” Jim Walsh, policy director for Food and Water Watch, told Smart Cities Dive. “In the near term, it’s more likely that states, counties or municipal governments would enact moratoriums until there are standards in place to actually address the litany of concerns about data centers.”

Dive Insight:

Tech companies are investing billions of dollars to build data centers to train and run AI platforms.

President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order forbidding state AI laws that conflict with his administration’s AI-forward policies and threatening to restrict federal funding if their laws are found to be burdensome. That order follows one Trump signed in January calling for a national AI action plan “to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in July that the EPA was “committed to increasing certainty in the permitting process that is crucial to securing power demand for data centers” and partnering with state, local, and tribal air-quality agencies to promote “ways for Americans to invest and develop AI domestically.”

EPA is updating Clean Air Act rules requiring companies to “maintain proper pollution control” that it says “have not been updated to reflect technological advancements of the 21st century,” according to last week’s press release.

“EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback,” Zeldin said in a statementannouncing the new website. The website furthers two core pillars of that initiative: making the U.S. the AI capital of the world and “advancing cooperative federalism,” according to the press release.

In their letter to Congress, the environmental organizations stated that tripling the number of data centers in the next five years would require as much electricity as about 30 million households, as much water as about 18.5 million households and contribute to escalating electricity costs.

Bloomberg reported in September that wholesale power costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers.

U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced Thursday that they are opening an investigation into “alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as AI data centers’ energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities.”

“City leaders are faced with significant challenges when data centers decide to locate in their communities, because the data centers themselves are so resource-intensive, both in terms of energy and water usage, it can be challenging for a municipality to actually evaluate and understand the full impacts of what permitting that data center in their community might be,” Walsh said.

Walsh said Trump’s executive order “doesn’t do anything to prevent local communities from exercising their existing powers” to enact moratoriums on building new data centers in their jurisdictions.

Local governments are beginning to push back.

Latin America is at a pivotal moment, when strategic actions can significantly reshape its economic future.","The world is entering a new era characterized by significant changes. The global order is in the midst of shifting from a unipolar to a multipolar structure, with recent developments in trade policies reshaping global dynamics. The green transition is spurring increased demand for key commodities and final goods, while the expanding middle class and global population growth are putting pressure on land use systems and raising concerns about food security. In addition, the rapid advancement of new technological platforms is transforming production and the competitive landscape across industries.

These global trends present challenges and opportunities for all countries. But Latin America’s competitive strengths make the region particularly well positioned to meet the moment. Its abundant and cost-competitive renewable energy and talented workforce could enable Latin America to benefit from an ever more digital and compute-intensive global economy. Further, its rich, diverse natural resources put the region at an advantage amid rising demand for food, energy, and critical minerals. Meanwhile, its production capabilities, geographic location, and relatively neutral geopolitical stance could offer its advanced-manufacturing sector a competitive edge.

Of course, we recognize that Latin America is made up of a diverse mix of economies, peoples, and histories. Indeed, the notion of “Latin America” as a single entity may resonate more outside the region than within it. Nevertheless, our research grapples with the idea that Latin America has been a land of unrealized potential for more than 50 years. As we see it, the current global shifts present a once-in-a-generation chance to change course. The region’s investment levels and productivity output have struggled to keep pace in a rapidly shifting global economy, and the expansion of its labor force is losing steam. Moreover, about 60 percent of the population today lives below the empowerment line, and it faces the prospect of “getting old before getting rich” due to demographic pressures and a weak growth outlook.

If GDP growth per capita persists at recent rates, it will rise only 19 percent by 2040—just one-third of emerging Asia’s growth over the same period. Therefore, growth will be critical to enable more households to meet their basic needs and start to save. This report explores pathways Latin America can take to jump-start productivity and enable its population to reach high-income status.

Increasing Latin America’s productivity and closing investment gaps

Increased investment and more effective capital allocation are essential to achieve higher productivity growth in Latin America and unlock the region’s full potential. Historically, low investment has hindered productivity in the region. Over the past 25 years, additional capital per worker boosted the region’s productivity growth by just 0.9 percentage points a year, half that of its peers.

From 1997 to 2022, productivity accounted for 35 percent of Latin America’s GDP growth (0.8 percentage points of the total 2.3 percentage points of growth), reflecting the region’s persistent underinvestment in capital-deepening sectors. This is significantly lower than the contribution seen in comparable countries, which achieved at least double or triple Latin America’s rate. For example, Poland and Türkiye achieved 3.5 and 3.0 percentage points, respectively.

If Latin America had matched the productivity growth of its peers such as Egypt, Poland, and Türkiye over this period, its GDP in 2023 would have been 60 to 110 percent higher and the region could have reached high-income status, on average (Exhibit 1).

Weak local investment is a primary contributor to slow productivity growth. In Latin America, gross fixed capital formation, a metric for total investment in an economy’s stock of assets, is approximately 20 percent of GDP, on average, trailing comparable regions (Emerging Asia and Central and Eastern Europe) and countries such as Türkiye and Malaysia. From 1997 to 2019, Latin America’s capital stock per worker grew by only 30 percent, while countries such as Poland and Türkiye experienced a twofold jump in this metric and achieved productivity growth rates two to three times higher than that of Latin America.

A high-income scenario by 2040 would require accelerating productivity growth to match the rate of faster-growing peers

What would Latin America’s productivity look like in the coming years with higher growth? We conducted an analysis of 14 comparable economies that produced two scenarios (see sidebar, “About the productivity growth methodology”). The high-case scenario represents the median of the yearly average productivity growth of these 14 countries during the past two decades, while the low-case scenario represents the average of the lowest quartile.

If Latin America’s productivity growth matched the low- and high-case scenarios of these reference economies, it would achieve a jump of 1.1 and 2.0 percentage points, respectively, beyond the region’s yearly average productivity growth of 0.6 percentage points over the past 20 years. An annual average productivity growth rate of 1.7 to 2.6 percent would enable Latin America to reach a GDP range of $8.9 trillion to $10.3 trillion (in 2023 dollars) by 2040.

Growth of 2.6 percent annually could be achievable for Latin America, given that half the countries in the sample exceeded this level. Although a jump in productivity growth from 0.8 percent to 2.6 percent might seem ambitious, more than a third of the countries we analyzed have recorded even larger increases over the past two decades. This precedent suggests that with the right strategies, Latin America could achieve these growth rates, paving the way for significant economic expansion.

Average annual investment of $1.9 trillion to $2.3 trillion through 2040 could enable Latin America’s GDP growth

The growth of middle-income economies depends on sufficient levels of investment, among other variables. Based on the correlation between capital per worker and productivity as countries develop economically, achieving a GDP of $8.9 trillion to $10.3 trillion in Latin America by 2040 would likely require average annual total investment in the range of $1.9 trillion to $2.3 trillion.

Assuming the region’s GDP reaches the high-case scenario of $10.3 trillion, this ramp-up of investment could reach approximately 28 percent of GDP by 2040, up from 20 percent today and aligned with other fast-growing regions such as China (around 40 percent), Türkiye (31 percent), and India (30 percent) over the past 20 years.

Unlocking Latin America’s growth potential amid global shifts

Four trends, from changing global power dynamics and technological advancements to demographic transitions and evolving resource and energy systems, are influencing the course of the global economy. Together, they could usher in a new era of economic opportunity, but they also bring specific challenges.

Multipolar world

The global order is shifting from a unipolar to a multipolar structure. Global integration still shapes trade, migration, capital flows, and intangibles (such as knowledge transfer), but underlying trends are evolving. Recently, trade has been reconfiguring along geopolitical lines. Since 2017, the average geopolitical distance of goods trade has fallen by 4 to 10 percent for economies such as China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Meanwhile, economies such as Brazil and India have achieved high trading volumes across the geopolitical spectrum. As countries seek to mitigate risks, supply chains could become more regionally concentrated or aligned with countries with similar geopolitical goals.

Although this trend poses economic challenges, it also creates opportunities. Regions or countries with strategic geographic locations, neutral geopolitical stances, or significant reserves of resources (such as those critical to the energy transition) could strengthen their position in new supply chains and address emerging demand.

Technological advancements

Rapid technological advances, particularly in AI, cloud computing, and digital services, could open a $100 billion export opportunity for Latin America in knowledge-based services. To convey the magnitude of the opportunity, total global revenues for AI software and services and cloud could rise to as much as $8 trillion by 2040. Together, they could be two of the most dynamic and mutually reinforcing arenas of growth in the decades ahead, with multitrillion-dollar revenue opportunities and significant productivity impact on the rest of the economy.

This growth is fueling demand for IT services, business process outsourcing (BPO), and digital infrastructure. Global data center IT load, for example, is projected to quadruple from 55 gigawatts (GW) in 2023 to 219 GW by 2030, creating an opportunity for certain regions to both supply services and cover the infrastructure gap.

Demographic transitions

The world is undergoing a profound demographic transformation. Fertility rates are declining, leading to aging populations in many regions. This trend increases pressure on healthcare and social security systems and could result in labor shortages, widening regional inequalities, and the erosion of intergenerational wealth. Further, the world’s rural population reached a peak in 2020 and has since started to shrink. This urban expansion will predominantly occur outside the Western world.

As these developments raise new challenges around the world, they also bring evolving consumption patterns that could create new opportunities. Overall population growth, rising incomes, and urbanization will increase demand for manufactured goods, energy, and food. Indeed, global demand for food is projected to rise more than 40 percent by 2040, which will create an opening for producers across sectors.

Resource and energy systems

The global shift toward cleaner energy sources is underway, guided by ambitions to reach net-zero emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuel. Yet this transition is complex and requires a balance among energy security, affordability, industrial competitiveness, and decarbonization. On the supply side, geopolitical shifts have further exposed vulnerabilities in energy and materials supply chains. On the demand side, the transition could increase the need for products and intermediate goods.

Despite record volume in renewable and electrification investments, project deployment remains below the level required to meet 2030 and 2050 targets set by countries and companies in line with the Paris Agreement. In Europe and the United States, for instance, less than 20 percent of announced solar capacity and 15 percent of hydrogen projects have reached the final investment decision stage, creating a high risk of cancellation or delay. This persistent gap means oil and gas could remain a central part of the energy mix beyond 2050 (even under accelerated transition scenarios).

Latin America is well positioned to respond to global trends

The four global trends will alter demand across sectors. While Latin America’s distinctive strengths and assets could offer new sources of growth and competitiveness, it would need to develop new capabilities and unlock more potential from existing ones. Focusing investment on sectors and countries where capabilities and new sources of demand could align offers a microlevel strategy for beginning to advance the region’s possibilities. Where such investments succeed, the possibilities for broader-based growth across companies and sectors expand.

Our research examined the region’s sectors and identified three themes with the greatest potential to help the region attract investment and enhance economic growth: revitalizing Latin America’s industrial base, thriving in the age of global digitalization, and leveraging Latin America’s natural endowments.

Revitalizing Latin America’s industrial base. The changing global order presents Latin America with an opportunity to capitalize on the ongoing restructuring of global supply chains, especially for export-oriented industries such as manufacturing.

The region’s location, particularly its proximity to the North American market, offers a significant advantage in global trade. Its shipping times are roughly half those of Asia, enabling faster delivery, reducing logistics costs, and enhancing supply chain responsiveness. Further, at a time of shifting global supply chains and trade realignments, Latin America’s relative proximity to global extremes on the geopolitical spectrum could enable the region to deepen trade ties across diverse blocs, expanding exports to other countries and extending trade partnerships. In addition, Latin America’s manufacturing sectors are well placed to take advantage of the global energy transition. The region is home to some of the world’s most abundant and competitive renewable energy resources, including hydro, wind, and solar power.

By harnessing these endowments and building on existing industrial capabilities, Latin America has the potential to emerge as a key energy carrier for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Capturing this potential will require accelerating technology adoption, building know-how, strengthening supply chain integration, and deepening international openness.

Thriving in the age of global digitalization. The rapid acceleration of digital technologies is increasing global demand for digital services. Latin America is well positioned to capture this opportunity: Its advantages include strong knowledge from leading IT companies along with competitive labor costs, solid English proficiency, and highly competitive internet speeds.

Further, the region’s connectivity, competitive operating costs, and abundant renewable energy resources make it an excellent location for energy-intensive data center development. These advantages could allow Latin America to offer a sustainable and cost-effective solution to meet the rising global need for digital infrastructure. Achieving this goal will require closing gaps in digital access and infrastructure and strengthening technical training. Given that digital services and data centers are high-productivity sectors, capitalizing on these opportunities will enhance their contribution to Latin America’s economy, thereby boosting the region’s overall productivity.

Leveraging Latin America’s natural endowments. The global energy transition and AI race are driving a surge in demand for critical minerals, which are essential for renewable energy technologies and battery production. Latin America holds a significant share of the world’s reserves of materials such as lithium and copper. In addition, the region’s central geopolitical positioning could enable it to be seen as a reliable source of minerals for different trade partners.

Shifting demographics are projected to increase global food demand by more than 40 percent by 2040, presenting another opportunity for Latin America, which has 14 percent of the world’s arable land. Most Latin American and Caribbean countries could double agricultural productivity by modernizing just 25 percent of small farms with improved input application and cultivation practices. Capturing agriculture’s potential will require Latin American growers to embrace more-productive practices (such as farm equipment and automation) and reallocate resources from less- to more-productive subsectors (for example, fruits and industrial crops). Lifting labor productivity in agriculture would increase incomes for farmers while reducing overall employment share, with workers moving to higher-productivity jobs in other sectors.

These themes could add $1.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion to Latin America’s GDP by 2040

While the region has distinctive competitive advantages in each of these three themes, it still needs to address critical gaps, from human capital development, infrastructure enhancement, and macroeconomic stability to the creation of new trade corridors and expansion of current ones. Moreover, attracting investment will require coordinated action from both the public and private sectors. Nonetheless, sectors and companies are primed to build on the region’s advantages.

To understand a plausible growth scenario for Latin America, we divided the economy into two parts: sectors associated with the three themes, which currently account for 29 percent of the region’s GDP, and the rest of the economy. One potential path is for the three themes to increase by 3.0 to 5.0 percent annually, the range of productivity growth levels of benchmark countries in comparable sectors, while the rest of the economy grows 1.1 to 1.3 percent a year, a level in line with the lower-end performance of comparable economies. This rate of growth would generate an additional $1.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion to regional GDP above the current trajectory by 2040 (Exhibit 2).

This two-speed option is just one of many the region could follow to exceed $10 trillion in GDP by 2040, but it offers high-level validation of how building on strengths in certain areas could address the productivity imperative.

Seven sectors for transformative investment

The three strategic themes encompass a multitude of growth opportunities for Latin America. The region has an opportunity to transform its productivity through investments in seven high-potential sectors that exemplify the impact these themes could have on the region:

Revitalizing the industrial base.This includes next-gen manufacturing and Power-to-X solutions.

Thriving in the age of global digitalization.This includes digital services and data centers.

Extracting the potential of natural resources. This includes agri-foods, oil and gas, and critical minerals.

By 2040, these sectors could generate combined annual revenues of approximately $590 billion to $ 1.2 trillion, depending on the pace of investment, degree of policy alignment, and global demand (Exhibit 3). Achieving this growth would require cumulative investment of $1.7 trillion to $2.8 trillion through 2040.

Our analysis seeks to be ambitious and feasible while presenting a consistent view across sectors. Since the potential revenues of several sectors—next-gen manufacturing (including EVs and batteries), critical minerals, oil and gas, and Power-to-X—rely on the pace of the energy transition, we incorporated its potential impact on revenue calculations across sectors. We based the estimation of outputs for these sectors on two energy transition scenarios: continued momentum and sustainable transformation. For six of the seven sectors, continued momentum represents the low output and sustainable transformation is the high output. Oil and gas is the exception: Continued momentum is the low case, and slow evolution is the high case. When aggregating opportunities across sectors, we combined the range for oil and gas inversely with those of the others. Each sector scenario includes specific factors that are explained in the methodology section in the full report’s appendix.

For each sector, we identified the countries with the greatest potential and classified them into four archetypes, defined by the sector’s overall maturity within each country:

Global champions include regional players accounting for more than 10 percent of global exports, top five exporters, and countries with the potential to become even more relevant in the future, given emerging global trends.

Strong competitors are countries that have established robust capabilities (such as labor or technology) in a given sector but are not yet global leaders. Strong competitors are well positioned to enhance their global relevance as emerging trends reshape opportunities.

Promising contenders are regional players that hold a potential competitive edge but need to strengthen capabilities and invest in enablers to fully capture the opportunity.

Emerging frontiers are high-potential countries whose competitiveness depends on overcoming significant uncertainty through coordinated efforts and alignment among key stakeholders.

This categorization of archetypes applies to country–industry pairs, using industries within the seven sectors. It is done at the industry level because industries within the same sector in the same country could be categorized as different archetypes. For instance, Argentina’s critical minerals sector is a global champion in lithium production but a promising contender in copper, illustrating the multifaceted nature of competitiveness and the importance of strategies tailored to each industry’s stage of development. In cases where relevant opportunities did not exist for country–industry pairs, they were not categorized as an archetype.

The following interactive offers deep dives into the seven sectors, highlighting potential additional revenues, the investment required to capture the opportunity, and the performance of selected Latin American countries.

Latin America has an opportunity to transform its productivity trajectory. These seven sectors illustrate the potential across the three themes that could leverage similar capabilities. By capturing the total economic potential by 2040, the region could substantially accelerate productivity growth.

Achieving these goals would require targeted action to close capability gaps and address structural barriers. By focusing investment and policies on these areas, the region can build the skills, infrastructure, and institutional capacity needed to accelerate economic growth and create prosperity for its population in the decades ahead.

Strategic accelerators: Unlocking growth in Latin America

The sector-specific opportunities could not only have an outsize impact but also catalyze a virtuous cycle of investment and growth. To execute this strategy, we have identified four strategic accelerators that could enable the region to increase its productivity at an economy-wide level. The first two aim to take advantage of the opportunities from shifting trade patterns; the other two are capability accelerators that could help attract investment and drive productivity growth.

Diversifying and proactively opening new trade corridors

Geopolitical tensions are altering global trade. Since 2017, commerce between geopolitically distant partners has fallen, indicating the reconfiguration of trade is underway. To understand the impact of factors such as tariffs and industrial policy on trade, McKinsey research explored three scenarios, developed using the Global Trade Analysis Project. McKinsey Global Institute analysis found that more than 30 percent of global trade in 2035 could swing from one trade corridor to another.

Latin America could seek to double down on trade by opening and exploring new trade corridors. Each new one could not only create demand for the region’s production but also attract targeted investments and technology partnerships in high-growth sectors. The creation of robust trade corridors with key (and sometimes new) global trading partners would likely depend on strong agreements and cooperative frameworks. In addition, clear and predictable trade policies, together with reciprocal commitments such as local investment in priority sectors, can help strengthen the resilience and adaptability of the region’s trade network.

As noted in chapter 3 of the full report, four strategic sectors rely heavily on external demand beyond the United States: Power-to-X, agri-food, oil and gas, and critical minerals. Expanding and building new interregional corridors, such as to the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia, could also increase Latin America’s trade with emerging markets, which are expected to see above-average growth and could offer stability amid global uncertainty.

Enhancing intraregional collaboration and investment

Regional integration in Latin America remains limited relative to other major economic blocs. Its intraregional exports currently make up only about 15 percent of its total exports versus 60 percent for the European Union. Gaps in physical connectivity—particularly cross-border road and transport networks—contribute to this dynamic and remain a focus for future development.

Latin America has an opportunity to diversify its trade relations while deepening its regional integration. These twin actions could bolster the region’s resilience and strengthen connectivity among its markets. Progress would require expanding and modernizing regional trade agreements to systematically lower trade barriers, standardizing regulations, and promoting the development of cross-border supply chains and investment flows.

Regional integration can benefit most sectors, but it is essential for next-gen manufacturing. Both intermediate products (minerals, batteries, and car parts) and final products (EVs) rely on a robust supply chain. In addition, intraregional trade of energy and fossil fuels could create more-reliable energy grids.

Streamlining regulatory frameworks in key sectors

A welcoming business environment is essential for sectors where Latin America needs to attract both investment and expertise. The region’s capacity to develop complex industries such as EVs and semiconductors relies heavily on its ability to draw the right companies and technology. This effort will benefit from ongoing collaboration between public and private stakeholders to address administrative and operational bottlenecks. As laid out in the full report, a welcoming business environment created through good governance and successful investment is mutually reinforcing and can get stronger over time.

Initiatives that enhance regulatory clarity, predictability, and efficiency—particularly in priority sectors—could strengthen investor confidence and unlock stalled projects, supporting broader competitiveness across the region. Actions could involve streamlining regulatory processes and making business setup, permits, and dispute resolution more efficient while maintaining transparency and rigor. A successful effort could unlock billions of dollars in stalled projects and increase the region’s competitiveness as a manufacturing hub.

Moreover, establishing the appropriate regulatory environments could accelerate growth in sectors such as critical minerals, oil and gas, and Power-to-X, which require substantial investment and where new projects take considerable time to become operational. Efforts that enhance regulatory clarity, predictability, and efficiency—particularly in priority sectors—could strengthen investor confidence and unlock stalled projects, supporting broader competitiveness across the region.

Upskilling the future workforce

In many regions, the misalignment between educational institutions and the demands of the job market has grown considerably over the past 20 years. This situation is particularly relevant in Latin America: For example, 80 percent of companies in Colombia anticipate a shortage of skilled workers by 2027. At the same time, 84 percent of employers in Latin America plan to upskill their workforce to meet the demand for digital and tech talent.

Efforts to strengthen skills and technology adoption would likely hinge on expanding access to high-quality education and targeted training programs. Collaborative initiatives involving government, academia, and the private sector have the potential to accelerate progress, particularly if implemented at scale. Bridging the region’s talent gap would spur growth across the economy, but such efforts would have an outsize impact on certain sectors, such as digital services, data centers, and next-gen manufacturing (semiconductors and EV production).

Over the past 25 years, Latin America’s GDP growth has trailed global averages and primarily been sustained by an expanding labor force. Now, the region must enhance its productivity to meet rising economic and social needs—including education, healthcare, and social security.

Latin America is at a pivotal moment, when strategic actions can significantly reshape its economic future. This report lays out a pathway that could enable the region to increase its GDP from $6.2 trillion in 2023 to between $8.9 trillion and $10.3 trillion by 2040, sufficient to achieve high-income status.

The region could overcome a challenging macroeconomic context—not through undertaking wholesale change but by focusing on the success of specific sectors with the potential to unleash a new wave of investment and growth in the region. These strategic opportunities, which arise from the match between current and future global trends and the region’s distinctive assets, encompass three broad themes: revitalizing its industrial base, thriving in the digital age, and leveraging its natural resources. Successful efforts could help to extend investment across the region’s economy.

Fully capitalizing on these opportunities requires decisive action. Mobilizing capital, adding new trade corridors, deepening intraregional trade, modernizing regulation, and building human capital could substantially improve Latin America’s resilience and responsiveness to global shifts and close persistent investment and productivity gaps. The result could be a clear path to sustainable growth.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/americas/seizing%20the%20moment%20latin%20americas%20productivity%20opportunity/gettyimages-1144228456-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:00:19.108019

More than 75% of Duke Energy customers in the region now benefit from this technology.
This room would be completely full of people working to dispatch crews and restore power,"" McCord said.
McCord said Duke Energy continues investing in grid improvements, including pole and line upgrades, capacity additions and expanding smart technology deployment.
""Duke Energy is always investing to improve the grid reliability for our customers,"" McCord said.","HARRISON, Ohio — When winter weather strikes — or really, any major storm — and power lines go down, utility crews spring into action across southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky. But behind every field repair is a sophisticated operation most customers never see: Duke Energy's Midwest Power Distribution Control Center in Harrison.

The state-of-the-art, 140,000 square foot facility serves as the brain of the electrical grid, where dozens of operators work around the clock to manage power distribution for 800,000 customers across Ohio and Kentucky.

""This facility is responsible for managing all the technology out on the grid,"" said Joshua McCord, director of operations for Duke Energy Distribution Control Centers Midwest.

The control center, which opened in 2021, represents a dramatic shift from the utility industry's past. Gone are the days when customers had to call to report outages and crews had to patrol entire sections of power lines to find problems.

""We had no visibility into the system. It was just poles and wires,"" McCord said.

Now, advanced technology allows operators to pinpoint outages and dispatch crews to specific locations. Smart devices installed throughout the grid communicate directly with the control center, providing real-time information about system conditions.

WATCH: Go behind-the-scenes in the power distribution control center

Duke Energy says smart grid technology prevented nearly 400K outages this year

Self-healing technology

One of the center's newest tools is called ""self-healing technology"" — a system that automatically reroutes electricity when problems occur, similar to how GPS navigation finds alternate routes around traffic.

When a car hits a power pole or a tree falls on lines, McCord said the technology can instantly detect the problem and redirect power around the damaged area. What might have left 1,800 customers without power now affects only 250 customers, who experience brief flickers as the system switches power sources, McCord said.

""Those customers would have seen a blink. And so that's the lights flashing sometimes, sometimes once or twice or three times,"" McCord said.

This year alone, the self-healing technology has prevented nearly 400,000 customer outages in Ohio and Kentucky, saving nearly 1.4 million hours of total outage time, according to Duke Energy. More than 75% of Duke Energy customers in the region now benefit from this technology.

McCord said the impact becomes clear when comparing today's capabilities to past storms. During Hurricane Ike in 2008, some customers went without power for over a week. The self-healing technology didn't exist then.

""The improvements that we've made since that time would have an impact on restoration, because of those self-healing teams, because of the electronic devices we're putting out on the system,"" he said. ""There would be situations that occurred then where customers were out for a long duration that they may only see a blink in today's time with all the self-healing equipment that we have out there.""

Operators manage the grid 24/7

The control center operates with a demanding schedule. Thirty operators rotate through 12-hour shifts, working every day of the year.

During severe weather events, the facility becomes a hub of intense activity, McCord said. Ice storms pose particular challenges, as ice accumulation on power lines and trees can cause widespread outages. Wind, thunderstorms and lightning also create significant problems for the electrical grid.

""If there was a major icing event, we would experience outages. This room would be completely full of people working to dispatch crews and restore power,"" McCord said.

Even during routine cold spells, operators stay busy managing system loads as customers increase their electricity usage for heating, hot water and lighting.

The operators undergo extensive training — a rigorous two-year program followed by annual continuing education requirements to maintain their certification to operate the grid safely.

Technology and humans working together

While artificial intelligence may play a larger role in grid operations in the future, McCord said that human oversight remains essential, especially for safety-critical decisions involving high-voltage equipment.

""My personal hope is that we always see people in the room,"" McCord said. ""We have a lot of high voltages; it can be hazardous work, and so making sure our crew's safety is paramount.""

The Harrison facility is one of five distribution control centers Duke Energy operates across its service territory, which includes locations in St. Petersburg, Florida; Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina; and Plainfield, Indiana.

McCord said Duke Energy continues investing in grid improvements, including pole and line upgrades, capacity additions and expanding smart technology deployment.

""Duke Energy is always investing to improve the grid reliability for our customers,"" McCord said. ""The customer is number one. Every single person in this room is focused on the fact that they know a customer is without power, and they treat it with that level of sincerity and that level of criticality.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/88008e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3538x1857+0+68/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Fa9%2Fb37dad944e039859e3ff9174863b%2Fscreenshot-2025-12-16-at-4-53-06-pm.png,N,,2025-12-17 17:04:56.962982

T1 chairman and CEO Dan Barcelo said today that both deals, and the production of cells at the G2 Austin facility, would help deliver an “integrated US polysilicon solar supply chain”.
“Solar is the most scalable, reliable, and low-cost energy available today, and I look forward to the future of American solar running through Rockdale, Texas,” added Barcelo.
However, the lack of clarity on the Section 232 ruling has left many unanswered questions for the US solar manufacturing sector, particularly for polysilicon, as US module manufacturing capacity has grown much faster than polysilicon manufacturing capacity.
For their part, T1’s partners expressed optimism today that the deals put in place with the company would help deliver a robust US solar supply chain.","Cells will be used in the construction of modules at T1’s G1 Dallas module manufacturing plant, which the company acquired from Trina Solar last December as part of its rebrand from Freyr Battery and its move from the battery sector to the solar manufacturing industry.

The company has already seen significant demand for its modules—selling 725MW of modules in the third quarter of this year, driving sales volume of US$200-210 million—and the addition of cell manufacturing will expand a production line that makes heavy use of US-based manufacturing.

In August, T1 signed a supply deal with US ceramics and glass producer Corning to acquire polysilicon and wafers from the company and its subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor, from a manufacturing facility in Michigan. Then, in October, the company signed a deal to acquire steel module frames from US tracker manufacturer NEXTPower, then known as Nextracker, for use in its modules. T1 chairman and CEO Dan Barcelo said today that both deals, and the production of cells at the G2 Austin facility, would help deliver an “integrated US polysilicon solar supply chain”.

“Solar is the most scalable, reliable, and low-cost energy available today, and I look forward to the future of American solar running through Rockdale, Texas,” added Barcelo.

Building a domestic supply chain

The milestone is an important development for the US solar manufacturing industry, which has sought to bring online more capacity, particularly of wafers and cells, in recent months. T1 praised the Trump administration’s “pro-growth economic and trade policies”, likely referring to the wave of tariffs placed on imported goods and investigations into imports from Chinese-backed firms in an effort to stimulate domestic manufacturing.

This sentiment echoes comments made by T1 in July, when it said that the Department of Commerce’s (DOC’s) Section 232 investigation into polysilicon imports “will result in strengthening US energy security and boosting American advanced manufacturing”, by determining how polysilicon imports to the US should be affected by tariffs and other trade policies.

However, the lack of clarity on the Section 232 ruling has left many unanswered questions for the US solar manufacturing sector, particularly for polysilicon, as US module manufacturing capacity has grown much faster than polysilicon manufacturing capacity. Figures from Solar Media Market Research show that, by the end of 2025, the US is expected to lack 18GW of domestic polysilicon manufacturing capacity to meet its annual module manufacturing capacity, creating a gap that would have to be plugged by foreign imports, exactly the kind of imports that would be targeted by a strict Section 232 ruling.

For their part, T1’s partners expressed optimism today that the deals put in place with the company would help deliver a robust US solar supply chain.

“Corning is proud to supply G2 Austin with wafers that will power the next chapter in American-made solar technology,” said AB Ghosh, vice-president of solar at Corning, chairman and CEO of Hemlock Semiconductor.

“This is exactly the kind of investment in technology we hope to see continue in the US,” added Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of NEXTPower.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/t1-energy.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:01:24.306313

A new report projects that home heating costs will rise by 9.2 percent this winter, with colder temperatures and increasing energy prices playing a role.

The report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), which represents state governments in securing federal funding, projects that households will spend $995 on heating this winter, an increase of $84 from last winter. Costs for households using electric and natural gas heaters will increase by 12.2 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively.

The Hill has reached out to the Department of Energy for comment.

The projected increases significantly outpace the overall rate of inflation, which hit 3 percent in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). That same month, energy costs were up 2.8 percent relative to 12 months prior, while electricity and natural gas prices were up 5.1 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively.

The BLS will release inflation data for November on Thursday, after not collecting it for October due to the 43-day government shutdown.

The NEADA also noted in its report that an average monthly electric bill has increased by 29.2 percent since 2021, while natural gas prices have risen by nearly 50 percent over the past year.

“These increases may not sound dramatic to higher-income households, but for families already struggling, they are devastating,” NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe said in the report. “Millions of households are being pushed deeper into utility debt and closer to shutoffs simply because they cannot afford to keep their homes warm.”

Meanwhile, Congress has allocated $4 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), down from $6.1 billion in 2023. In the report, the NEADA called on the legislative branch to increase funding for the LIHEAP to prior levels and invest in grid modernization and clean energy sources.

Utility prices will likely play a key role in the 2026 midterms, after Democratic candidates in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City pledged to tackle the cost of living en route to victory in November.

President Trump campaigned on tackling inflation, including with regard to energy prices, throughout the 2024 campaign. But amid growing affordability concerns from Americans, including his own supporters, the president began a domestic tour in Pennsylvania last week to tout his administration’s work to lower costs.

The project represents a up to $10 billion investment in Phase I, including Hut 8’s investment in data center infrastructure.

At the peak of construction on Phase I, Hut 8 anticipates approximately 1,000 construction workers on-site. Once operational, Phase I of the River Bend campus is expected to create at least 75 direct new jobs with employment expected to expand significantly as future phases of the campus are developed. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 193 indirect new jobs, for a total of 268 potential new job opportunities in the Capital Region.

“Louisiana continues to win,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “Hut 8’s investment in River Bend builds on our track record of attracting global-scale projects in the industries of the future. As the campus grows, it will further cement Louisiana’s position as a national leader in energy and innovation, creating thousands of jobs and reaffirming our ability to compete and win on the global stage.”

Fluidstack, supported by a financial backstop from Google covering all lease and related pass-through obligations, will be a tenant at the site, which has the potential to scale to up to 1,000 MW of utility capacity, and positions Louisiana as a long-term hub for high-performance computing infrastructure.

“River Bend is a testament to the power of partnership,” Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said. “This project was made possible by the leadership of state and local leaders, the commitment of Entergy, and the determination of the people of Louisiana. Together, we will build infrastructure that supports the world’s most advanced technological applications at scale while setting a standard for how utilities, governments, and innovators can drive lasting economic and technological progress.”

Hut 8 tapped Entergy Louisiana to provide an initial 330 megawatts (MW) of utility capacity to support 245 MW of critical IT load for Fluidstack, a leading AI cloud platform for training and inference. This agreement was contemplated in Entergy’s more recent outlooks provided in November 2025.

“Energy is one of Louisiana’s greatest competitive advantages,” President and CEO of Entergy Louisiana Phillip May said. “Our ability to deliver reliable, scalable power while maintaining some of the lowest electricity rates in the country gives companies like Hut 8 the confidence to invest here, fueling economic growth and creating long-term value for our customers and communities.”

The State of Louisiana has positioned itself as a premier destination for global-scale projects like River Bend through a competitive portfolio of incentive programs. Hut 8 is expected to participate in Louisiana’s state and local sales and use tax rebate on qualifying purchases or leases of data center equipment, established in Act 730 of the 2024 Regular Legislative Session. Hut 8 also plans to participate in the state’s Quality Jobs program.

“River Bend demonstrates that Louisiana’s economic strategy is taking our state from plans to progress,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “This project will generate high-wage jobs and create pathways for Louisianans to build long-term careers in the industries of the future. It’s a clear example of how aligning policy, partnership and people translates into lasting opportunity.”

Construction on the data center is already underway with operations expected to commence by the second quarter of 2027.

“West Feliciana Parish is proud to welcome Hut 8 and River Bend to our community,” said Parish President Kenny Havard. “This is a once-in-a-generation project that will bring jobs, opportunity, and investment to our parish for decades to come. It shows what’s possible when local, state, and industry partners work together toward a shared vision of growth and progress.”

Hut 8’s River Bend campus builds on Louisiana’s momentum of landmark economic development projects over the past year that have reshaped the state’s economy and strengthening its global competitiveness. In the past year, Louisiana has secured milestone investments including Meta’s $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana and Hyundai Steel Company’s nearly $6 billion investment to establish its first North American manufacturing facility in Donaldsonville.

“We’re pleased to see Hut 8 reach this milestone in the Capital Region,” President and CEO of the Greater Baton Rouge Economic Partnership Lori Melancon said. “This is a great win for West Feliciana Parish, and it reflects the continued momentum across the Capital Region as a strong place for new and growing industries.”

Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie said of the report, “Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong.","Notably, Wisconsin installed 210MW over Q2 and Q3. In October, Wisconsin utility Alliant Energy integrated its first 100MW/400MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), next to a 200MW solar project in Grant County.

In July, Wisconsin regulators approved a 20MW/200MWh long-duration energy storage (LDES) project by Energy Dome and Alliant Energy.

In Q3 2025, community-scale, commercial, and industrial (CCI) storage was predominantly in California, which accounted for 54% of installations. Illinois also became a significant market, representing 4% of deployments.

Residential storage installations increased by 8% quarter-over-quarter, led by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates reached new peaks and larger capacity systems gained market share.

Puerto Rico experienced the highest quarter-over-quarter growth in installations, mainly due to high retail power prices and ongoing demand for resiliency. Meanwhile, North Carolina and Arizona achieved record quarterly installation levels in Q3 2025, influenced by the PowerPair Programme and decreasing solar export rates, respectively.

Forecasted installations

ACP and Wood Mackenzie forecast that 92.9GW/317.9GWh of storage will be installed in the US over the next five years, driven by project economics and policy incentives.

The utility-scale storage five-year forecast has grown by 15% following the passage of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ (‘OBBBA’), which, during its lengthy negotiations, had initially led Wood Mackenzie to lower its expectations. In the Q2 edition of the report, published just a few days before the legislation passed for final debate in the Senate, the research firm estimated that, had the bill eliminated tax credits for energy storage, it could have led to a 29% fall in utility-scale deployments in 2026.

Deployment is fuelled by ongoing access to the investment tax credit (ITC), competitive domestic cell manufacturing costs, merchant revenue opportunities, state policies, and load growth.

Wood Mackenzie anticipates the C&I storage market will reach an additional 892MW between 2025 and 2029 as programmes like California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) 3.0, and Illinois’ rebate initiatives mature, alongside expanding wholesale market access.

Federal policy changes

The US utility-scale storage market is expected to shrink by 11% in 2026 and 8% in 2027 year-over-year as supply chains adapt and domestic manufacturing increases.

However, it is projected to bounce back in 2028 and 2029 with double-digit year-over-year growth once domestic cell supply becomes more accessible. In the Q3 edition of the report, Wood Mackenzie had said that, although demand remained strong, the OBBBA and global trade uncertainty could still lead to a 10% year-over-year fall in utility-scale installations in 2027.

Responses in distributed storage show mixed results. The CCI segment will continue steady growth despite federal restrictions, mainly because deployments are focused in California, Massachusetts, New York, and Illinois, which offer significant state incentives.

Meanwhile, the residential storage sector is predicted to decline by 6% in 2026 due to the removal of Section 25D ITC, with residential solar facing an even sharper drop of 18%.

Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie said of the report, “Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong. Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-82.png,N,,2025-12-17 11:02:40.253881

About NRDC NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists.","WASHINGTON STATE – With the prospect of people across the country losing out on the benefits from cleaner transportation, today, Sierra Club, Climate Solutions, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), and Earthjustice filed a new challenge to the Trump administration’s hold on $2.5 billion in federal funding through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program.

The federal government had awarded more than 140 charging grants totaling nearly $1.8 billion to local and state agencies and tribes to fund crucial community charging and transportation corridor projects. However, the Trump administration froze the vast majority of these funds, meaning neither funds under those grants nor new grants have been moving forward. As a result, the transportation projects across the country promised by this program are in jeopardy, and more people will be harmed by pollution from extracting, transporting and burning gasoline to power vehicles with internal combustion engines.

These charging grants have a particular emphasis on reducing emissions from the transportation sector, a big source of air pollution. In addition to contributing to the climate crisis, pollution from burning fossil fuels to power vehicles creates major public health threats for millions of Americans and especially dangerous for marginalized communities across the nation that often live next to major freight corridors due to the history of redlining. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are harmed by vehicle pollution every year.

The groups’ lawsuit follows a lawsuit filed earlier today by 16 states and the District of Columbia in federal court for the Western District of Washington. Led by California, Colorado, and Washington, other states filing include Arizona, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

QUOTES FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF FILING ORGANIZATIONS:

“We’re suing to unlock clean energy infrastructure funds that have been promised to communities for cleaner vehicles, cleaner air, and good jobs. If this Congress-approved money isn’t used, it disappears—exactly what the Trump administration is hoping will happen. We won’t let the Trump administration sit on it any longer,” said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Zachary Fabish.

“This program will cut emissions, improve mobility, and expand charging access, especially in the communities that need it most. This unlawful freeze has stalled projects that local governments and tribes have already planned for and invested in. The longer it goes on, the more projects that are at risk. The administration must end this unlawful hold and release the funds that Congress mandated on a bipartisan basis,"" said Beth Hammon, a senior advocate at NRDC.

“Washington drivers want clean, fast and affordable ways to get around. This funding being unlawfully blocked by the Trump administration should be helping power up and connect rural communities across our state from Mount Vernon and Port Angeles to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. Threatening the funding for these promised projects is an attempt to delay Washington's progress while we are stuck paying the price through higher costs and more pollution,” said James Hove, Washington Director at Climate Solutions.

“People want and deserve access to reliable electric vehicle charging, and it’s egregious that the administration is taking us backwards. The impacts of the Trump administration's reckless decision to freeze funds already allocated by Congress are stark. Without dollars flowing to modernize our infrastructure, Americans will continue to live with polluted air and an outdated system stuck in the early 2000s,” said Marvin C. Brown IV, senior attorney at Earthjustice.

Additional Background:

The CFI program was created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which appropriated $2.5 billion for the program over five years. It represents one of two major federal funding programs for critical electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the other being the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program.

In May, our organizations (alongside others) filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful freeze of the NEVI program, a transformative, $5 billion national initiative to build electric vehicle charging stations along major highway corridors and to enable long-distance EV travel across the country.

In that lawsuit, a federal judge issued a preliminary order directing the federal government to release NEVI funding, and the Trump administration responded by beginning to restart the program in August.

The utility said combining Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas will “unlock more than $1 billion in net system savings to customers,” though the final amount could vary.
The University of Massachusetts Amherst’s analysis of 2022 data ranked Duke Energy as the nation’s third-largest carbon emitter.
Instead, Duke Energy plans to slowly merge existing rate schedules over multiple rate cases until both current service territories pay the same rates.
That new analysis projected potential savings of approximately $2.3 billion from 2027-2040,” Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton wrote in a written statement to WFAE.","Duke Energy has begun the process of fully combining its two service territories, a dozen years after Duke Energy merged with Progress Energy. This week, state regulators hosted public hearings on the utility’s proposal.

The utility said combining Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas will “unlock more than $1 billion in net system savings to customers,” though the final amount could vary. Duke provided a written statement to WFAE that these savings would result from “planning and execution for future resources and operational efficiencies.”

Tuesday night, two members of the public testified before state regulators during a virtual public hearing. Asheville-based Rachel Cohen commented on Duke’s pending rate hike proposal, a separate case.

“Raising rates for customers now, on the cusp of a deal that should lower Duke’s costs and increase profits for shareholders, doesn’t make a lot of sense for me, and I think it’s a bad deal for ratepayers,” Cohen said.

Cohen proposed holding off on any rate hikes until after January 2027, when the business combination would be complete.

Duke Energy filed a proposal to raise rates for all customers in November. The proposed rate hikes would increase Duke Energy’s revenues by over $1.7 billion.

Raleigh-based Gary Smith, chair of the North Carolina Council of Churches, said the group urged Duke Energy to increase its environmental commitments as part of the combination. He encouraged Duke to adopt, as company policy, the original interim carbon-pollution reduction target, which would require the utility to lower carbon emissions to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030.

“Summers here have become hotter, ocean levels continue to rise and storms have become more severe,” Smith said. “All of these are making life more difficult for North Carolinians.”

Burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of human-caused climate change, which scientists have linked to rising temperatures, elevated sea levels and worsening storms. The University of Massachusetts Amherst’s analysis of 2022 data ranked Duke Energy as the nation’s third-largest carbon emitter.

The combination would take effect Jan. 1, 2027. It would not impact the current rate case proceedings, in which Duke Energy is requesting the following adjustments to rates:

Residential rates for DEC customers would increase 11.9% in 2027 and 4% in 2028.

Residential rates for DEP customers would increase 14.1% in 2027 and 3.5% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEC customers would increase 8.7% in 2027 and 3.9% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEP customers would increase 9.2% in 2027 and 4.6% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEC customers would increase 6.3% in 2027 and 3.4% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEP customers would increase 7.4% in 2027 and 4.3% in 2028.

Instead, Duke Energy plans to slowly merge existing rate schedules over multiple rate cases until both current service territories pay the same rates.

The more than 50-year-old facility – Washington state’s last remaining coal plant – was slated for conversion to natural gas, under a long-standing agreement between the state of Washington and the plant’s owner.

DOE’s latest mandate, issued late Tuesday, follows orders issued earlier this year forcing the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in Michigan and the Eddystone oil-and-gas plant in Pennsylvania to stay open past their retirement dates, which public interest groups have challenged. DOE has repeatedly extended the emergency orders for both plants, despite evidence that both plants are unreliable, highly-polluting facilities, and are not necessary to meet near or long-term energy needs. Financial filings show that the Campbell plant alone racked up $80 million in net losses – over $600,000 every day during the months of June through the end of September. Those costs are being recovered from households and businesses across 11 states in the Midwest, even though the regional grid had more than enough electric power over that period.

“Once again, the Trump administration is upending state and local decisions to force an aging, costly, polluting coal plant to stay open,” said Ted Kelly, Director and Lead Counsel for U.S. Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund.

“Like we’ve seen with the Michigan coal plant, it’s households and businesses that end up paying out of pocket to keep these old, uneconomic plants on life support. It’s completely unnecessary, since years and years went into carefully planning the retirement of Washington’s last coal plant and shifting the grid to cleaner, more affordable power sources.

“Unfortunately, households and businesses across the region can expect higher electricity bills and more asthma-causing pollution in the new year.”

Antonio Busalacchi, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), which manages NCAR, said in a statement: “We are aware of reports that the Trump administration is proposing to break up the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research. … We do not have additional information about any such plan.”

Busalacchi added that the center’s research “is crucial for building American prosperity by protecting lives and property, supporting the economy, and strengthening national security. Any plans to dismantle NSF NCAR would set back our nation’s ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to severe weather and other natural disasters.”

NCAR’s research includes climate science. It also seeks to predict severe weather, model flooding, forecast air quality and look into how the sun’s behavior impacts life on Earth.

It also provides tools not just used by government research, but also outside scientists. According to its website, NCAR’s scientists collaborate with those in academia, government and the private sector. This includes the use of open-source models.

Instead, Duke Energy plans to slowly merge existing rate schedules over multiple rate cases until both current service territories pay the same rates.

This week, state regulators hosted public hearings on the utility’s proposal.

The utility said combining Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas will “unlock more than $1 billion in net system savings to customers,” though the final amount could vary. Duke provided a written statement to WFAE that these savings would result from “planning and execution for future resources and operational efficiencies.”

Tuesday night, two members of the public testified before state regulators during a virtual public hearing. Asheville-based Rachel Cohen commented on Duke’s pending rate hike proposal, a separate case.

“Raising rates for customers now, on the cusp of a deal that should lower Duke’s costs and increase profits for shareholders, doesn’t make a lot of sense for me, and I think it’s a bad deal for ratepayers,” Cohen said.

Cohen proposed holding off on any rate hikes until after January 2027, when the business combination would be complete.

Duke Energy filed a proposal to raise rates for all customers in November. The proposed rate hikes would increase Duke Energy’s revenues by over $1.7 billion.

Raleigh-based Gary Smith, chair of the North Carolina Council of Churches, said the group urged Duke Energy to increase its environmental commitments as part of the combination. He encouraged Duke to adopt, as company policy, the original interim carbon-pollution reduction target, which would require the utility to lower carbon emissions to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030.

“Summers here have become hotter, ocean levels continue to rise and storms have become more severe,” Smith said. “All of these are making life more difficult for North Carolinians.”

Burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of human-caused climate change, which scientists have linked to rising temperatures, elevated sea levels and worsening storms. The University of Massachusetts Amherst’s analysis of 2022 data ranked Duke Energy as the nation’s third-largest carbon emitter.

The combination would take effect Jan. 1, 2027. It would not impact the current rate case proceedings, in which Duke Energy is requesting the following adjustments to rates:

Residential rates for DEC customers would increase 11.9% in 2027 and 4% in 2028.

Residential rates for DEP customers would increase 14.1% in 2027 and 3.5% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEC customers would increase 8.7% in 2027 and 3.9% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEP customers would increase 9.2% in 2027 and 4.6% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEC customers would increase 6.3% in 2027 and 3.4% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEP customers would increase 7.4% in 2027 and 4.3% in 2028.

Read more about the partnership.

Federal tax incentives for clean energy upgrades are going away at the end of this year, cutting into potential savings on rooftop solar, heat pumps and more.

In 2026, homeowners who install a heat pump will no longer be able to apply for federal tax credits amounting to 30% off installation costs or new equipment.

At the same time, a pilot program from Central Maine Power that charged a lower rate in the winter to certain customers with heat pumps is also set to expire.

This means that homeowners may see costs associated with installing and running a heat pump go up next year, particularly as electricity rates continue to climb. Maine’s average electricity prices increased at the third highest rate in the country over the last decade, a previous analysis by The Maine Monitor found.

The federal energy efficiency tax credits, established under Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, are set to expire earlier than planned because of changes made this summer in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Federal home energy rebates for low- and moderate-income families, however, will remain in place.

Efficiency Maine Trust, the quasi-state agency responsible for energy programs, plans to continue offering several types of heat pump rebates, including up to $9,000 for low-income customers and up to $3,000 for any income level.

Efficiency Maine has no plans to modify its heat pump incentives when the federal tax credits expire, according to Executive Director Michael Stoddard. Funding for the heat pump rebates comes from a variety of sources, including electric utilities, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act and a grant from the federal Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Other efforts to increase heat pump adoption and make them more affordable are underway.

Maine is part of a five-state coalition called the New England Heat Pump Accelerator, a $450 million effort that launched last month to get more heat pumps installed by offering financial incentives to distributors and contractors; supporting new pilot programs and workforce development efforts; and improving educational outreach. The accelerator was funded with money from the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program created by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Maine surpassed Gov. Janet Mills’s goal to install 100,000 heat pumps by 2025 back in 2023. Now the state is working toward installing 275,000 units by 2027.

Maine Won’t Wait, the state’s climate action plan, tallied 143,000 heat pumps installed at the end of 2024. Rebates, combined with energy bill savings, have made heat pumps a popular alternative to heating systems that use oil, gas or propane.

Whereas traditional heating systems can only turn on and off, a heat pump can ramp up and down, said Shawn LaPlante, co-owner of LaPlante Home Services in Scarborough.

“It can use a little bit of electricity. It can use a lot of electricity when it needs it, and then it can go back down to a little bit of electricity. So it has the ability to vary,” LaPlante said.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, as The Maine Monitor has previously reported, cost savings associated with heat pumps have become a key part of the sales pitch. The clean energy think tank RMI calculated that, in Maine, a household can expect an average of $700 in energy bill savings annually after switching from delivered fuel to a heat pump.

Ryan Shea is the manager of RMI’s buildings team, which focuses on research and policies related to reducing carbon emissions and boosting efficiency. Shea said the annual cost savings calculations were made using RMI’s Green Upgrade Calculator, which factors in details about a given home, such as its size and when it was built, as well as energy rates, heat pump type and climate.

“There really is a lot that goes into quantifying energy bills, especially when you’re switching fuels,” Shea said. “What this tool tries to do is factor in all of those inputs and generate an output that’s quite accurate.”

When stacked against the cost of installation, LaPlante said most customers can expect to make back their initial investment in five to eight years, depending on their circumstances. LaPlante said there’s been a “slight uptick” in the number of customers looking to install heat pumps since the change was announced to the federal tax credits.

“This just gave them a little push to say, well, why not, because I can get the federal tax credit,” LaPlante said. “It’s an extra $2,000 potentially, so I think that allowed them to push up their timeline, but they had to have already been thinking about it.”",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/Climate-Heat-Pump-Announcement.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-17 13:01:06.424137

Well, technically, it has been there since Trump took office. This is a weird period in automotive history; A chunk of the industry is full-steam ahead with EV development, another is cutting back, and the consumer is left wondering what the electrification landscape will look like next year, let alone in three, during the next administration.

But what about the automotive aftermarket? Typically, this corner benefits from whatever progress is made on the OEM front—have Trump’s policies expanded or contracted its EV technological development? I recently spent some time chatting with personnel of the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) at its yearly tradeshow in Las Vegas to find out. I also hit the bricks (or, rather, bright carpeting) of the massive show itself, seeking out some new, unique developments in the space that behoove EV tech’s inherent benefits.

Above one of the show’s several sprawling halls, I met with Mike Spagnola, SEMA’s CEO, and Karen Bailey-Chapman, senior vice president, public and government affairs, to learn what the organization’s official stance is. First and foremost: It doesn’t want to be told what to do.

Trump-like talking points

“Thirty-three percent of our industry would’ve been wiped out had EV mandates continued,” Bailey-Chapman said, referring to future federal fuel efficiency regulations that would have required automakers to sell many more EVs to avoid punishing fines. Those efficiency targets were just ripped up by the Trump administration.

“The reality is that we embrace EVs, we embrace all technologies. If it moves on wheels, we’re good… but what we are against is that we have to choose this, and that’s it,” she said.

She claimed that over the past couple of years, SEMA has become more political than ever before, advocating heavily for what it finds to be the best way forward for its members. Part of that includes limiting the power of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which was given the power to regulate California’s air quality after decades of smog affected the Los Angeles basin.

“We’re not against EVs; we just think that all technology should move forward,” Spagnola added. “We’re environmentally respectful—we do a lot of work with CARB and the EPA—but we think technology should move forward, and you should have a choice of what you drive.” Indeed, SEMA has an emissions lab in Diamond Bar, California, to help its member companies create a wide range of products that meet stringent CARB-level requirements.

On one hand, not giving American consumers the choice is counter to how our economy functions, and it limits technological progress. If there are benefits to be found, they typically are found no matter what, especially in the name of horsepower, chassis development, and so on. But on the other hand, stricter guidelines also breed innovation. Increasing emissions and fuel economy standards have gotten us to a level of internal combustion technology that we could have only dreamed of 30 years ago. Who’s to say the same wouldn’t happen with stricter requirements for electrification?

Talking about torque

After speaking with Spagnola and Bailey-Chapman, I ventured over to SEMA’s FutureTech Studio, where a handful of EV-centric companies were highlighted. Two immediately piqued my interest.

The first was Sierra, a company that specializes in customizable single-seater off-road chassis, including its assemble-it-yourself Echo, which uses an EV powertrain. The benefits of an EV powertrain are immediately noticeable in its packaging. The motor and battery sit far inboard from the rear axle, and due to their compact overall combined dimension, give it small dimensions that would be hard to match with any engine, transmission, and fuel tank.

But the real benefits are found elsewhere. “The biggest thing is torque application,” a company representative told me. “When you’re in off-road racing, going through whoops [and other trail features], I can get all the torque out of that motor instantaneously.” He also highlighted that there are just four moving parts instead of around 400 in an internal combustion-powered rig, so durability is less of a concern. To keep temperatures in check, it sports an active cooling system that flows glycol through the motor and high-velocity fans for the electronics. The application is intended for short-course desert racing that’s less than 200 miles (321 km), in addition to just going for a rip in the dirt.

Classic car top hats?

The next company made me reminisce about my freshman-year science class in the early ’00s, when I first learned that EVs could one day have skateboard chassis. Meaning, there would be a basic chassis that you could swap different bodies between. Elkington Motors of Provo, Utah, follows a similar concept: bolt a classic muscle car (particularly any gen-one Ford Mustang) or truck body onto a ready-to-go chassis.

The specs are appealing: 90 kWh battery, 508 hp (379 kW), 2,212 lb-ft (3,000 Nm), all-wheel drive, and around 220 miles (354 km) of range. All chassis, suspension, and accompanying electronics to make it work are part of the build. Even in the sea of shoulder-to-shoulder attendees, it was apparent how well-thought-out and beneficial this sort of EV conversion could be, especially to the intrepid DIYer.

Has aftermarket EV tech and development stalled in the wake of increased fuel efficiency and other clean vehicle regulations being off the table? It may be that all the advancements over the past decade have matured enough for the sector to take the basic concepts and run. The benefits are apparent (packaging, output potential, chassis engineering, fascinating traction control tuning, etc.), and there’s clearly enough work still being done to create some new and exciting developments.

But I also can’t help but think that progress may be slowed, at least here in the US. Less investment on the OEM side means less for the technologically talented among us to say “I can do that better,” a cornerstone of the aftermarket industry. Remember when turbocharging took F1 by storm in the ’70s and ’80s? It not only helped form the basis of what forced induction is today, but it also made for one of the series’ most fascinating eras. It would be a shame if we miss out on that on the EV front.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SEMAPhotos20251-1152x648.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:00:31.391502

Let's hope this money can get flowing again so our EV infrastructure can be built up to where it needs to be.
If an issue is detected, battery charging will be disabled, the company said, at which point the battery will be replaced.","Good morning! It's Wednesday, December 17, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, a fairly sizable chunk of U.S. states are suing the federal government over President Trump's decision to suspend two EV charging programs that would have helped with infrastructure, the European Union has officially proposed killing off its 2035 combustion-engine ban, Scout Motors will be allowed to sell directly to customers in Colorado and Jeep is asking for forgiveness following 4xe recalls.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are suing the federal government in response to President Trump's decision to suspend two grant programs for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the President's Department of Transportation has refused to approve any new funding under two EV charging infrastructure programs created by Congress. They were part of the $1 trillion infrastructure law signed by former-President Biden in 2022.

This latest lawsuit is being led by the attorneys general of California and Colorado, but it has been joined by AGs from Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as the governor of Pennsylvania.

Back in June, a U.S. judge actually blocked Trump's plan to withhold funding awarded to 14 states from a seperate $5 billion electric vehicle charger infrastructure fund that was approved in 2022, so there's some precedent here. From Reuters:

""This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,"" Bonta said.

One of the programs directs $2.5 billion in funding to states and cities for EV charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The suit, led by California, Washington and Colorado, said Trump's action ""has placed $1.8 billion in federal awards to dozens of state and local governments in jeopardy and made the vast majority of these funds unavailable.""

[...]

Trump has taken aim at electric vehicles on a number of fronts. In June, the Republican president signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California's landmark plan to end sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 and two other vehicle rules.

Trump has also —rather infamously — signed legislation that killed the $7,500 EV tax credit, and earlier this month, he proposed slashing fuel economy standards the Biden Administration finalized last year. It's all part of an effort to make it easier for American automakers to sell gas-powered cars.

Let's hope this money can get flowing again so our EV infrastructure can be built up to where it needs to be. And, before you all start complaining about subsidies for the EV industry, ask yourself what sort of subsidies the oil and gas industry is getting.

The European Union is trashing its 2035 combustion engine ban after receiving a hell of a lot of pressure from the automotive industry, which has struggled to really make EVs catch on as quickly as it had hoped. Now, rather than requiring automakers to completely eliminate carbon-dioxide tailpipe emissions for new cars starting in 2035, the EU's new proposal calls for a 90% reduction from a baseline level. That remaining 10% would need to be made up through the use of low-carbon steel or from e-fuels and bio-diesel.

The European Commission said its plan maintains a strong market signal in favor of zero-emission vehicles while also giving automakers a bit more flexibility. It basically means that, along with full EVs and hydrogen vehicles, car companies can also sell plug-in hybrids, extended range electric vehicles and even some internal combustion-powered cars past the 2035 deadline.

At the moment, it's still just a proposal. It'll need to gain approval from the EU's member states and the European Parliament before it can become law. From The Wall Street Journal:

Industry groups said the proposal was a positive first step but raised questions about the details. The measures ""are too complex"" and won't be enough to protect production and jobs, the European Association of Automotive Suppliers said.

Carmakers had argued that the original 2035 target for zero emissions was unachievable because of a slower-than-expected uptake of EVs among consumers.

[...]

In Europe, automakers have had to price their EVs aggressively to hit regulatory targets this year, resulting in a surge in sales but weaker profits.

Volkswagen, for example, reported a loss for the third quarter. The region's largest carmaker said it sold more lower-margin EVs while its Porsche brand was hit by write-downs related to EV investments that hadn't yielded the expected returns.

Europe's vast complex of automotive suppliers is being particularly hard hit by the transition. EVs contain fewer of the mechanical parts the companies specialize in and more electronics, where Asian supply chains are dominant.

Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen—two of Europe's largest automotive suppliers—announced thousands of job cuts in recent months. A study by consulting company Roland Berger for the European Association of Automotive Suppliers found that as many as 350,000 jobs could be lost by 2030 if the current trend continues.

Obviously, I cannot see the future, but I've got a terrible feeling that in a few years, we're going to look back at these decisions being made by governments in the U.S. and Europe and be able to point to exactly where it all went wrong. We're going to be able to see exactly where tailpipe emissions got out of control, once and for all. Hopefully I'm wrong.

Scout Motors has wanted to do direct-to-customer sales from the get-go, and that hasn't really gone over so well with dealers. Still, it hasn't stopped the Volkswagen-owned SUV-maker from getting its dealer license in Colorado, which means it can indeed sell cars directly to buyers in the U.S.

Colorado's Motor Vehicle Dealer Board voted 6-2 to approve Scount's application to become a dealer in the state. As you may have imagined, dealers aren't thrilled about this development, and I'll tell you what: I don't give a rat's ass. From Automotive News:

""We're disappointed,"" Colorado Auto Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves told Automotive News. ""We have a law that specifically prohibits manufacturers from having control of the dealership and now the state's just granted a manufacturer control of the dealership.""

Scout's detailed roadmap to sell an electric SUV and pickup to American consumers includes experience centers, speedy purchase transactions, stores in key U.S. markets and a flexible nationwide service footprint at launch.

Denver was one of the first 25 markets Scout identified for brand-owned rooftops in October 2024.

Groves acknowledged that there is a loophole for Tesla, Rivian and Lucid to sell vehicles in Colorado because those are all-EV brands and do not have franchise agreements with legacy automakers.

Groves said Scout is financially backed by VW Group and plans to offer an extended-range EV energy system which will utilize a gasoline engine as a generator.

[...]

VW Group, VW Group of America and Scout maintain the startup is and will remain independent.

Right now, it's not clear how many locations Scout is planning to set up in Colorado or if it was granted licenses in other states as well, but we do know that its Colorado license is valid from December 16, 2025, through October 31, 2026. It'll allow the automaker to sell new, used and wholesale vehicles.

In a rare (and slightly strange) move, Jeep's CEO apologized and promised a $100 gift card in a note to 4xe plug-in hybrid owners who have been dealing with a slew of issues related to three separate battery fire recalls in the past two years.

CEO Bob Broderdorf said most Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe hybrids haven't been impacted by the battery problems, but he acknowledged recalls could be ""unsettling."" He asked owners of these troubled cars to ""Please accept our sincerest apologies."" Most recently, 320,065 owners were told to stop charging their 4xes and park them away from structures. From The Detroit News:

""As a valued member of the Jeep family, you deserve a reassuring ownership experience, and we are truly sorry if this situation caused any disappointment or concern,"" the email said. The brand is offering $100 Mastercard gift cards to ""cover unexpected fuel costs since you are being asked to not travel in EV mode,"" the CEO confirmed, while also providing loaner vehicles and extended warranties for the Samsung SDI-made high-voltage batteries.

The apology came as the Stellantis NV brand also released details to dealers for how to fix the Wrangler plug-in hybrids, though not yet the Grand Cherokee versions, after the battery recall was issued in late October. Owners began to book repairs on Tuesday.

The fix, as with the prior two Jeep battery recalls, doesn't involve immediately replacing the battery. Instead, it involves a software update that is supposed to be able to detect if there is damage in a battery component called a separator. If an issue is detected, battery charging will be disabled, the company said, at which point the battery will be replaced.

The company in a recent statement said it now has a ""deeper understanding of the factors involved"" and has found a ""more comprehensive remedy"" to fix it.

Aside from the latest ""park away from structures"" recall, the others involved a software update causing some 4xe drivers to suddenly lose power, as well as a really bizarre one that we told you about: sand in the engine that could cause a fire.

This is nothing a $100 gift card can't fix.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/federal-government-sued-by-16-states-over-trumps-decision-to-pull-ev-charger-programs/l-intro-1765984132.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:30.039851

The development could become one of Europe's first fully-integrated operations to produce lithium while also generating renewable energy.

The agreement involves a package of three contracts valued at over US$50m under which ABB is responsible for delivering the project's entire electrical infrastructure.

This remit includes powering Vulcan’s Lithium Extraction Plant in Landau, the Central Lithium Plant in Industriepark Höchst, near Frankfurt, and the surrounding well sites.

ABB will manage the full electrical scope of the project, from the high-voltage grid connection, down to building-level processes, ensuring a consistent and reliable power supply for the facility's operations.

Strategic partnership for EV supply chain

The partnership between Vulcan Energy and ABB could serve as a model for integrating clean energy production with advanced electrification.

Björn Jonsson Global Business Line Manager for Mining & Materials at ABB explained the project’s broader implications: “The Lionheart Project is a blueprint for how clean energy and advanced electrification go hand in hand.

“We are building the foundations for a stronger European battery supply chain, helping to meet growing demand for electric vehicles at a crucial point in the transition to clean mobility.”

The Lionheart Project is set to produce 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) each year. This refined lithium is a key component in battery manufacturing and the facility's output is projected to be sufficient to power approximately 500,000 electric vehicles annually.

Vulcan's integrated approach combines this lithium extraction with the generation of 275 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity and 560 GWh of heat contributing to both its industrial needs and wider clean energy objectives.

Offtake agreements and project funding

The facility’s integrated nature means Vulcan can supply lithium and renewable energy from a single location, which may offer a more sustainable option for downstream manufacturers in the battery supply chain.

Vulcan has secured ten-year offtake agreements to supply lithium from 2028 to major firms including Stellantis, LG Corp, Umicore and Glencore.

Speaking to Reuters, Francis Wedin, Executive Chair of Vulcan Energy, said construction was now fully funded and set to begin immediately. He confirmed the project would take two-and-a-half years with full-scale operations expected once commissioning is complete.

The project is supported by a multi-layered financing package of US$2.56bn combining equity grants and debt. The financing is backed by 13 institutions including the European Investment Bank, five export credit agencies and seven commercial banks.

WASHINGTON (P&GJ) — Environmental and consumer advocacy groups warned this week that continued growth in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports could drive higher energy costs for domestic consumers, citing new analysis and recent court action involving a proposed Louisiana export terminal.

During a media briefing, representatives from Sierra Club and Public Citizen pointed to a Louisiana state court decision that vacated a coastal use permit for Commonwealth LNG’s proposed export facility, as well as the state regulator’s subsequent reissuance of the permit. The briefing coincided with the release of a long-anticipated report from Public Citizen examining the inflationary impact of expanding LNG exports.

Eric Huber, managing attorney with Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said the court ruling hinged on a lack of environmental justice and climate analysis. “The judge vacated the Commonwealth permit because it didn’t consider environmental justice or climate change, but instead of a good faith effort to fix it, the state agency re-issued the same permit with no changes and no public participation, basically doubling down on its prior conclusions,” Huber said. “We are planning to file a new lawsuit as early as Thursday, December 18th.”

Opponents initially viewed the ruling as a setback for LNG expansion, but noted that Louisiana regulators moved quickly to reinstate the permit. Panelists also criticized what they described as broader federal support for LNG development, citing backing from the administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Department of Energy. In November, the U.S. House passed legislation aimed at limiting federal oversight of LNG expansion.

Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, argued that rising export volumes are already affecting domestic gas markets. “Eight LNG export terminals now consume more natural gas than all 74 million households with gas utility service,” Slocum said. “Twenty-five percent of all US gas production is now headed for export.”

Slocum added that export growth has translated into higher costs for consumers. “These record exports are causing an affordability crisis for American families,” he said. “American households have paid $12 billion in higher natural gas prices since Trump took office, amounting to $124 more per family.”

According to Public Citizen’s report, increasing LNG export volumes removes gas supply from the domestic market, contributing to higher prices for residential, commercial, and industrial users. The analysis also argues that higher gas prices could raise electricity costs, as gas-fired generation continues to account for a growing share of U.S. power supply.

Panelists concluded that while LNG export capacity continues to expand, policy and legal avenues remain available for communities seeking to limit or delay projects they believe could increase energy costs.

An effort to scale nuclear energy serves as a complement — not a substitute — for ambitious reforms that address near-term deployment barriers directly.","The New York State Energy Planning Board on Tuesday approved the latest State Energy Plan, a critical update to the roadmap guiding New York toward its nation-leading climate goals. Within the modeling undergirding it is an important finding. For the first time, New York explicitly evaluated nuclear power in its power system modeling and found that adding new nuclear energy would make it easier and less expensive for the state to meet its 2040 clean energy target.

This conclusion comes at a pivotal moment. The same modeling, conducted by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, acknowledges that New York is likely to miss its ambitious 2030 emissions reduction targets. While disappointing, the outcome reflects the scale of the challenge rather than a lack of effort. The state has reduced power-sector emissions by 43% from 1990 levels and launched crucial efforts including a Clean Energy Standard, siting and transmission reforms, the Coordinated Grid Planning Process, major offshore wind projects and the Build Public Renewables Act. The question now is whether the state will apply lessons from its own analysis as it looks ahead to 2040.

NYSERDA’s modeling makes a compelling case that nuclear power can deliver meaningful system-wide benefits. Across five scenarios and multiple variants that model different amounts of new nuclear that could be built by 2040 — anywhere from 2.2 GW to 4.4 GW — the cost-minimizing model consistently chose to max out new nuclear capacity built in New York. Even at the lower end, adding 2.2 GW of new nuclear power decreases the total costs of achieving the 2040 targets by an estimated $26 billion. That’s $26 billion saved from the pockets of ratepayers and taxpayers. It also significantly reduces the amount of infrastructure the state would need to build to achieve its targets, lowering the total required generation and storage capacity by about 11 GW by 2040 and 23 GW by 2050, which is equivalent to one-third and two-thirds of the peak demand in the state today, respectively.

These results may surprise some, as the technology’s levelized cost of electricity is higher compared to onshore wind or utility-scale solar. But NYSERDA’s assumptions about nuclear costs are relatively balanced, ranging from $11,600/kW to $12,400/kW up to 2035 with declining costs after. These assumptions are more conservative than a recent study by MIT that estimated lower new nuclear build costs. But what the levelized cost of energy metric does not capture is the value nuclear resources provide the electricity grid beyond the electricity they generate.

Nuclear energy’s large impact lies in its ability to provide zero-carbon, firm and dispatchable power. In a power system reliant mostly on intermittent renewable sources, nuclear’s ability to operate 24/7 can offset an outsized amount of other capacity. By building nuclear plants for baseload energy, we can forego building the most expensive, marginal intermittent resources for peak demand and focus on the fastest, least expensive renewables to pair with that nuclear baseload.

While new nuclear capacity reduces the total amount of capacity the state needs to build to achieve targets, the modeling in the state’s plans still underscores the need for renewables, storage and transmission to scale at warp speed. With or without nuclear energy, the plan makes clear that there cannot be any excuses or delays in accelerating clean energy and storage deployment. An effort to scale nuclear energy serves as a complement — not a substitute — for ambitious reforms that address near-term deployment barriers directly.

In fact, nuclear energy’s potential benefits are dependent on new transmission. In one scenario that developed 3.3 GW of new nuclear, 1 GW of additional transmission was needed from upstate to deliver the nuclear electrons to downstate load. This further underscores that transmission bottlenecks between upstate and downstate constrain New York under any mix of generating resources. Building this transmission capacity is critical for every viable decarbonization scenario.

Of course, running a power system model is relatively easy compared to scaling a new nuclear supply chain and overcoming nuclear financing challenges. While New York’s recent 1 GW goal and the development of a nuclear roadmap are a good start, more will be needed for the state to realize its vision. The state must quickly establish an energy program that will procure new nuclear — establishing mechanisms to manage project development risks, public financing mechanisms to lower the financial hurdles and interest costs, and leveraging its co-leadership in organizations like the National Association of State Energy Officials’ Advanced Nuclear First Movers Initiative for new nuclear development.

Ultimately, New York’s new energy plan sends an important signal: Deep decarbonization requires not just ambition, but technological inclusion. NYSERDA’s analysis clearly shows that nuclear energy can play a valuable role in the solution, and now state leaders must show the resolve to act on this and other lessons from the Energy Plan.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ceyBvnUEzllo2cVVtQ4Pqk8FQshk4nviVHxQdo0Wftc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjMyNjA5ODY3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-17 11:01:12.358397

Communities leading the way for clean air Communities across the South need clean air.","When we work together, we make a difference. Look at all we did in 2025.

This year, across the South, we worked together in the face of unprecedented attacks on our environment.

And while the challenges were daunting, something even stronger carried us forward: our shared commitment to make a difference here at home.

Alongside our supporters and partner organizations across the South we’ve worked together to protect the places we love, defend the communities too often overlooked, and safeguard the healthy environment every one of us depends on.

Together, we fought back against the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle our bedrock environmental protections, held polluters accountable, and worked to protect clean air, clean water, a stable climate, thriving wildlife, accessible public lands, and a healthier future.

With your support, we’re holding the line and even made progress as the White House paves the way for polluters. You were with us in the courtroom, in the halls of government, and in the communities we serve.

Taking on the Trump Administration

The Trump administration is doing everything they can to unravel the bedrock laws that keep our air breathable, our water safe to drink, and our public lands protected.

The consequence of this administration’s attempts to dismantle federal protections is being felt in our everyday lives. And over the past year, we stepped up because no one voted for dirty air or dirty water.

From filing litigation over funding to cuts for climate and environmental justice federal programs to organizing advocates to speak out on gutting safeguards for public lands, we stood up together and pushed back against the threats against our environment.

Safeguarding the waters we rely on

Clean water is one of our region’s most essential resources.

This year further demonstrated just how quickly it can be put at risk. Communities across the South are facing dangerous threats to their drinking water, from toxic industrial chemicals to leaking coal ash pits and outdated infrastructure that jeopardizes the health of our families. But when our clean water is threatened, people respond. And we are working with them.

Across the region, residents, local partners, and advocacy groups are demanding transparency, accountability, and stronger protections for our rivers, lakes, and the drinking water sources they rely on every day.

That was especially clear from North Carolina, where 900,000 downstream residents learned their drinking water was being contaminated by a cancer-causing industrial chemical from the town of Asheboro. And from Alabama where SELC secured a settlement to help address Tuscaloosa’s chronic sewage spills into Hurricane Creek.

Plantations to Pollution: confronting history, protecting communities

History isn’t behind us; it’s under our feet.

This year, SELC deepened its work to connect the South’s past to the pollution and policy failures still harming communities today. With more than 100 active environmental justice matters, our attorneys and advocates are enforcing the laws that safeguard clean air and water for communities of color across the region. Through Plantations to Pollution: Black Communities, Legacy Pollution, and the Path Forward, we traced the often-unbroken line from plantation slavery to modern environmental injustices — while spotlighting the people demanding fairness, accountability, and a healthier future. Because what was built on injustice still demands justice.

Communities leading the way for clean air

Communities across the South need clean air. This year, we deepened our work alongside residents, partner organizations, and local leaders to strengthen air protections at a time when state and federal oversight is increasingly strained. From training community members in Birmingham to identify and report air pollution to confronting new threats from rapidly expanding industries like data centers and landfills that could worsen air quality for already overburdened communities.

While the Trump administration is granting exemptions for some of our country’s most dangerous air polluters, SELC continues to push for transparency, enforce the Clean Air Act, and demand that decision-makers evaluate the health and economic consequences of pollution.

While the federal government may try to erase any mention of environmental justice, it cannot silence the voices of those living with the impacts.

Defending our climate future

Climate change continues to intensify across the South, but this year showed the strength of communities working to build a healthier, more resilient future. In rural Virginia, residents successfully stopped a massive methane gas plant proposed to fuel a sprawling data center complex. This is a clear reminder that local voices can shape the region’s energy future. We also challenged the Trump administration’s attempt to halt funding for electric vehicle infrastructure which would stall critical progress need to shift drivers toward cleaner options.

Across the region, we pushed for policies that address the South’s high energy burden, ensuring families aren’t forced to choose between keeping the lights on and meeting basic needs. And along the Gulf, we stood with local residents and commercial fishermen facing the rising impacts of the methane export boom that is having devastating impacts on these coastal communities’ health, livelihoods, and culture.

Protecting the wild places and wildlife we love

The South’s public lands and wildlife are among our region’s greatest treasures, and this year brought important progress toward safeguarding the places and species that define us.

In South Carolina, we helped protect an ancient swamp forest from a proposed power line expansion that would have cut through one of the state’s most ecologically significant landscapes. Along the coast, we secured protections for the fragile bird sanctuary at Lake Mattamuskeet, stopping a toxic chemical experiment that could have threatened migratory birds and the surrounding ecosystem.

Red wolves, the most endangered population in the world, saw renewed momentum after years of decline, thanks to ongoing legal pressure and strengthened commitments to recovery. And in Georgia, the Okefenokee Swamp took a major step toward lasting protection, marking a turning point for one of the South’s most iconic wild places.

A hopeful close to a hard year.

This year tested our environment, our region, and many of us personally. Yet through every challenge, one truth held steady: When we work together, we make progress.

You proved that it is possible even in the toughest of times. You reminded us that hope isn’t something we simply feel — it’s something we do. Hope is filing suit when communities and places are threatened. It’s showing up to public hearings. It’s supporting our work financially and through advocacy, refusing to accept that pollution is inevitable or acceptable.

Thank you for working with us. For believing in a better future for the South and taking action, day after day, to make it real. Thank you for working alongside us. Thank you for believing in the power and promise of this place and our organization.

For immediate expensing of research and experimental expenditures under § 174A, Federal Tax Coordinator 2d ¶ L-3075.","Baker Tilly experts outlined key tax strategies for individuals and businesses navigating changes enacted by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Panelists at a December 11 webinar hosted by the firm offered advice on strategic planning, compliance, and financial modeling in the wake of the new law, which permanently extended several existing provisions while introducing new credits and deductions.

Enacted in July 2025, the OBBBA makes many of the individual and business tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent, preventing a scheduled reversion to higher pre-TCJA rates.

For businesses, the Act restores and makes permanent several key provisions, most notably the immediate expensing for domestic research and experimental (R&E) expenditures and 100% bonus depreciation. However, the legislation also scales back some of the clean energy incentives established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), especially for wind and solar projects.

Proactive Strategic Planning

The Baker Tilly panel, comprised of experts in the firm’s credits and incentives and financial advisory practices, emphasized that taxpayers must engage in early and comprehensive strategic planning to maximize benefits. This is especially true for state and local incentives, which often require action before a project is publicly announced.

Director Gabriel Sermeno noted that businesses considering relocating a facility to a different state can trigger several incentives, such as those for “new equipment, new buildings,” and “infrastructure improvement.” But companies should allot “at least three” months “at the bare minimum, if not six or more” for reaching out to states as part of a thorough location analysis.

“It’s important to get ahead of that and make sure that we’re not calling them the day before we’re going to put a shovel in the ground, because they’re going to be less inclined to provide incentives to a project that they feel has already made a decision,” Sermeno said. He advised creating an internal project team with representatives from finance, tax, human resources, and the C-suite, to ensure incentive eligibility.

This proactive stance is also critical for federal credits. Senior Manager Colin Quill reminded taxpayers of the tight timelines for new clean energy credits. Phaseouts of solar and wind credits in particular were “really accelerated, he explained,” as developers “have to begin construction … before July 4, 2026.” Facilities should be placed in service by January 1, 2028.

For businesses involved in manufacturing, Managing Director Jarrid McAuliff recommended planning around the new qualified production property (QPP) rules, which allow for accelerated depreciation. “[P]roperty that would otherwise be required to be depreciated over 39 years for tax purposes could be fully expensed in Year One, to the extent that it is integral and directly related to manufacturing or production process that meets certain requirements,” McAuliff stated.

He cautioned, however, that this “integral part test” specifically excludes ancillary areas like offices, restrooms, and lobbies.

Compliance Risks

With new opportunities come new compliance risks, and the panel warned that the IRS is increasing its enforcement efforts. The transferability of federal tax credits, a feature of the recent IRA and modified by the new law, is a key concern. Quill warned that while the IRS registration portal verifies a project’s existence, there is no “certification by the IRS as to the value of the credits or the amount,” meaning “there’s still that audit risk on the back end after you transfer them and then claim.”

This risk is compounded by new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules. Quill affirmed that taxpayers should “go down your supply chain [and] look at where your manufacturing material is coming from.”

“If it’s coming from an entity that’s directly tied to China, North Korea, Russia or Iran, that’s an issue,” which “could cause you to not get a credit at all,” Quill added.

Thorough documentation is the primary defense, the panel emphasized. For businesses claiming QPP expensing, McAuliff recommended conducting an “engineering-based cost segregation study to safely identify those parts of the building, components of the building, that are deemed integral and necessary for the production process.”

Modeling State and Federal Impacts

The experts advised that taxpayers must model the financial impact of various state and federal incentives to optimize their tax strategy. Managing Director Brad Elmer shared a case study of a $35 million historic redevelopment project in Kansas City where a holistic approach yielded substantial benefits.

“About half of it was financed through some type of credit or incentive,” he said, citing a combination of federal and state historic tax credits, a state brownfield credit, new markets tax credits, and a local property tax abatement. But he cautioned that the value of incentives varies by jurisdiction and timing, making detailed financial modeling crucial.

The interplay between federal and state rules also requires careful analysis, the panel agreed. Discussing the new rules for IRC § 174A, which allows for immediate expensing of domestic R&E, Director Diana Walker observed that not all states conform to the federal changes.

“[Y]ou also need to look into that and see what impact you could have there,” Walker advised. “For some states, you may still need to do [IRC § 174] analysis on the domestic side.”

Small businesses “should gather your documentation to support that you meet the requirement to be considered a small business under the OBBBA,” she continued. “And finally, make sure that you get with your tax advisor and plan for your return.”

The funds include an approved loan of $347 million from the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program and selection of Fort Worth to receive $4,817,344 million from the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) grant program.

Fort Worth’s WIFIA loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse. A newly designed and built water reclamation facility will meet the needs of a growing population while treating wastewater to be reused for industrial and irrigation purposes. The SWIFR grant will help launch the Reuse Program and Recycling Enhancement Project to collect appliances, building materials, furniture, and electronics for reuse at drop-off locations.

Fort Worth’s WIFIA loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse

“Fort Worth’s growth has made it a premier destination in Texas for families and businesses, and has created a greater need for clean water infrastructure and materials management services,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “Funding from EPA can help this great city increase capacity to meet those needs and continue the historic pace of growth.”

“Fort Worth is committed to making smart, future-focused investments that keep our city strong and affordable for the families and businesses who call it home,” said Mayor Mattie Parker. “The EPA’s WIFIA loan for the Mary’s Creek Water Reclamation Facility allows us to stretch every dollar by securing low interest rates and flexible repayment terms. The solid waste grant helps us expand the reuse and recycling services our community relies on. Together, these investments are a major win for our wastewater and solid waste ratepayers and reinforce our commitment to delivering high-quality, cost-effective services as Fort Worth continues to grow.”

The WIFIA program aims to accelerate investment in the nation’s water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental credit assistance for regionally and nationally significant projects. Through its flexible financing features and competitive interest rates, WIFIA helps communities save money. By pairing the WIFIA program’s federal funding with state, local, and private investment, EPA accelerates water infrastructure investment worth billions of dollars.

The WIFIA program’s rolling selection process allows a wide variety of borrowers from across the country to access WIFIA financing. For example, in the last round of funding, the WIFIA program selected two private entities and five small communities to submit loan applications. To date, EPA’s WIFIA program has announced $22 billion to help finance over 140 projects across the country. These projects are creating over 160,000 jobs across the country.

EPA’s SWIFR program provides grants to improve post-consumer materials management and infrastructure; support improvements to local post-consumer materials management and recycling programs; and assist local waste management authorities in making improvements to local waste management systems.

From apples to grapes, MSU research covered the full beverage aisle this year.","From a new presidential administration and consequential tariffs to devastating wildfires and a new comet, to pop culture news and continued international conflict, faculty experts at Michigan State University offered thoughtful, research-based commentary to provide insight and context on these events.

MSU researchers continued to make breakthroughs and discoveries this year despite unprecedented federal research terminations, which present major implications to both Americans and people across the world.

As Michigan State University ranked as a top 50 global research university this year, the institution is often featured in the media for its research prowess, major discoveries and scientific breakthroughs. MSU faculty prioritize engaging media with the goal of advancing public knowledge and fact-sharing to support more informed decision-making and policy funding, as well as to combat misinformation and disinformation, both of which are on the rise.

Take a look at some of our top research and story placements as well as expert commentary in national, statewide and local media throughout 2025.

2025: When politics overpowered science

In 2025, the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, initiative became one of the year’s most contentious public health stories as federal leaders reshaped the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and rolled back established vaccine guidance while researchers warned that these changes frequently relied on flawed or nonexistent science. Even highly visible actions like phasing out synthetic food dyes drew criticism for lacking scientific rigor and relying on voluntary compliance.

When the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a $500 million budget cut for the research and production of vaccines based on mRNA technologies and changed its vaccine guidelines, MSU’s Rebecca Schein, a pediatric infectious disease physician in the College of Human Medicine, shared her knowledge about what people should know and how to prepare for these changes. Schein spoke with several media outlets, including writing an article about measles in The Conversation.

But the biggest shock to the scientific community came when the National Institutes of Health announced sweeping cuts to major grant programs — reductions that significantly impacted universities, hospitals and research institutes nationwide. Long-standing projects in cancer, neuroscience, infectious disease, maternal health and environmental health all saw sudden freezes or eliminations, leaving scientists scrambling to maintain labs, staff and clinical studies.

At MSU, faculty raised alarms about the immediate fallout: paused trials, disrupted student training pipelines and delays in life-saving research. Experts emphasized that these cuts don’t just affect universities — they slow medical progress, weaken the national research workforce and ultimately impact patients who rely on new diagnostics, treatments and public health breakthroughs.

Dawn Misra, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the College of Human Medicine, was halfway through a study on infant mortality among Detroit mothers when it was canceled and shared her experience with The New Yorker and The Detroit News.

Cara Poland, associate professor at the College of Human Medicine, who runs a drug treatment clinic, testified about the drastic cuts to opioid prevention. Other scholars, such as Red Cedar Distinguished Professor Natoshia Cunningham, authored op-eds about how the impact of program cuts, even abroad, will negatively affect Americans.

Jeffrey MacKeigan, a professor at the College of Human Medicine, submitted an article to The Conversation about how there is literally no replacement for government-funded cancer research.

But while national health policy drifted toward ideology, MSU’s faculty members have remained committed to providing public health guidance grounded in data and science-based breakthroughs like the research that led to the discovery of cisplatin, which continues to save lives after nearly 50 years.

One of MSU’s most celebrated moments in 2025 was the national recognition of cisplatin — the groundbreaking cancer drug discovered through MSU-led research. In 1965, a group of Michigan State University researchers discovered it while working on an unrelated chemistry project. Since then, cisplatin has become the industry standard for cancer-fighting chemotherapy treatments. In September 2025, MSU received a Golden Goose Award for the scientific success and global impact of cisplatin. The Golden Goose Award is meant to highlight the practical value of curiosity-driven research. The idea is that fundamental research can lead to unexpected, but profound, societal benefits.

Cancer is everywhere, unfortunately. From understanding the origins of cancer to engineering precision therapies, MSU scientists continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the fight against this disease. In September 2025, researchers at Michigan State University unveiled an innovative hydrogel with the consistency of shampoo that may help protect hair from falling out during chemotherapy. Designed to be applied before and kept on during treatment, the gel offers a potentially accessible, lower-impact approach to preserving patients’ appearance and dignity in what is often a difficult time.

In January, MSU Research Foundation Professor Teresa Woodruff joined one of the most exclusive circles in American science when former President Joe Biden awarded her the National Medal of Science — the nation’s highest honor for scientific achievement. Woodruff, the first Spartan ever to receive the medal, was recognized for groundbreaking contributions to reproductive biology, cancer research and the creation of an entirely new scientific field: oncofertility, which bridges oncology and reproductive health. As MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz said, “Her oncofertility research has given thousands of patients and their families hope for a better future.”

At MSU, we know that funding and research leads to ongoing discoveries. In 2020, Aitor Aguirre, associate professor and chief of the Division of Developmental and Stem Cell Biology in MSU’s Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering and his team started creating and perfecting tiny working models of the human heart known as organoids. His lab is now a pioneer and world leader in human heart organoid technologies. These organoids are truly mini hearts, complete with chamber-like structures and vascular networks including arteries, veins and capillaries. The team’s most recent development was to modify the organoids to replicate atrial fibrillation, or A-fib. This development will benefit an estimated 60 million people who have arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats. No new drugs have been introduced for this condition for more than 30 years because accurate models have not been available.

To solve real health problems like A-fib and strengthen Michigan’s leadership in science, health care and education, MSU will continue to look forward and prepare for what’s next. In 2025, MSU began to evaluate “One Team, One Health,” a major institutional shift that would integrate human, animal and environmental health in a way that would position MSU as a national leader. This new vision would benefit our students and the people of Michigan and beyond.

And in 2025, the College of Osteopathic Medicine celebrated an important milestone: becoming the first osteopathic medical school to be included in the prestigious National Institutes of Health Medical Scientist Training Program, or MSTP. This award officially recognizes MSU’s D.O.-Ph.D. Physician-Scientist Training Program as one of the top dual-degree programs in the U.S., elevating its influence in the biomedical research community. The MSTP is one of the most competitive medical education programs and provides funding and support for students pursuing dual medical and research degrees.

Tariffs hit ports and purses

From global markets to the grocery store, tariffs reshaped economic policy and conversation. The Trump administration announced “Liberation Day” on April 2, 2025, after imposing record-high global tariffs — importing controversy and exporting heated debate.

Jason Miller, Eli Broad Professor in Supply Chain Management at the Broad College of Business, not only published research on tariffs, but spoke with dozens of media, including ABC News, Bloomberg and Marketplace. These engagements helped land Miller to the state’s Commission for Logistics and Supply Chain Collaboration. As tariffs tested reactions, it tested legal questions. So Matthew Leffler, an adjunct professor at the MSU College of Law, commented about the legal debate amid the Supreme Court case, V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump.

Ports were not just affected but our pantries too. David Ortega, professor and Noel W. Stuckman Chair in Food Economics and Policy at the College of Agricultural and Natural Resources, discussed the impact on food prices and agriculture. Ortega was a key resource to localize the issue while being a go-to expert for numerous national outlets, including PBS, CBS and Reuters, to name a few. All this public engagement led Ortega to receive an award for his research communication in food economics and the opportunity to testify to lawmakers.

Beyond prices, the issue of tariffs created uncertainty about the overall impact to the economy. Reacting were Associate Professor Antonio Doblas-Madrid and Professor Emeritus Charles Ballard, economists at the College of Social Science, who discussed the impact to investments and how tariffs affected interest rates, respectively.

Stellar interstellar research and activity

Is it a bird? A plane? No, it’s the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS! And MSU’s own Darryl Seligman was on the team that discovered it and authored the first scientific paper on the icy traveler. It’s named 3I because it’s only the third interstellar object to enter our solar system. And ATLAS stands for NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, which consists of four telescopes — two in Hawaii, one in Chile and one in South Africa — that automatically scan the entire sky several times every night looking for moving objects. Seligman, assistant professor in the College of Natural Science, talked to media outlets around the globe, including NPR, CNN and the BBC, reaching over 1,000 articles since 3I/ATLAS was first discovered.

And a rare “planet parade” occurred Feb. 28, 2025, when seven planets — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — lined up in the night sky, offering a spectacular opportunity for sky watchers. MSU’s Shannon Schmoll, manager of MSU’s Abrams Planetarium, served as one of MSU’s most visible national experts, appearing in outlets like Newsweek and the Associated Press, discussing everything from planetary alignments to supermoons. She reached audiences across the country and reinforced MSU’s leadership in astronomy education and public science outreach.

When a black hole winks at you, should you wink back? Stephen DiKerby, a physics and astronomy research associate in the College of Natural Science, detected a rare X-ray “wink” from the supermassive black hole at the center of the Andromeda galaxy using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. By analyzing 15 years of telescope data, DiKerby and his collaborators uncovered previously unseen flares that shed new light on how galaxies and their black holes evolve. The discovery, published in The Astrophysical Journal and linked to ongoing neutrino research through the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, highlights the importance of sustaining high-resolution space telescopes like Chandra, which are critical tools for understanding the physics that shape our universe. Wink, wink!

Climate change: Turning up the heat and haze

It was another scorcher of a year, with expectations of 2025 coming in as the second or third hottest year on record. As temperatures climbed, so did conversations about all things weather. Discussing climate change was Wolfgang Bauer, University Distinguished Professor at the College of Natural Science, speaking with MSUToday and Yahoo. Tackling the big question of what can be done, Jeremy Orr, an adjunct professor at the College of Law, offered his insights in Crain’s Detroit Business.

The year was not just hot, it caught fire. The Palisades Fire blazed for weeks, becoming the most destructive wildfire in the history of Los Angeles. And the smoke in the west didn’t stay there. Michigan experienced fire-related haze from Canada, raising concerns about air quality for households, pets and wildlife alike. So, Robert Wahl, assistant professor at the College of Human Medicine, spoke to The New York Times and stations here in Michigan about how to mitigate health risk. To extinguish confusion, Chad Papa, director of the Forest Carbon and Climate Program, shed light on why fires occur to Bridge Michigan and the Detroit Free Press.

Another kind of fire started simmering, but underground: Mount Spur, a giant volcano in Alaska. The monitoring alerts went out on the heels of funding cuts. Professor Jeffrey Freymueller, professor and chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the College of Natural Science, spoke about the importance of geographic monitoring with CNN and The New York Times.

To cool things off, Michigan with its many miles of Great Lakes shoreline, saw water levels peak in 2020. As a result, Assistant Professor Ethan Theuerkauf at the College of Social Science has been studying the increase of shoreline protection efforts and environmental impacts and shared his findings with various outlets.

The year of the animals

This year was so full of creatures great and small that MSU practically needed its own ark. From fungi-loving dogs to butterflies on the brink, from cows moo-ving into their new digs, bees making headlines and veterinarians containing an avian flu outbreak — animals were at the center of some of MSU’s most meaningful stories.

In January, Gregory Bonito discovered two new species of truffles with some paw-fessional help by “truffle dogs.” Tuber canirevelatum, meaning the ‘dog-found’ truffle, was named in honor of all truffle dogs and Monza, the dog who discovered it with her trainer Lois Martin. The other, Tuber cumberlandense, was named for the Cumberland Plateau where it was found by Margaret Townsend and her truffle dog, Luca. Even fungi experts said the find provided mush-room for excitement. Food & Wine, Popular Science along with other outlets covered the story.

In July, MSU officially opened its massive new Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center, welcoming the first wave of cows into a facility designed to support cutting-edge animal science and student learning. At 165,000 square feet, the center gives dairy research space to grow — no more feeling udder-ly cramped. The transition from the 1960s barns to a modern operation signaled a major investment in animal welfare, agriculture and Michigan’s dairy future. The Associated Press was on hand to capture the story, which led to several other media hits as well.

In 2025, Maple, a retired police K-9, became one of MSU’s most unexpected research partners. At the Pollinator Performance Center, Maple helped demonstrate how trained dogs can quickly sniff out American foulbrood, a highly contagious disease that can devastate honeybee colonies if it goes undetected. The project highlights MSU’s creative, cross-disciplinary approach to protecting pollinators, strengthening agriculture and supporting beekeepers — all while reminding campus that sometimes big science breakthroughs come with wagging tails and a bee suit. The Associated Press, The Washington Post and several other outlets reported on Maple and MSU’s research partnership.

On a more serious note, a March study by MSU scientists raised the alarm that some countries could face the unthinkable: losing all native butterfly species if habitat loss and climate stress continue unchecked. The research, led by Elise Zipkin, director of MSU’s Ecology, Evolution and Behavior Program, and her MSU colleague and co-author Nick Haddad, professor of integrative biology in EEB, have been major figures in assessing the state of U.S. butterflies and highlighting the urgent need for conservation and better land-use protections before ecosystems reach a breaking point. In 2025, this study was catapulted into national conversation as a stark example of what is at stake as outlined in this article by The New York Times. Many other national outlets covered this startling news, including The Washington Post, Associated Press and Science Friday.

One of the year’s most significant stories was Michigan State University’s leadership in the national response to highly pathogenic avian influenza after the virus made an unprecedented jump into U.S. dairy cattle. With years of preparation already underway, MSU’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory — led at the time by Kimberly Dodd, who is now dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine — became one of the first labs in the country to detect the virus in milk and develop new diagnostic methods. In partnership with state and federal agencies, MSU helped launch the National Milk Testing Strategy, giving farmers and regulators an early-warning system that shaped the country’s response. MSU researchers and veterinarians were on farms within days collecting samples, guiding biosecurity and providing critical, science-based information to producers.

Their findings, including how long cattle shed the virus, how it affects milk production and why milk is the best sample for detection, informed national policy and helped Michigan become a model for rapid, coordinated response. As Dodd put it, the goal is to “detect the next COVID before it becomes a pandemic.” With the virus still circulating in wild birds, MSU scientists continue to track risks and support farmers, proving that when a threat won’t quit, neither will the teams working to stay ahead of it. The ABC News Medical Unit came to campus to help tell this important story.

Agriculture is in our DNA

MSU was founded as a pioneer agricultural college and has evolved over the last 170 years into a major land-grant research university devoted to agriculture, natural resources and beyond. Here’s some of our top agriculture research in 2025.

MSU researcher John A. Hannah Distinguished Professor Bruno Basso and his team made a big leap forward this year by improving how carbon markets work — systems that pay farmers and companies for practices that genuinely reduce greenhouse gases. The challenge is that these markets only work if the climate benefits are measured accurately, and most current methods rely on outdated assumptions. Basso’s group developed a new, science-backed way to show what would happen on farmland without any changes, making it much easier to tell whether practices like no-till or cover crops are truly helping the climate. Tested across 12 Midwestern states, the approach is simple enough to scale and gives farmers and businesses a clearer, more trustworthy foundation for investing in regenerative agriculture. Why does this matter? It helps ensure climate solutions are real and that farmers get credit for the work that actually makes a difference. This important story was covered in The New York Times.

Agriculture in space? Narendra Das, an associate professor in MSU’s College of Engineering, helped build a new tool for space, and farms here on Earth will benefit too. When the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar mission launched July 30, 2025, it carried MSU-developed technology that can map soil moisture from space at a fine scale (about 100–200 meters). That means farmers in Michigan, across the U.S. and around the world will be able to get up-to-date information on fields — even under clouds or at night — to help them decide when to plant, irrigate or harvest. The data could improve crop yields, boost food security and even help monitor drought or wildfire risk. MSU’s contribution puts farmer-friendly Earth science on the global radar. Media found this story out of this world.

And while MSU technology was soaring into space, MSU researchers Ben Belton, professor in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Leo Baldiga, a doctoral student in the College of Social Science, were helping transform what happens just a few feet above the ground. Modern agricultural drones that are now powerful enough to carry heavy loads like two sacks of fertilizer can also spray crops, plant seeds, map fields, monitor crop health and even help tend livestock. For farms large and small, that means more efficiency, less manual labor and far smarter, more precise farming. Together, MSU’s space-based sensors and down-to-earth drones show how the university is helping agriculture take off in every direction and the media liked the story.

And as drones were transforming how farmers work from the sky, MSU’s Anthony Kendall, an assistant professor in the College of Natural Science, was testing how solar panels on farmland could improve soil health, save water and support pollinators — all while giving farmers a new, steady income stream. Kendall’s team is using a $3.6 million National Science Foundation grant to build a first-of-its-kind outdoor lab to study how solar arrays interact with crops, groundwater and local ecosystems. The goal is to give farmers and communities clear, science-based guidance on when solar makes sense. Just yet another reason why funding research matters. Several media outlets picked up this bright story including Michigan Public radio.

Not all farm innovation comes from space or solar panels — some of it starts right in the barn. In October 2025, MSU research helped a Michigan dairy farm improve milk quality and cut feed costs by switching cows to a high-oleic soybean diet developed at MSU. The change boosted milk fat and protein while reducing the farm’s purchased feed expenses by about 20% each month. Why this matters: It shows how MSU science can strengthen farm profitability and sustainability at the same time, a subject of interest to various media outlets including Michigan Farm News.

Now here’s something to raise a glass to. From apples to grapes, MSU research covered the full beverage aisle this year. In vineyards across Michigan, Associate Professor Timothy Miles helped growers protect the state’s $6 billion grape industry by identifying the viruses that quietly drain yields — a big win for anyone who enjoys Michigan juice or wine, and the media agreed.

Meanwhile, deep in the woods, Professor Steve van Nocker and doctoral student Kaz Christian tracked down the last wild apple trees in Michigan, preserving rare genetics that could make future orchards more frost-tolerant. Together, MSU scientists kept the state’s fruit — and its cider, juice and wine — flowing smoothly. The Associated Press followed us in the woods for this story and other media reported on it as well.

AI, engineering and innovation

When the nation’s infrastructure made headlines, MSU experts made solutions. The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after being struck from a ship that lost signal. In response to safety concerns, Nizar Lajnef, professor at the College of Engineering, combined sensors and artificial intelligence to assess the health of infrastructure from bridges to dams to roads. He shared how this technology is going to benefit infrastructure in Michigan, including the Mackinac Bridge.

When discussing infrastructure innovation, it would be remiss not to bring up concrete. And speaking of concrete, did you know that it can bend and heal now? At least, it does at MSU. Assistant Professor Qingxu “Bill” Jin at the College of Engineering worked with his team to develop slabs of self-heating and self-healing concrete to improve road safety. Jin shared the success with almost every outlet in the state from Detroit to Grand Rapids to northern Michigan.

As physical innovations occurred, MSU researchers also examined digital innovation and AI running alongside it. Mohammad Ghassemi, assistant professor at the College of Education, discussed the reliability of AI, while David Markowitz, associate professor at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences, was not lying when it came to a study examining whether or not AI can detect lying. As conversations turned to regulation, Anjana Susarla, Omura-Saxena Professor in Responsible AI at the Broad College of Business, authored many commentaries in Forbes about policy and AI oversight.

The year in pop culture and sports

From the field to the screen, pop culture and sports took center stage. The Kansas City Chiefs came short of a historic three-peat Super Bowl. As the football slipped through hands, eyes shifted to the ads. Robert Kolt, professor of practice emeritus at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences, shared which ads scored and which ones missed, speaking with The State News and The Detroit News. Kendrick Lamar’s halftime performance, which set a record for most halftime viewers, stole the show. Analyzing how he struck a chord, Christina L. Myers, assistant professor at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences, shared her expertise in an article for The Conversation and in an interview about Lamar’s social and cultural impact.

Though Travis Kelce didn’t get another Super Bowl ring, he still managed to get another type of ring — an engagement ring for Taylor Swift, sending fans into a frenzy. The buzz did not remain online. Emily Muhich, assistant professor at the College of Social Science, took Taylor Swift to the classroom to teach concepts about pop culture, history and politics, which garnered media interest across mid-Michigan.

While Taylor Swift started in country music, Beyonce’s acclaimed country album and tour got fans talking in 2025, including the emergence of her daughter, Blue Ivy, as a burgeoning performer. Kinitra Brooks, professor and Leslie Endowed Chair in Literary Studies at the College of Arts and Letters, spoke to the Associated Press about her significance.

Fan bases also cheered on their sports teams. As the NFL saw many injuries this year, MSU President and John A. Hannah Distinguished Professor Kevin Guskiewicz discussed his concussion research and Matthew Harkey, assistant professor at the College of Education, shared research about how wireless ultrasounds can support on-field injuries.

Looking ahead to 2026, a different game of football got the world talking: the World Cup. MSU researchers are growing the grass for the competition’s 16 sites — and even launched a website ahead of the tournament. The team is led by Professor Trey Rogers at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, who has shared the success of the grassroots program with Michigan Farm News and outlets across the nation.

Diplomacy is not always diplomatic

Across borders and regions, tensions ensued throughout the year. October 7 marked two years since the Israel-Hamas conflict entered a new phase war. The release of the living hostages brought some resolution; however, stability in the region remains fragile. Russell Lucas, professor at James Madison College, not only discussed U.S. involvement but commented on the future of the Middle East to both U.S. think tanks and international media.

To the north, across the Black Sea, Russia’s war on Ukraine dragged on as the United States tried to be the peace broker. In reaction, Matthew Pauly, associate professor at the College of Social Science, spoke to Newsweek. At MSU’s campus, Pauly brought Ukrainian Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence Kseniia Borodin to teach students about Ukrainian language and history.

Geopolitical tensions also arose in unexpected places, such as Greenland, home to under 60,000 residents. However, the country occupied the headlines after President Trump floated the idea of annexation to the U.S., sparking strong reactions. Matt Zierler, associate professor at James Madison College, spoke with TheHill on the impact to global relations, while also commenting on the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico with Business Insider.

Immigration policy in the U.S. affected neighboring country relations and became a contentious issue as border security and deportations ramped up. Amid changing policies, Veronica Thronson, clinical professor of law and director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the MSU College of Law, commented on the executive orders and how the deportations could affect the workforce.

Touring Michigan the Spartan way

In May, MSU’s Spartan Bus Tour rolled through Detroit offering faculty and administrators a powerful two-day look at the city’s resilience, creativity and partnerships with the university. President Kevin Guskiewicz joined 60 Spartans at 14 stops across the region, including the Zekelman Holocaust Center, MSU Extension’s urban agriculture hub in northwest Detroit, neighborhood arts spaces, the Apple Developer Academy and the iconic Motown Museum. The stops highlighted how MSU’s work in education, health, mobility, the arts and economic development is deeply woven into Detroit’s story. Participants described the experience as inspiring and eye-opening, underscoring both the challenges Detroit faces and the innovation and strength that define the city today, as well as MSU’s responsibility to be a true partner in its continued growth. And the media, including WDET and the Michigan Chronicle, enjoyed the tour as well.

Then in October, a new group of MSU faculty and administrators traveled more than 1,100 miles across northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula on the fall Spartan Bus Tour — a rolling classroom designed to strengthen partnerships and spotlight MSU’s statewide impact. Over three days and 15 community stops, participants met with local leaders, health providers, artists, educators, tribal partners, researchers and alumni to learn firsthand how MSU’s work in rural health care, sustainable forestry, agriculture, education and economic development supports the region. From visiting community hospitals and wild rice restoration sites to touring maple syrup operations, mines, sports flooring manufacturers and local colleges, the tour emphasized MSU’s land-grant commitment to service, collaboration and listening. And UP media tagged along, as well, including to catch a surprise appearance by MSU basketball Head Coach Tom Izzo. As President Guskiewicz put it, after miles of meeting Michiganders where they are: “We have a responsibility as Michigan’s state university to serve its people through the work that we do at MSU. Times are tough, but we are Spartans — and we are built for this.”

Did you think we forgot about the Trump administration this year?

Since taking office this past January, the Trump administration has dominated the news — so we thought we would save it for last. You’re welcome. Within minutes after inauguration, President Trump signed over two dozen executive orders — and the actions did not stop. Matt Grossmann, professor at the College of Social Science, who was named a Carnegie Fellow in 2025, immediately began reacting to the orders and Trump’s first 100 days in office.

Trump’s actions prompted debate about executive power. Erica Frantz, associate professor at the College of Social Science, wrote an article for The Conversation and Jordan Cash, assistant professor at James Madison College was a frequent commentor. As the political climate intensified, the nation was stunned by political assassinations of elected officials and Charlie Kirk. Frantz spoke about the rise in political violence with Politico and the Wall Street Journal.

Despite it not being a general election year, there was still campaign buzz. Meghan Wilson, assistant professor at the College of Social Science, commented about the Detroit mayoral race with Michigan Public radio and authored articles on issues the city faces.

Other states held key gubernatorial and special elections, providing a first glimpse of 2026. Corwin Smidt, associate professor and interim director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, spoke about key issues such as health care to NPR and he previewed the major 2026 races in Michigan. Voters were also surveyed, including by Dante Chinni, director of the American Communities Project housed at the School of Journalism, who shared findings with The Associated Press.

What the Trump administration labeled as its government efficiency effort led to the loss of millions in research funding — including at MSU — and the university launched a Research for You campaign to show the value of funding research. In response, many faculty underscored the consequences to lost or revoked funding.

The federal government cut millions in USAID funding, resulting in losses for agricultural research. Dave Douches, professor at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, lost millions amid his research to engineer better potatoes to support food security, sharing the impact with MLive and CBS Detroit. Also from the college commenting about farm research loss was Professor David Tschirley, who spoke with Reuters and Fast Company, among other national outlets.

USAID cuts also affected public health. Robin Lin Miller, professor at the College of Social Science, authored pieces in The Detroit News and The Conversation on the U.S. retreat from trying to mitigate AIDS and HIV in Africa. These cuts also defunded education and engineering programs.

Researchers also discussed the impact of other federal programs and grant cancelations. Josh Cowen, professor at the College of Education, wrote many articles for The Conversation about Department of Education layoffs. Arts and humanities were affected too. Devon Akmon, director of the MSU Museum, wrote an article about the funding cuts to libraries and museums, and many researchers at MSU’s College of Arts and Letters shared the impact of their projects’ terminations.

To our surprise, some of these big issues found their way to the court room. One issue that could not scroll past the courts was the future of TikTok. Nancy Costello, clinical professor of law and director of the First Amendment Clinic, spoke with News Desk and Detroit media and continued to react to political speech issues.

Commenting on other Supreme Court cases were College of Law experts such as Frank Ravitch, professor of law and Walter H. Stowers Chair of Law and Religion, discussing cases on religion and schools with USA Today and Michigan Advance. There also were major cases on LGBTQ freedoms, so Heather Johnson, an adjunct professor of law, spoke with Bloomberg Law and localized the issues talking with Michigan stations.

But there were more legal woes. President Trump floated a potential third term, immediately raising constitutional questions. Brian Kalt, professor of law and Harold Norris Faculty Scholar, was everywhere commenting, not just on national television but in The Atlantic and The Hill. Pardon another topic, but presidential pardons also became a big issue. Not only was Kalt commenting, but also Quinn Yeargain, associate and 1855 Professor of the Law on Democracy, sitting down with PBS Detroit. Ahead of the midterms, redistricting battles began out of Texas, and Yeargain spoke with CNN. So, was this enough about politics?

The Trump administration may have dominated the news — but MSU experts dominated the reactions — providing research and fact-based explanation and insights.

Volkswagen AG and Rivian Automotive Inc. have ambitions of selling the electric vehicle technology they’re developing together to other carmakers in the future.

Their joint venture, known as RV Tech, said it has made solid progress on delivering the EV electrical and software platform that Volkswagen needs to compete with Tesla Inc. and Chinese rivals. The JV is focused on delivering models for Rivian and VW but is keeping communication open with third parties about the scalability of its platforms.

“We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry,” Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair, told journalists at an event in Palo Alto, California, in November. “That could become an opportunity” for others as well, he said.

Volkswagen is grappling with tariffs in the US, shrinking deliveries in China and muted demand in Europe. As part of its push to cut costs and bolster sales, it’s turning to Rivian for the kind of software and EV technology its initial battery-powered models were missing. The automaker is investing as much as $5.8 billion into the alliance, making it one of Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume’s biggest strategic bets.

The platform is designed to be scalable across vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets. The earnings potential from licensing the technology “is a very different ballgame,” Bensaid said, “and a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars.”

The venture plans to begin testing the system in winter conditions on Audi, VW and Scout models starting in the first quarter of 2026.

“There’s no Rivian versus VW versus Audi,” Bensaid said. “It’s Rivian and Audi and VW and potentially in the future other OEMs because of the breadth and scalability of the technology solution that we’re building.”

Like Tesla, BYD Co. and Xiaomi Corp., RV Tech is using zonal architecture, which requires fewer individual controllers to oversee a wider range of functions in the car’s front, central and rear sections. This reduces costs by cutting the number of computers and wiring needed.

Volkswagen has licensed its technology to other carmakers in the past, with Ford Motor Co. and Mahindra & Mahindra using the German carmaker’s first-generation platform for their own electric models.

The partners formed a joint venture one year ago that brings together software developers and engineers from both companies. They’re working with Rivian’s centralized electronics layout with fewer computing units that’s meant to help Volkswagen simplify development and cut costs. For loss-making Rivian, the investment is a financial lifeline as manufacturers rethink strategies in a slowing EV market.

While the JV is prioritizing the ramp-up and delivery of the underpinnings for electric models, there are parallels that would allow the technology to be used for combustion-engine cars as well, JV co-chair Carsten Helbing said.

The first car to get the new technology will be Rivian’s R2 sport utility vehicle, out early next year. VW’s compact EV, called ID. EVERY1, expected to cost around €20,000 (about $23,000), will follow in 2027, with rugged vehicles from the Scout brand due after that. Volkswagen has a similar partnership with Xpeng Inc. for the Chinese market.

Volkswagen’s earlier efforts to develop software in-house largely stumbled, first by holding up launches of its namesake brand’s ID models, then by handicapping those vehicles’ sales because of buggy features. The group, which also includes Audi and Porsche AG, has seen EV sales rise in Europe this year after improving software and updating models.

What the Regulated Community Should Know about the Draft Revisions ...,Not Available,,,,,https://www.clarkhill.com/news-events/news/whither-wotus-what-the-regulated-community-should-know-about-the-draft-revisions-to-the-wotus-rule/,"Public comments on the draft rule are due by Jan. 5, 2026.
Does the draft rule prevail in these twin challenges of clarity and finality?
• The draft rule has an exclusion for ditches “constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.” However, the preamble asserts that a ditch that connects to a jurisdictional tributary is not itself jurisdictional.
• The draft rule provides that jurisdiction over a tributary is severed by reaches of non-relatively permanent flow.
Regulated entities should engage regarding both the federal WOTUS rule and in state processes to ensure their concerns are heard.","The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of pollutants from a point source to navigable waters without a permit. (33 USC 1311). This makes interpreting “navigable waters” key because this term defines the jurisdictional bounds of the Clean Water Act. Yet, the Act simply defines “navigable waters” as “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” (33 USC 1362(7)). Thus began the decades-long saga of the “waters of the United States,” or “WOTUS,” defined through multiple agency rulemaking bouts and no fewer than four journeys to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In the latest chapter, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published draft revisions to the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” on Nov. 20, 2025. 90 Fed. Reg. 52498. This is the second revision to the rule in the two-and-a-half years since the Supreme Court in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency held that WOTUS is limited to relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, and wetlands with a continuous surface connection to such tributaries. 598 U.S. 651 (2023). Public comments on the draft rule are due by Jan. 5, 2026.

The draft revisions follow the saga’s first actual foray into rhyme, as the notice of intent to engage in the rulemaking was entitled, “WOTUS Notice: The Final Response to SCOTUS.” 90 Fed. Reg. 13428 (March 24, 2025). Consistent with the theme of finality, the draft rule’s purpose was to “clarify the scope of Federal jurisdiction” in light of Sackett. 90 Fed. Reg. 52499.

Does the draft rule prevail in these twin challenges of clarity and finality? Significant aspects of the draft rule include:

• The key concept from Sackett of “relatively permanent” is defined as surface water that has standing or flowing water year-round or at least during the “wet season.” Similarly, the definition of “continuous surface connection” means a wetland that abuts a jurisdictional water and has surface water at least during the “wet season.” However, “wet season” remains undefined.

• The draft rule has an exclusion for ditches “constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.” However, the preamble asserts that a ditch that connects to a jurisdictional tributary is not itself jurisdictional. It is unclear how a ditch constructed entirely in dry land could physically connect to a jurisdictional tributary.

• The draft rule provides that jurisdiction over a tributary is severed by reaches of non-relatively permanent flow. However, it also introduces an exception when the tributary is “part of a water transfer.”

Although “wet season” is not defined in the draft rule itself, its potential application is discussed at length in the Preamble. Importantly, the concept may be challenging to apply in the arid west. The preamble discusses the fact that the “wet season” may occur during runoff from melting snowpack. However, this could be difficult to apply in practice. For instance, in Colorado, many plains streams do not flow in response to snowpack runoff at all. In mountain streams, the snowpack runoff period may be measured in weeks rather than months, and the timing may be variable from year to year. And, in many arid west states, surface water may occur during summer monsoons, but the monsoon season is also highly variable from year-to-year in terms of precipitation amounts and timing.

Meanwhile, the states have not stood still in their responses to Sackett. In the period following the publication of the draft WOTUS rule, western state developments include:

• New Mexico: The New Mexico Environment Department commenced the formal rulemaking process for amendments to the state’s regulations to create a discharge permit and dredge and fill permit program in a petition to the state’s Water Quality Control Commission on Nov. 24, 2025. This action follows legislation and informal regulatory activities earlier in 2025 (read more here). The petition requests a rulemaking hearing in June or July of 2026.

• Colorado: The Colorado Water Quality Control Commission completed a three-day rulemaking hearing on December 8-10, 2025, in which the WQCC adopted Regulation 87 creating a new state permitting program for discharges of dredged or fill material (Reg. 87 Dredge and Fill). Key issues resolved in the hearing included (a) standards for mitigation of ephemeral and intermittent streams; (b) projects requiring dual jurisdiction between state and federal programs; (c) whether to include a broad scale public interest review; (d) definition of a state-specific exclusion for wetlands adjacent to and supported by ditches; (e) the procedure to determine a project’s purpose and need, practicable alternatives and the subsequent alternatives analysis without injuring water rights; and (f) the fee structure for the program, which deviates significantly from the Army Corps’ fees.

• Arizona: The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has developed a list called the “Protected Surface Waters List” (PSWL), which includes both WOTUS and Non-WOTUS waters. If a water meets the federal CWA definition of a WOTUS, it is automatically included on the PSWL and regulated as a federally protected water. Waters deemed not to be a WOTUS under the current federal definition may be regulated through ADEQ’s Surface Water Protection Program (SWPP) as a Non-WOTUS Protected Surface Water if that water meets the definition of a state protected surface water, in accordance with Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S) §49-221(G). The PSWL is advisory only and does not constitute a final agency action or a jurisdictional determination for any water. It was created as part of the SWPP to increase regulatory clarity in Arizona. ADEQ does not have current plans to conduct a formal rulemaking to update the lists until guidance for a new WOTUS definition is finally released by the federal agencies (the EPA and United States Department of the Army) in response to the Sackett decision. (See 90 Fed. Reg. 52498, November 20, 2025). A list of waters regulated as WOTUS can be found in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 18, Chapter 11 (R18-11), Article 2 in Table B and Table C. A list of Non-WOTUS Protected Surface Waters can be found in R18–11, Article 2, Table A. If additional legal challenges are filed against the new WOTUS proposal by the federal agencies, then ADEQ will delay any final PWSL formal rulemaking.

What the Regulated Community Should Know Moving Forward

A significant issue going forward will be the relationship between state and federal programs, particularly given the differences between state definitions of “state waters” subject to regulation and the ever-shifting definition of WOTUS. Every action on the definition of WOTUS should be anticipated to prompt a reaction, at least in some states. Regulated entities should engage regarding both the federal WOTUS rule and in state processes to ensure their concerns are heard.

Precision means trying to find out the exact amount of input a plant needs.” On Dec. 10, growers connected with Ag-Center experts, state officials and representatives from the precision agriculture industry at the AgCenter’s Precision Agriculture Summit in Alexandria.
“Precision agriculture can generate great economic benefits provided we use it in the right way,” Goyal said while presenting at the summit.
Many precision agriculture technologies have developed slowly over the past 40 years, Zhou said, and recent technological advancements have accelerated the field’s progress.
For now, most precision agriculture technologies require a great deal of human labor, whether operating spraying drones or analyzing data.","Agricultural producers throughout Louisiana are embracing precision agriculture — a management strategy that relies on drones, sensors, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to collect data and make informed decisions to improve crop yields.

For decades, LSU Ag-Center researchers and extension agents have researched and taught producers about precision agriculture tools, such as sensors that aid in identifying plant stress and pinpoint crops’ fertilizer needs or variable rate technologies that can apply right amount of fertilizer, herbicide, fungicide and water at the right location.

As the precision agriculture realm has grown, the AgCenter has increased research and educational efforts to advance the field and added specialists, such as Congliang Zhou, an assistant professor for research and extension.

“For crop production, we need to have a lot of inputs — fertilizer, water, pesticides,” said Zhou, the AgCenter precision agriculture extension specialist. “But not every plant needs the same amount. Precision means trying to find out the exact amount of input a plant needs.”

On Dec. 10, growers connected with Ag-Center experts, state officials and representatives from the precision agriculture industry at the AgCenter’s Precision Agriculture Summit in Alexandria. At the summit, AgCenter researchers and extension specialists presented their findings on a wide range of topics that fit within the parameters of precision agriculture.

Precision agriculture research at the AgCenter explores several different avenues: using sensors to analyze soil and plant needs, testing sprayer drones that target weeds or dispense harvest aids over sugarcane, developing smartphone applications that can identify insects and many other projects.

These technologies have the potential to save producers time and money while also alleviating farm labor shortages, according to Raghav Goyal, an economist in the AgCenter Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness.

“Precision agriculture can generate great economic benefits provided we use it in the right way,” Goyal said while presenting at the summit.

Many precision agriculture technologies have developed slowly over the past 40 years, Zhou said, and recent technological advancements have accelerated the field’s progress.

For more than a decade, AgCenter engineer Randy Price has worked to test and improve agricultural drones while educating producers and young people about the technology. He has seen rapid improvements in unmanned aerial vehicles and has noticed an uptick in farmers adopting them.

“It looks viable now, and there is a lot of interest,” said Price, who is an associate professor based at the AgCenter Dean Lee Research and Extension Center in Alexandria. “They are remotely piloted, so it’s really safe for the pilot. We don’t worry about someone getting hurt or killed. And they are low cost — $20,000 to $30,000 or cheaper — and you could buy something and start spraying after meeting a few rules versus an airplane that’s $1 million or more or a (tractor-based) spray rig that is $500,000 or more. So, they’re really lucrative from those standpoints.”

Many Louisiana growers were introduced to precision agriculture through variable rate technologies, which relies on high-tech farm implements to vary the amounts of inputs such as fertilizer or pesticides applied to a field. The application amounts differ because of crop needs in specific areas, and these technologies can save farms money and prevent excess nutrients from washing off the field into waterways, said Brenda Tubaña, professor of soil fertility in the AgCenter School of Plant, Environmental and Soil Sciences.

“You’re not wasting fertilizer nor applying for nothing,” Tubaña said during her presentation at the summit.

During a panel discussion at the event, growers explained that precision agriculture has helped them become more efficient and save money, especially through variable rate technology. Using large drones to spray ripeners that aid in harvesting sugarcane has delivered a great return on investment for some producers and has allowed them to spray the ripeners, which promote sugar accumulation before harvest, at an optimal time.

“I want to sweeten my cane when I want to sweeten my cane,” said Josh Hebert, a central Louisiana farmer who bought a drone so he did not have to wait for a crop duster during the busy preharvest season.

Improvements in artificial intelligence also have unlocked new pathways for digital agriculture tools.

Ivan Grijalva, an Ag-Center assistant professor focused on precision pest management and data analytics, applies machine learning to train computers to detect redbanded stink bugs and other pest-related challenges, including weeds and diseases. He aims to develop technologies that help farmers scout fields more efficiently and generate prescription maps to guide management decisions and minimize chemical inputs.

Zhou has developed a robot that moves through sugarcane fields to help count cane stalks and assist with sugarcane breeding and variety development.

“When the robotic system is moving through the field, the sensor will collect data from different angles of each plot,” Zhou said. “Humans can only see from one angle. That’s the advantage. Then, AI can process the data in the field in real time, and based on our preliminary results, it will be more accurate than people we send into the field.”

The future of precision agriculture is “very exciting to see,” Zhou said. For now, most precision agriculture technologies require a great deal of human labor, whether operating spraying drones or analyzing data. That work will eventually be automated, too, Zhou said.

“Because labor shortages are a top issue for American agriculture,” he said, “I feel like AI and automation will be the future.”

Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it.

If you’re only going to read one article on climate change this year, let it be this one.

One of Prism’s goals is to provide readers not just with accurate news about current events, but with the context needed to situate those events in the larger political landscape. Not just what is happening, but why and how. While Prism can’t cover every climate story, the reporting we do prioritize provides a way to read between the lines and connect the dots between seemingly disparate issues to paint a picture of how struggles for environmental justice are connected.

As promised by Project 2025, the Trump administration’s blueprint for dismantling the federal government, the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is disappearing. The U.S. is entering a period in which industry has near-total free rein to squeeze out profits in whatever ways it sees fit—including the weakening of regulations that govern chemical exposure and refusing to carry out programs for communities impacted by environmental justice.

As Prism has reported throughout the year, environmental injustice is not simply a category of harms levied onto vulnerable and disinvested communities of color, but the result of centuries of policy decisions. Legislative spending bills are statements of value and intentions for the future.

The last two decades in eastern Kentucky are prime examples. The community has spent years fending off attempts by Republican Rep. Hal Rogers to build a $500 million medium security prison. Appalachia has long been vulnerable to extractive industries, from coal mining to timber harvesting. In 2018, community groups succeeded in making sure that legacies of extraction would not continue into the modern era through the extraction of people’s bodies from their home communities. But the victory was short-lived, and the project was revived four years later. This year, however, an Indigenous women-led organization called the Appalachian Rekindling Project purchased some of the land slated for development, forcing the federal Bureau of Prisons to go back to the drawing board.

Prism has long drawn the manifold connections between incarceration and climate justice. This year, Prism Senior Reporter Alexandra Martinez doggedly covered the construction and legal evolution of the South Florida Detention Facility, also known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” because of its siting in the Everglades, a critical ecosystem that is home to hundreds of plant and animal species. The initial cost of Alligator Alcatraz was $608 million with a predicted annual cost of $450 million.

Built over eight days in late June, the immigrant detention center quickly drew ire from Indigenous tribes and local Floridians, who said that the development of the facility endangered those locked inside its walls as well as the ecosystems surrounding it.

Prism obtained records of a phone call made from a person detained inside the facility to his fiancée, in which he described how guards failed to provide emergency medical treatment to an immigrant who collapsed. He also described how guards subjected those detained at Alligator Alcatraz to chronic and arbitrary abuse, including beatings and humiliation, and how those inside did not have regular access to food and water. In December, the humanitarian group Amnesty International published its findings on the conditions inside the detention center, reporting that the treatment of immigrants detained at the facility operated by the Florida Department of Emergency Management constituted “torture.”

Most reporting portrays climate change as a series of discrete ecological events characterized by temperature variations: warmer oceans, colder winters, or more frequent storms. What these stories so often fail to acknowledge is that climate change isn’t just the weather. Rather, it’s the result of policy decisions that prioritize where to spend money and what—or who—to withhold public funding from.

In July, Prism reported on a surprise mid-May cancellation of environmental justice grants by the EPA. Grant recipients, such as Ira Vandever of the Navajo Nation, whose work includes the restoration of land polluted with heavy metals, were given notice via email with little information about how to appeal the arbitrary decision. Those with canceled grants were also left in the dark and on the hook for any funding gaps. Through public and political pressure, funding for some grantees, such as the Mi’kmaq Nation in Maine, was restored within a month of cancellation.

It wasn’t just grassroots pollution remediation efforts that suffered this year at the hands of a rogue EPA, but those relying on EPA grants to prepare regions against the impacts of mounting weather effects such as flooding.

Federal funding provides a critical bridge to emergency preparedness, but the Trump administration has placed its focus on the continued vilification of so-called DEI projects, a not-so-subtle dog whistle to the communities that benefit disproportionately from these programs. The cancellation of 105 grants selected by the Biden administration as part of the Community Change Grants program put a wrench in climate preparedness efforts led by communities in Appalachia, Mississippi, and Alaska. The program allocated funds through the Inflation Reduction Act to help address environmental justice issues, including supporting regions most vulnerable to the impacts of a rapidly changing climate and most unable to bear the financial fallout on their own.

These dire environmental challenges were made even worse when the Trump administration’s EPA announced its intention in August to scrap the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a rule that facilitated Clean Air Act regulation of greenhouse gases such as the air pollutant carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is in fact the most ubiquitous greenhouse gas and a major precipitator of global climate change. Already, the U.S. plays an outsized role in protracting climate change through its disproportionate per capita emissions and has demonstrated a continued ability to skirt international law, but the Trump administration’s dismantling of bedrock rules enshrines extractive supremacy and never-before-seen profits for polluters.

With no funding to mitigate environmental impacts brought by climate change and corporate injustices, it’s also important to note the slashing of the legal mechanisms available to environmental organizers fighting to protect ecosystem health. This summer, the Supreme Court gutted the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which provided activists with the ability to sue to stop destructive development projects sure to impact sensitive ecosystems and species. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of industry to restrict NEPA and the EPA’s ability to evaluate the downstream impacts of projects, which Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus referred to in the Texas Law Review as an “unraveling of the nation’s environmental protection laws.”

The second Trump administration’s dismantling of the EPA has also been a windfall for data centers across the country, especially in areas where state-level environmental agencies don’t have the funding or capacity to fill the federal gap in oversight. There are currently 4,296 data centers across the U.S., most clustered in Republican states where land is cheaper and that are more proximate to natural gas pipelines.

Data centers gobble up energy, resources, and water at alarming rates—actions made worse by the lack of federal guidelines regarding facilities’ usage. Communities targeted for data center development are also frustrated with the noise, water, and air pollution that results from their operation.

Data centers force communities to contend with increasing rates of pollution, but the facilities also drive up the costs of utilities. Ratepayers are tasked with footing the bill, mainly for upgrades to regional energy grid systems that are not accustomed to such large increases in power consumption. Data centers can consume as much energy as whole cities. In 2024, for example, data centers accounted for 4% of the country’s electricity consumption.

All of the movement around data centers puts a wrinkle in the country’s desire to decarbonize transportation, transition the energy grid to renewable sources, and see prices come down for critical services and goods such as heating and cooling. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are far cheaper than fossil fuels. For example, 91% of renewable energy projects commissioned in 2024 were more cost-effective than fossil fuel alternatives. In other words, renewable energy is good economics.

Perhaps one of the biggest—and most underreported—climate stories of the year is that the voting public isn’t aligned with current political leadership. According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, 63% of adults are very worried about global climate change, 74% support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 66% want a total transition to clean energy by 2050.

Americans’ stated desires are in direct opposition to the Trump administration’s actions. Voters want clear changes to the status quo, and sooner or later, elected officials will have to answer to climate change—either because voters take action or because the consequences of climate change become too loud to ignore.

He made the statement after the U.S. Department of Justice filed its response Monday night to the request for a preliminary injunction to change dam operations for the four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Oregon and four Columbia River dams downriver from the Tri-Cities.
“These losses come at exactly the wrong time,” said Scott Simms, chief executive director of the Public Power Council.
Trump administration ended agreement The Public Power Council is asking the federal court to encourage a collaborative path forward.
Opponents of the agreement called it a roadmap to removal of the lower Snake River dams.","A requested emergency order to change operations at Columbia and Snake river hydroelectric dams would raise electricity costs 17% for many Northwest customers, according to the Bonneville Power Administration.

States and groups seeking help for endangered salmon and steelhead in a decades-long federal lawsuit have asked the court for an emergency order to spill more water over eight dams, lowering the reservoirs behind them.

The changes are needed to protect endangered salmon and steelhead, say those requesting the temporary order, including the state of Oregon, conservation, fishing and clean energy groups. The state of Washington supports the filing.

According to Earthjustice, spilling more water over dams would allow more juvenile fish to pass over the dams instead of through hydroelectric turbines, and the lower reservoir levels would shorten the time salmon spend migrating through slower and warmer water behind dams.

‘Hidden double-digit tax’

But the Public Power Council, a defendant in the case, says that those changes have no proven benefits to fish and would drive up electricity costs by $152 million to $169 million annually.

The Public Power Council represents nearly 100 consumer-owned electric utilities across the Pacific Northwest, including in the Tri-Cities.

“The litigation is like a hidden double-digit tax on electricity customers that threatens real harm to lower-income families, schools, farms and businesses without providing any proven benefits to salmon,” said Kurt Miller, chief executive officer of the Northwest Public Power Association. NWPPA represents 150 community-owned electric utilities.

He made the statement after the U.S. Department of Justice filed its response Monday night to the request for a preliminary injunction to change dam operations for the four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Oregon and four Columbia River dams downriver from the Tri-Cities. The response included the BPA analysis.

The BPA analysis warned that the proposed operational changes would make frequent grid emergencies, such as energy shortages and rotating blackouts, inevitable.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, with the support of Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, has initiated litigation that “threatens the very citizens who they were elected to represent,” Miller said.

The Public Power Council said that the changes would eliminate about 2 million megawatt-hours of hydropower production each year while increase carbon emissions as the lost hydropower is replaced primarily by natural gas generation.

“These losses come at exactly the wrong time,” said Scott Simms, chief executive director of the Public Power Council. The Pacific Northwest is facing rapid growth in demand for electricity, he said,

The amount of water spilled over hydro dams has already been increased, and more spill would yield only small, incremental improvements for fish, said Andrew Deines, managing scientist at Exponent, whose opinion was included in court documents opposing the preliminary injunction.

Trump administration ended agreement

The Public Power Council is asking the federal court to encourage a collaborative path forward.

“After more than two decades of litigation, it should be clear that court-ordered operational mandates are not a durable solution,” Simms said. “The region needs a negotiated approach that support salmon recovery, respects tribal treaty rights, protects grid reliability and keeps power affordable for the people of the Northwest.”

The request for a preliminary injunction was filed in October after the Trump administration ended the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement with tribes and the states of Oregon and Washington that was signed by the Biden administration.

The 2023 agreement put the decades-long federal case on hold, while removal of four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Washington was studied and the federal government paid for salmon recovery and tribal renewable energy projects.

Signed by the Nez Perce and other tribes in the basin, the agreement was seen by salmon advocates as a breakthrough in their decades-long effort to recover wild salmon and steelhead that are protected by the Endangered Species Act.

Opponents of the agreement called it a roadmap to removal of the lower Snake River dams.

The proposed preliminary injunction would require emergency conservation measures in addition to changes to dam operations.

They include removing passage barriers slowing the migration of Tucannon River spring chinook in Eastern Washington, as well as increasing federal efforts to control predators like invasive walleye and some birds that prey on salmon and steelhead.",https://www.thenewstribune.com/public/latest-news/3hn5q8/picture259834625/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/220326%20cb%20salmon_54.JPG,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:05.271819

Council members broadly face two options.
Meanwhile, the City Council just voted to shave $95 million from its annual budget after voters rejected a property tax hike in November.
""There's no question this project is going to cost a lot,"" City Council Member Chito Vela told KUT News.
""This is hugely concerning,"" City Council Member Paige Ellis said at a Mobility Committee meeting this month upon hearing the news.","A looming decision over parks above I-35 is forcing Austin City Council members to weigh two risky paths forward, and elected officials are beginning to split over which direction the city should take.

This fork in the road centers on a deceptively simple question: Which highway decks should the city commit to paying for?

Council members broadly face two options. They could agree now to building the full set of caps the city has planned, effectively locking them into the massive I-35 expansion project as it moves forward. Or they could hold off, leaving the door open to adding caps later, but at a significantly higher cost.

Either way, most of the payments wouldn't be due until the early 2030s. But the answer will shape how much the project ultimately costs and could determine whether large sections of I-35 ever get capped at all.

Council members split on what to do

The general footprint of the city's ""Cap and Stitch"" project was already set in May. A divided City Council agreed to spend $104 million in future years on the support columns and foundations needed to hold the decks over I-35 after the Texas Department of Transportation sinks the main lanes.

Under that plan, the largest sequence of caps would span I-35 from Cesar Chavez Street to Seventh Street, potentially creating one of the most prominent parks in Central Austin.

Another cap would cover the freeway between 11th and 12th streets, providing a gateway to Austin's African-American Cultural Heritage District. Two smaller ""stitches,"" each roughly 300 feet wide, would be built near the Hancock Center between 41st Street and Capital Metro's Red Line crossing.

What the council has not decided is whether and when to commit to paying for the decks themselves. TxDOT is rebuilding the highway, but it will not fund the caps. That decision now sits squarely with the city.

Both options carry real risks. Committing early would require the council to act before detailed designs are finished, creating uncertainty around the final price tag. Waiting would reduce that uncertainty, but city and state officials agree it would drive up the cost by 35% or more and could make some caps harder to build.

The project's price tag is murky at this relatively early stage, but estimates have pegged the cost of the 14 acres of decks — with nothing on them yet — at almost $400 million. Meanwhile, the City Council just voted to shave $95 million from its annual budget after voters rejected a property tax hike in November.

""There's no question this project is going to cost a lot,"" City Council Member Chito Vela told KUT News. ""The reality is, though, when it's done it will have huge economic benefits in terms of additional property tax revenues that are going to be brought in to the city.""

Vela pointed in particular to the stretch of I-35 closest to downtown. ""Looking at that highway cap between Cesar Chavez through Seventh Street, if we were to cap that area of the highway and put some nice amenities on it, we are potentially building one of the best downtown parks in Texas,"" he said.

Other council members are more wary.

Council Member Krista Laine, who voted against the project in May, said the financial risk has only increased since then. She pointed to inflation, tariffs, labor shortages and the Trump administration's decision to cancel a $105 million federal grant for the Cap and Stitch project.

""I haven't heard any news about new funding sources that have come into play. It's been many months since we had that discussion and took that vote,"" Laine told KUT News. ""We need to make sure that we have enough capacity for the needs of the city, given the very significant revenue constraints.""

City and TxDOT disagree on May deadline

Adding urgency to the situation is an apparent disconnect between how TxDOT and city of Austin staff view the project's next milestone.

TxDOT says it needs an estimate by May of how many caps the city is considering funding with a formal council vote in November. The state agency says it needs an approximate number so it can start negotiations with highway design firms.

City staff see it differently, saying they can't provide even an early signal about how much highway the city plans to cap without formal direction from the City Council. From their perspective, the city's governance structure doesn't give staff the leeway to offer even a ballpark estimate on a project involving hundreds of millions of dollars.

As a result, city staff are treating May as a firm decision point. They're asking council members to vote by then on how much, if anything, the city is willing to commit toward the caps, even if a formal funding decision isn't required by TxDOT until November.

""This is hugely concerning,"" City Council Member Paige Ellis said at a Mobility Committee meeting this month upon hearing the news.

Emissions trading, one of the most – if not the most – crucial climate policy instruments, will be a key focus.
The EU has set a price on CO2 emissions to incentivise the right investments by companies to shift to a climate friendly society.
However, election dynamics could spell further trouble for ambitious climate policy decisions next year.
The EU’s climate and energy agenda in 2026 will also be marked by a continued focus on industry competitiveness, and a general drive for independence.","After a year marked by the rollback of existing climate rules – from weakening deforestation regulations and company sustainability reporting obligations, to postponing emissions trading in transport and buildings – the EU will begin looking forward in its climate debates in 2026. Negotiations on the European Union’s next long-term budget, alongside talks on climate and energy rules for the post-2030 period, are set to take centre stage.

“After adopting the 90-percent climate target for 2040, the debate will shift towards what this means for individual sectors in the post-2030 policy framework and how to mobilise investments,” said Linda Kalcher, executive director and founder of the Brussels-based think tank Strategic Perspectives.

Similar to the 2021 “Fit for 55” package of energy and climate reform proposals to reach the 2030 target of reducing emissions by 55 percent, the European Commission is expected to present a follow-up package next year. In the third quarter, it plans to propose reforms to key rules and regulations, from the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the renewable energy framework to the future of national climate targets currently governed by the effort sharing regulation.

Climate policy has given room to other priorities over the past years, and if current efforts to weaken policies to avoid and reduce greenhouse gas emissions persist, the EU risks locking in an energy and climate architecture that lacks the necessary ambition to sufficiently contribute to the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to well below 2 °C.

Emissions trading, one of the most – if not the most – crucial climate policy instruments, will be a key focus. The EU has set a price on CO2 emissions to incentivise the right investments by companies to shift to a climate friendly society.

EU countries recently decided to delay the start of the new ETS 2 for transport and building emissions by one year to 2028. Several governments worried that a uniform CO2 price across the EU would lead to steep increases in petrol, fossil gas or heating oil costs, which would hit low-income households in poorer member states especially hard, as these often lack the resources to switch to climate-friendly alternatives. Governments said this could fuel public resistance to climate action.

However, experts warned that further changes to the system loom, especially if the EU fails to alleviate governments’ worries. Countries like Poland had called for the start of the system to be delayed by several years, and could easily make the same arguments half a year from now.

“Of course, this will be discussed again,” said Brigitte Knopf, founder of the think tank Zukunft KlimaSozial.

Similarly, the original ETS for the energy and industry sectors is facing headwinds. Industry has called for adjustments that would weaken the system, and German officials have proposed extending the ETS by several years. Under current rules, the emissions cap is set to reach zero by around 2039, so no new allowances would be given out from that time, leaving only existing unused allowances in the market. The European Commission is set to review the ETS by summer. That review, together with the package to reach the 2040 climate target, will present key moments to kickstart reforms to the system.

Experts have called on countries to ensure that the ETS is preserved.

“If ETS-1 is substantially watered down in 2026, without massively strengthening other pillars, the whole structure risks collapsing, tanking overall clean investments,” Philipp Jäger, senior policy fellow at the Jacques Delors Centre think tank, told Clean Energy Wire. Germany and other EU governments that still back climate objectives should do more to safeguard it, he said.

However, election dynamics could spell further trouble for ambitious climate policy decisions next year. In 2027, voters in major European economies - including France, Italy, and Poland - head to the polls.

“The importance of 2027 as a 'super-election year' in the EU should not be understated,” said researcher Kalcher. “It brings additional volatility,” as countries might struggle to position themselves ahead of elections, she said.

The EU’s climate and energy agenda in 2026 will also be marked by a continued focus on industry competitiveness, and a general drive for independence.

In its 2026 work programme, titled “Europe's Independence Moment”, the European Commission has said that the EU must “shape its own future” on wide-ranging issues like climate action, security and defence, the development of its democracy or jobs and a modern economy.

Europe’s ability to do so will be influenced by several crucial political dynamics, said think tank E3G in a preview article for 2026. Europe’s strategic dependencies leave it exposed to foreign influence and interference, while an increasingly fragmented European Parliament lacks one stable majority, which makes the institution’s positions on issues less predictable.

The think tank sees four challenges for the EU’s independence bid:

Rebuilding Europe’s financial autonomy and capacity to invest

Harnessing electrification and circularity as levers for strategic autonomy, competitiveness and energy security

Protecting citizens while visibly delivering tangible benefits

Diversifying partnerships and deepening international cooperation

Throughout next year, the EU institutions will negotiate the Commission’s draft for the union’s next long-term budget for the period from 2028 to 2034. The Commission has proposed dedicating 35 percent of the almost two-trillion-euro budget to climate and environment objectives, which NGOs have criticised as too little. E3G emphasises that the EU must also set the right framework to rebuild investor confidence and improve its capacity to mobilise private capital.

Researcher Kalcher said Europe should make sure it invests domestically, instead of paying third countries for imports. “With the EU budget on the table and the proposals on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and industrial decarbonisation coming, it’s high time to invest into Europe instead of sending money to the US, Russia or Qatar,” she said.

Europe remains heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, and the transition to renewables is seen as an opportunity to reduce these dependencies overall.

E3G calls on the EU to push for a more circular economy in 2026, as this would lower imports and energy use, “creating new markets for affordable, European recycled materials and products.” The upcoming Industrial Accelerator Act, Circular Economy Act, Innovation Act, and revised public procurement rules are expected to be key developments in this regard next year.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-17 11:00:09.973541

“They're cancelling a number of large EVs that they had planned, but they're not abandoning the EV market,” Tucker said.
Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.","Ford is scrapping plans to make fully electric full-sized pickups.

Ford will take a roughly $20 billion hit, but the company expects the recalibration of its electric vehicle strategy to prove more profitable in the long run.

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said the “customer-driven shift” will strengthen the company.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business,” Farley said in an announcement Monday.

Kelley Blue Book automotive expert Sean Tucker said the cancellation of the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup headlines the changes announced by Ford.

“They're cancelling a number of large EVs that they had planned, but they're not abandoning the EV market,” Tucker said.

Ford said it still expects about half of its global inventory will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030, up from 17% this year.

And the company has big plans for its universal EV platform, which will be used to roll out lower-priced, smaller cars and trucks, beginning with a midsize pickup in 2027.

Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV uses gas power to recharge the EV battery, but the gas doesn't directly power the vehicle's movement.

The engine is effectively a generator, not actually attached to the drivetrain in any way, Tucker said.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.

“All trucks lose about half the range when they tow, regardless of what their fuel source is,” Tucker said. “But that's a much bigger deal when stopping to recharge takes hours than it is when stopping to fill a tank takes two minutes.”

Plus, big trucks are most popular in the parts of the country where EV infrastructure is poor, Tucker said.

Ford said the next-generation extended-range EV, or EREV, F-150 Lightning will add an estimated 700-plus mile range and tow “like a locomotive.”

Tucker said Ford made the right call.

“It was an understandable decision in 2021 to say, ‘Our bestselling product is the F-150. Why don’t we just electrify our bestselling product first?’ But the market for electric full-size trucks is just, it hasn't really emerged,” Tucker said. “And I think that the EREV is probably a more realistic technology, that the sort of person who's interested in a full-size truck might listen to that more than they would to a pure EV.”

RELATED STORY: Trump tries to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements

Tucker said KBB estimates that dealers have about a 147-day supply of fully electric F-150 Lightning trucks, so folks who want to buy one still have time.

Tucker said American automakers have a tough time balancing domestic and international markets, with about a quarter of the overseas market already electric. Stateside, it’s just 7% or so, Tucker said.

That creates a two-tiered, expensive production strategy, one for the North American market and one for the rest of the world.

Tucker said the U.S. market is still moving toward EVs, but it’s moving more slowly than initial projections.

And Tucker said Ford’s decisions have more to do with market demands than politics, with President Donald Trump trying to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements.

“Politicians want a lot of headlines talking about the automotive industry, but the automotive industry does not move at the speed of politics,” Tucker said. “If you sit down to design a new car today, it's going to roll out to the public in about five to seven years. It's a long design cycle. So, I don't think they're making a lot of quick decisions based on something the president did last month.”",https://midmichigannow.com/resources/media2/16x9/8380/1320/47x575/90/443d8481-4e5a-4d33-97ee-293b7f730794-GettyImages2252102754.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:01:48.287166

The combined entity retains the Workhorse brand identity and will continue trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol “WKHS.” This consolidation positions the company to address the estimated $23 billion medium-duty commercial vehicle market.

Highlights

Secured up to $50 million in new debt financing to support growth and supply chain operations.

Combined manufacturing capacity targets over 5,000 vehicles annually.

Scott Griffith appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the combined entity.

Established commercial relationships with 10 of North America’s largest fleet operators.

Financial Structure and Capitalization

Concurrent with the merger’s closing, the company has strengthened its financial position through new debt financing capacity provided by Motiv’s legacy controlling investor. The agreement unlocks up to $50 million in total capital availability. This includes approximately $10 million accessible via a revolving credit facility.

An additional $40 million is allocated specifically to fund supply-chain costs associated with new purchase orders. Management anticipates this liquidity will materially reduce order-to-delivery timelines and support immediate growth initiatives. The company enters 2026 with a clean balance sheet and access to public capital markets.

Manufacturing and Operational Capabilities

The combined company leverages significant existing infrastructure to scale production without requiring immediate major capital expenditures. Manufacturing operations will continue at the “Workhorse Ranch” in Union City, Indiana. This 436,000-square-foot facility sits on 92.6 acres and features:

A nameplate annual production capacity of 5,200 vehicles.

Integrated production and logistics centers.

A dedicated customer training center.

A Noise, Vibration, and Handling (NVH) test track.

200,000 square feet of additional vehicle storage space.

Workhorse also benefits from data gathered through the “Stables project,” a FedEx Ground Independent Service Provider (ISP) fleet operating in Ohio. This initiative utilizes a mix of internal combustion and electric step vans to generate real-time performance data. These insights directly inform range planning, durability testing, and route optimization.

Leadership and Corporate Governance

The merger introduces a refreshed executive team with experience in automotive scaling and commercial fleet sales. Scott Griffith assumes the role of Chief Executive Officer. Joining him in the C-suite are Bob Ginnan as Chief Financial Officer, James Griffin as Chief Revenue Officer, Scott Zion as Chief Product Officer, and Josh Anderson as Executive Vice President of Operations.

The new Board of Directors consists of seven members, five of whom were designated by Motiv. Matthew O’Leary will serve as Chairman. The company will initially maintain its headquarters in Wixom, Michigan, with future plans to expand its presence within the Detroit metropolitan area. It also retains operational footprints in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the Bay Area of California.

Shareholder Communication

CEO Scott Griffith has released a letter to shareholders detailing the strategic vision and immediate priorities for the post-merger organization. The full text of the letter is available at ir.workhorse.com.

Advisors

Legal counsel for Workhorse was provided by Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP, with Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher serving as the strategic communications advisor.

Solar gained momentum in regions once seen as peripheral, from Central Europe to Africa, while BRICS nations crossed a major milestone by generating more than half of global solar power. Rapid advances in battery technology and a decline in prices brought around-the-clock solar into credible, near-commercial reality, opening the door to fossil-free baseload power in sunny regions.

The rise of “electrotech” – solar, wind, batteries and electrified transport, heating and industry – became the dominant engine of global energy growth, led by China’s emergence as the world’s first electrostate. As AI and data centre demand grew, clean power and strong grids became the new competitive edge for modern economies.

Clean energy momentum builds as solar and wind outpace global electricity demand growth

Solar and wind are now expanding fast enough to meet all new electricity demand, a milestone reached in the first three quarters of 2025. Ember’s analysis published in November shows that these technologies are no longer just catching up; they are outpacing demand growth itself. Together, solar and wind supplied 17.6% of global electricity in the first three quarters of 2025, up from 15.2% over the same period last year, pushing the total share of low-carbon sources to 43%.

For the first time across a sustained period, renewables, including solar, wind, hydro and smaller sources such as geothermal, generated more electricity than coal. At the heart of this shift is solar, whose growth was more than three times larger than any other source of electricity so far in 2025, confirming its role as the dominant force reshaping the global power system. Another analysis showed that the world is set to add 793 GW of renewable capacity in 2025, up 11% from the 717 GW added in 2024. At this pace, only a modest increase in annual additions is needed for the world to stay on track to triple global renewables by 2030.

Solar starting to take off in places that were once behind

In 2025, solar strengthened in markets that had long trailed behind the global leaders, as solar showed its potential to leapfrog fossil generation in emerging markets. Several countries outside the traditional frontrunners like China and Europe, are now recording sharper growth thanks to falling costs, easing supply bottlenecks and clearer policy signals.

In August 2025, Ember reported that there’s clear evidence of solar now accelerating across Africa. Imports of Chinese solar panels rose 60% in the 12 months to June 2025, with South Africa still the largest buyer but 20 other countries also posting record orders. Total imports reached 15 GW of capacity, up from 9.4 GW the year before. Some markets saw dramatic jumps. Algeria’s imports rose 33-fold, Zambia eightfold, Botswana sevenfold and Sudan sixfold, while Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Benin, Angola and Ethiopia all more than tripled their imports.

Central Europe, a region once behind on solar generation, is now expanding faster than many traditional European Union (EU) leaders. Summer 2025 underscored this momentum. In June, Hungary generated more than 40% of its electricity from solar, while Poland and Czechia also recorded their highest monthly solar output to date.

By 2024, the ten BRICS countries accounted for more than half of global solar generation – 51%, up from just 15% a decade earlier. This rapid rise signals a major shift in the centre of gravity of the global energy transition.

Rising solar and wind have reached scale in major electricity markets worldwide

2025 showed that wind and solar are now reaching scale in major economies around the world, fundamentally reshaping the energy system. In August, wind and solar generated over a third of Brazil’s electricity for the first month on record. In the EU, solar became the single largest source of power in June 2025. In Spain, expanding wind and solar has slashed the pricing power of fossil generators by 75% since 2019. The UK crossed a major threshold in September 2025 as wind and solar delivered more than half its electricity for the first time. California reached its own milestone too, with solar now standing as the state’s largest source of power. India is moving in the same direction. Ember’s October 2025 analysis showed that the country does not need to build coal capacity beyond what is already planned under its National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2032, provided it meets targets for solar, wind and storage.

The common thread is clear: as clean power reaches higher shares, it begins to set the price, weaken the influence of expensive fossil fuel-based generation and reduce imports. What once looked like just growth is now transforming market dynamics, affordability and energy security all at once.

Electrotech revolution accelerates in 2025

Electrotech, a set of efficient, scalable electricity-based technologies like solar, wind, batteries, EVs and heat pumps, is now the main driver of global energy growth. Solar capacity has doubled roughly every three years for 30 years, battery storage has nearly doubled annually since 2020 and EV sales have surged fifteenfold to 17.5 million since 2017. China, the world’s first “electrostate,” leads this transformation. It accounts for half of global solar panel installations, 60% of EV sales and two-thirds of global growth in electricity demand since 2019. In H1-2025, China’s fossil demand in electricity generation was down by 2%. Emerging markets from Viet Nam to Mexico and South Africa to India are leapfrogging older fossil systems, surpassing the United States in solar’s share of electricity. Mastery of the electric tech stack like batteries, motors and power electronics is now critical for industrial growth, jobs and strategic autonomy.

24/365 Solar is now within reach – thanks to rapidly falling battery costs

Steep declines in battery costs and rapid storage deployment are turning solar into a reliable power source for almost 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Ember’s June 2025 analysis shows that in high-insolation regions, solar paired with batteries can already deliver round-the-clock electricity at around US $104/MWh, undercutting new coal and nuclear, making “solar as baseload” both technically credible and increasingly cost-competitive. Mexico illustrates the potential benefits of such a shift: falling battery prices could unlock gigawatts of new solar and cut reliance on imported fossil fuels, with Ember estimating annual savings of about $1.6 billion USD from avoided gas imports.

India’s heavy industry story highlights another frontier of opportunity: large industrial consumers can now meet up to 80% of their annual electricity needs with clean power by combining solar, wind and storage in a cost-effective procurement mix. In many regions of India, the cost of such hybrid, round-the-clock clean power is already competitive with, and often cheaper than, coal-based supply.

Batteries are also emerging as a multi-tool for the power sector. Beyond storing excess RE, they provide fast frequency response, black start capabilities and other essential grid services that strengthen system reliability.

As storage costs continue to drop, solar-plus-batteries is emerging as the most scalable pathway to clean, reliable, fossil fuel-free electricity.

Clean power becomes the foundation of the global AI race

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data centre growth became one of the most discussed energy issues of 2025. Those able to meet rising electricity demand will be positioned at the forefront of the technology revolution – and solar and wind are proving they are up to the job. Ember’s ASEAN analysis showed that data centres could account for 2–30% of national electricity demand by 2030, excluding Viet Nam. In Malaysia, for example, emissions could increase sevenfold if this growth is met with fossil-heavy grids, while up to 30% of this demand could instead be supplied by solar and wind. In Europe, the bottleneck is infrastructure: grid congestion in hubs such as Frankfurt, London and Dublin has created 7–10-year connection queues, pushing new AI investment toward regions with cleaner, more available capacity. The message is clear: the AI race is now an electricity and grid race. Countries that scale renewables and accelerate grid upgrades will be the ones that capture the next wave of digital economic growth.

What’s in store for 2026?

As 2025 comes to an end, the direction of travel is unmistakable: clean power is scaling, markets are shifting and the electricity system is becoming the centre of economic strategy – from AI growth to energy security. In 2026, the challenge will be turning this momentum into system-level transformation. Countries that expand storage, fix grid bottlenecks, set higher ambition and empower markets to integrate renewables will shape the next phase of global leadership.

The current administration has been rolling back permits for renewable energy projects, including hydrogen, in the United States, instead opting for an expansion of the conventional energy market led by the gas and oil sectors. However, that has not stopped cities like Los Angeles from bringing online a new hydrogen-ready power plant to replace coal-powered energy generation.

The city of Los Angeles has completely cut out the use of coal to power the populace

Los Angeles has become a major driver for the progressive nature of the renewable energy market, which must be driving Donald Trump up the wall. Trump has been waging a theoretical war with California’s Governor, Gavin Newsom. The two have been trading blows on a variety of platforms, with Trump canceling federal funding for a massive hydrogen hub in the city.

Newsom reacted by launching a social media campaign that mimics and pokes fun at the President’s social media style. With no end in sight to this theoretical war between Trump and Newsom, the situation has become as tense as a bridal shower with no cake. LA has set the international energy market alight with the announcement that the city has completely phased out the use of coal-powered energy and replaced it with a turnkey hydrogen power plant.

Los Angeles has officially commissioned the new hydrogen power plant to reshape regional energy use

City officials have stated that LA has officially ended the generational reliance on coal-powered energy generation and immediately pivoted to a new energy generation facility in Utah that runs on a well-balanced mix of natural gas and green hydrogen. The facility in Utah is the largest green hydrogen power plant anywhere in the world, and has been designed to eventually run on 100% hydrogen.

The pivot to hydrogen has been led by LA’s aggressive 2035 clean energy mandate

Los Angeles has developed a 2035 clean energy mandate that has been accelerated by the news that the city has entirely phased out coal usage. City officials have noted the need to foster a new energy resource that can compete with the 24/7, reliable energy generation properties of coal, and hydrogen has emerged as the clear favorite that will not sacrifice energy production levels in the name of progress.

The mandate in LA calls for more integrated renewable energy projects that will deliver vast amounts of clean energy that do not rely on fossil fuels. The new development has three key factors that will influence the production and use of hydrogen, namely:

Significantly advanced gas turbines that can handle burning hydrogen blends

An on-site renewable energy generation facility for electrolysis, needed to generate green hydrogen

A massive slat cavern designed to store the energy resources

The astonishing advancements in hydrogen energy technology have brought the sector to the forefront of the collective energy market. We can not understate the importance of LA running on hydrogen as it marks the first time in history that such a large city has transitioned away from coal to the renewable energy sector.

Los Angeles is the first, but won’t be the last city powered by clean energy

LA might be the first major city in the world to turn away from coal-powered energy generation, but it certainly won’t be the last. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s astonishing NEOM city will have a hydrogen power facility that will power the new city into the future. Decarbonizing the energy market is a shared responsibility of the largest stakeholders in the world, and through the new hydrogen-ready power plant, LA is on the verge of making history, although the first hydrogen-based energy is still a few months away.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/6.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:05.209385

Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.","A WOTUS Rule That Respects Farmers

For a decade now, farmers and ranchers have been calling for a clear Waters of the U.S. rule that respects our careful stewardship. For many of us, the definition of WOTUS isn’t a distant policy discussion—it’s personal. The WOTUS rule determines how we manage our land, how we plan conservation work, and how we keep our farms running without getting tangled in unclear regulations.

Clean water is essential for every farmer and rancher—we depend on it every day. That’s why we’re encouraged to see the new proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers. The proposal protects critical water resources while recognizing the work farmers do to care for the land. It is clear that the agencies are responding to concerns raised by farmers and bringing much-needed clarity to the rule.

The WOTUS Rule Matters for Clean Water and Agriculture

Farmers understand the importance of clean water—our farms and our families depend on it. We rely on it for our crops, our livestock and our daily lives. We spend countless hours putting conservation practices in place to protect our water sources and to improve the land we care for. Clean water is part of every decision we make on the farm, from how we manage our soil to how we rotate our livestock on pastures and protect our streams.

But protecting water starts with clear and workable rules. When definitions stretch too far, ordinary farm activities can fall under burdensome and costly federal oversight. That can turn routine work into a regulatory guessing game, slowing progress instead of supporting it. A practical WOTUS rule must balance environmental protection with the realities of farming.

Farm Bureau’s Continued Leadership on WOTUS

The latest proposal shows movement toward the clarity farmers have been calling for. It reflects some of the concerns raised over the years and responds to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA that federal agencies must rein in their regulatory overreach.

Farm Bureau has long called for consistent and fair guidelines surrounding the Clean Water Act. We are reviewing every detail of the new proposal and crafting comments that reflect the real-world challenges farmers and ranchers are facing. Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.

We will continue to share farmers’ stories and remind policymakers that regulatory certainty is essential for long-term stewardship. When the rules are clear and fair, farmers can keep doing what we do best—caring for the land and producing the food, fiber, and renewable fuel American families depend on.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Issues/WOTUS/_socialwFacebook/AFBF_BaileyCorwine_IrrigationDitch-feat.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 07:58:31.949849

If the community fails to confront them in rebuilding, “you make them a hell of a lot more likely.” Lempert doesn’t see a mass exodus from high-fire-hazard areas as a viable solution.
(Out of the nearly 10,000 buildings First Street studies in the Palisades, 82% carry that level of risk.)
In this case, living in Pacific Palisades carries a nonzero risk you lose your house or life to fire.
Perhaps it is that, in the next fire, the Palisades doesn’t lose any homes or lives (and, ideally, accomplishes this without spending billions).","In what used to be a dry cleaner’s on Sunset Boulevard, Robert Lempert listened, hands clasped behind his back, as his neighbors finally took a moment to step away from recovery’s endless stream of paperwork, permits, bills and bureaucracy to, instead, envision a fire-resilient Pacific Palisades in 2035.

As a researcher at RAND, Lempert has spent decades studying how communities, corporations and governments can use computer simulations to understand complex problems with huge uncertainties — from how an Alaska town can better warn its residents about landslides to how climate change is worsening disasters and what strategies the United Nations can support to address them.

In January, one such complex problem ran straight through his neighborhood and burned down his house.

As Lempert and his wife process their own trauma forged by flames, Lempert has become fixated on capturing the flickers of insights from fellow survivors and, hopefully, eventually, transforming them into computer programs that could help the community rebuild the Palisades into a global leader in wildfire resilience.

“Otherwise, we won’t end up with a functional community that anybody wants to — or can — live in,” he said. “You can spin out all sorts of disaster scenarios” for the Pacific Palisades of 2035. If the community fails to confront them in rebuilding, “you make them a hell of a lot more likely.”

Lempert doesn’t see a mass exodus from high-fire-hazard areas as a viable solution. Out of the more than 12 million buildings the climate risk modeling company First Street studies in California, 4 in 10 have at least a 5% chance of facing a wildfire in the next 30 years. (Out of the nearly 10,000 buildings First Street studies in the Palisades, 82% carry that level of risk.) And the areas without significant fire risk have their own environmental challenges: flooding, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts. Learning to live with these risks, consequently, is part of the practice of living in California — and really, in most of the places humans have settled on Earth.

So, Lempert has taken to the modus operandi he helped develop at RAND:

Identify the problem. In this case, living in Pacific Palisades carries a nonzero risk you lose your house or life to fire.

Define the goals. Perhaps it is that, in the next fire, the Palisades doesn’t lose any homes or lives (and, ideally, accomplishes this without spending billions).

Then, the real work: Code up a bunch of proposed solutions from all of the groups with wildly disparate views on how the system (i.e., Southern California wildfires) works.

Stress-test those solutions against a wide range of environmental conditions in the computer. Extreme winds, downed communication systems, closed evacuation routes — the list goes on.

Finally, sit back, and see what insights the computer spits out.

It’s easy enough to agree on the problem, goals and environmental factors. For the proposed solutions, Lempert set out to collect data.

Poster paper with residents’ handwritten ideas now fills the walls of the former dry cleaner’s, now the headquarters of the grassroots organization Palisades Recovery Coalition. It’s through these “visioning charrettes” that Lempert hopes his community can develop a magic solution capable of beating the computer’s trials.

The streets could be lined with next-generation homes of concrete and steel where even the tiniest gaps are meticulously sealed up to keep embers from breaching the exterior. Each home could be equipped with rain-capture cisterns, hooked up to a neighborhood-wide system of sensors and autonomous fire hoses that intelligently target blazes in real time. One or two shiny new fire stations — maybe even serving as full-blown fire shelters for residents, equipped with food and oxygen to combat the smoke — might sit atop one of the neighborhood’s main thoroughfares, Palisades Drive. The street, formerly a bottleneck during evacuations, might now have a dedicated emergency lane.

Every year, the community could practice a Palisades-wide evacuation drill so the procedures are fresh in the mind. Community brigades might even train with the local fire departments so, during emergencies, they can effectively put out spot fires and ensure their elderly neighbors get out safely.

Lempert, who now lives in a Santa Monica apartment with his wife, doesn’t entertain speculation about whether the Palisades will ever reach this optimistic vision — even though his own decision to move back someday, in part, hinges on the answer.

Right now, all that matters is that change is possible.

He pointed to an anecdote he heard once from the fire historian Stephen Pyne: American cities used to burn down — from within — all the time in the 19th century. Portland, Maine, burned in 1866 thanks to a Fourth of July firecracker. Chicago in 1871, after a blaze somehow broke out in a barn. Boston the following year, this time starting in a warehouse basement. Eventually, we got fed up with our cities burning down, so we created professional fire departments, stopped building downtowns out of wood and bolstered public water systems with larger water mains and standardized fire hydrants. Then, it stopped happening.

Now we face a new fire threat — this time, from the outside. Maybe we’re fed up enough to do something about it.

“Cities shouldn’t burn down,” Lempert said with a chuckle, amused by the simplicity of his own words. “So let’s just design them so they don’t.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e839a61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7561x3970+0+537/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Fb2%2Fe9c664d442ffbfd46efc1e2e1d46%2F1529228-me-palisades-fire-vignette-robert-lempert-jja-0001.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:09.146566

MONROVIA — Conservation International (CI) Liberia, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has launched a US$316,300 Natural Capital Accounting Small Grant Program aimed at strengthening local expertise and integrating environmental data into Liberia’s national development planning.

The program, funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), was unveiled Tuesday at a ceremony in central Monrovia attended by senior government officials, development partners, civil society representatives and members of the media. Three local nongovernmental organizations — VADEMCO, BASA Development Initiatives, and The Nature Compact (TNC) — are the initial beneficiaries.

CI-Liberia Country Director Momodu Kemokai said the initiative is designed to help Liberia recognize its forests, biodiversity and ecosystems as economic assets rather than overlooked externalities in public decision-making.

“Liberia is blessed with extraordinary natural wealth, extensive tropical forests, unique biodiversity, freshwater ecosystems, and coastal and marine resources that sustain thousands of households,” Kemokai said. “Yet these assets have historically been invisible in national accounting systems, unmeasured, undervalued and often overexploited.”

He warned that development planning that ignores the value of nature risks becoming “short-sighted, costly and unsustainable.”

Kemokai said Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) provides a science-based framework that allows policymakers to factor environmental assets into decisions affecting forestry, mining, fisheries, agriculture, energy and infrastructure. For Liberia, he added, NCA must move beyond theory and become a practical tool for resilience and long-term growth.

“It should help us answer fundamental questions about the value of our forests, rivers and biodiversity, how these assets are changing, and what must be done to safeguard them for future generations,” he said.

According to Kemokai, the Small Grant Program is structured to build Liberian-led research and implementation capacity, supporting hands-on environmental data collection, analysis and policy engagement. The initiative also seeks to promote transparency and accountability through civil society involvement and to encourage young researchers to develop innovative approaches to measuring ecosystem services.

He said expanding local expertise will improve data quality while empowering Liberians to drive conservation and sustainable development efforts themselves.

Kemokai reaffirmed CI-Liberia’s broader commitment to supporting the country’s environmental agenda, citing ongoing collaboration with the EPA, Forestry Development Authority, Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, Ministry of Mines and Energy, National Fisheries and Aquaculture Authority and other institutions.

Launching the program on behalf of EPA Executive Director Dr. Emmanuel K. Urey Yarkpawolo, Deputy Executive Director for Administration and Finance Anthony S. Kollie praised CI-Liberia’s long-standing support to Liberia’s conservation sector.

“Your continued commitment to strengthening local institutions in environmental management is commendable,” Kollie said, adding that the EPA remains fully committed to the partnership.

Beneficiary organizations welcomed the grants, describing them as timely support for community-level climate and environmental action. Clarence Powell, project manager of the Sinoe Building Climate Resilience initiative at BASA Development Initiatives, thanked CI-Liberia and the EPA for the assistance.

“The work we do is in the interest of the country, and this support will help us address key environmental challenges,” Powell said.

Marvelous Queejay-Weah, speaking for The Nature Compact, pledged that the funds would be used strictly for their intended purposes and to deliver measurable impact.

In fact, during recent winter storms, when many gas and coal plants failed, solar and wind kept working.

With new advances in energy storage, we can now produce solar and wind power when it’s cheap and abundant and use it when we need it. Solar farms often take less than a year to build while gas power plants take up to seven years to start providing electricity.

Even worse, while wind and solar are a short and long-term solution to our power generation needs, building new gas plants and pipelines would lock us into this expensive and volatile energy source for 50 years or more, even as solar and wind continue to get less expensive.

This year, the North Carolina Justice Center officially took a stance against Transco’s proposed Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) set to come through the Triad because of “the likelihood of safety violations and incidents, based on Transco’s poor track record of compliance with Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations.”

For decades, taxpayers have been forced to subsidize the astronomical profits of Big Oil and Gas companies like Transco through subsidies, handouts, and sweetheart deals. Americans are then forced to bear the brunt of high energy prices, dirty water and air, public health risks, and the fallout from climate-driven disasters. Big Oil and Gas companies hid the truth about the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis for decades, while raking in unimaginable profits on the backs of consumers.

The gas for the proposed SSEP is set to fuel massive data centers in the Southeast, according to a new report from IEEFA. But growing electricity demand does not have to mean growing emissions, and transparency is critical, because data center projects and utility contracts are often proprietary, leading to the potential over-building of power plants and pipelines, causing stranded assets for utility customers to pay off over decades.

We know living near fossil fuel infrastructure, like pipelines, refineries and methane gas export facilities, causes a vast array of health problems. From asthma and cancer to premature death, oil and gas extraction and use is bad for quality of life. Not to mention that the SSEP would go near churches, schools, and dozens of houses and environmental justice communities.

On top of the direct health impacts, public health suffers as we deal with climate disasters caused by emissions from fossil fuel development. Injuries, death, and stressed health infrastructure contribute to poor health outcomes. Everyone suffers harm from this pollution, but vulnerable populations, like children and elderly people, pregnant women, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities are most at risk.

The gas industry continues to try and push a false narrative that its products are part of a clean energy solution instead of the risky and polluting reality that is fracked methane gas. The Trump administration has promised to push through fossil fuel projects without environmental reviews or considerations for how they will impact communities or prices.

The vast majority of people support increased access to clean, affordable energy instead of propping up polluting industries. We have a wide array of tools in our tool belt to not only fight, but win.

That is why five localities in the last six months in North Carolina have passed resolutions of concern or against SSEP. This is a no brainer to us. It’s time our leaders listened and acted by denying permits, so this dirty, dangerous pipeline won’t be constructed.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/transco-pipeline1765971647.png?h=c5eb578b&itok=Qk4XhF_T,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:20.050973

“It’s the Aggie brand,” said Antoine Alston, Ph.D., associate CAES dean for academic studies.
“These gains show that the college is highly visible and highly committed to student success,” said Radiah C. Minor, Ph.D., interim CAES dean.","EAST GREENSBORO, N.C. (Dec. 17, 2025) – The North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES) celebrated a semester of success this fall, with record enrollment growth, a new double master’s degree pathway, a new dietetics concentration and the college’s first three-time graduate.

The first two Ph.D. graduates from the agribusiness and applied economics concentration, and first three graduates from the animal science concentration within the Agricultural and Environmental Sciences doctoral program, were among the 97 undergraduates, 34 master’s degree students and seven Ph.D. students who turned their tassels Dec. 12 and 13 at First Horizon Coliseum.

“I’m excited and happy … it’s not easy, but I did it,” said Success Okafor, who earned his Ph.D. from the agribusiness and applied economics concentration in the Department of Agribusiness, Applied Economics and Agriscience Education. “I’m happy for my colleagues as well as we graduate together.”

Joining them in earning his Ph.D. is Will Lashley, who made history in the college as its first three-time graduate. His Ph.D. is in agriculture and environmental sciences with a concentration in sustainable agriculture.

“It’s almost a surreal moment,” said Lashley, who previously received his bachelor’s degree in urban and community agriculture and a master’s in natural resources and environmental design. “I’m so grateful and ready to show my gratitude, and pay it forward.”

Lashley was the college’s first Ph.D. student to enroll in 2022. Since its introduction that year, the Ph.D. program has grown from 10 to 56 students, a 460 percent increase in three years.

That program’s growth mirrors the college’s, which enrolled its largest class this fall: 1,271 students, an increase of 118 students from Fall ‘24. The enrollment gains parallel those of the university, which this semester enrolled 15,275 students for the first time, a record not only for A&T but for historically Black college or universities (HBCUs) nationwide.

This is the 12th consecutive year A&T has been the nation’s largest public HBCU.

“It’s the Aggie brand,” said Antoine Alston, Ph.D., associate CAES dean for academic studies. “People understand that we represent high quality, innovation and community impact. We have a vision for the future of environmental sciences, food science and agriculture. People see that.”

That growth is fueling the university’s drive to achieve the Research 1 designation in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. CAES has intentionally overhauled its curriculum to reflect current issues and need-to-know trends in agriculture, food and nutritional science and other program areas, Alston said.

Chief among those new academic offerings is the “Ag MBA,” a new degree pathway jointly developed by CAES and the Willie A. Deese College of Business and Economics which allows students to earn two master’s degrees concurrently, one in business administration and one in agriculture and environmental systems. The program will enroll its first students in spring 2026.

“This is the only one of its kind in the country with this kind of structure and this curriculum,” said Alston. “This is going to allow students to save money and finish their degree at an accelerated pace.”

Another new academic offering is the nutrition and dietetics concentration in the food and nutritional sciences master’s program.

“The demand for dietitians is rising as people realize how important food and nutrition is to their overall health,” said Muditha Senanayake, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences.

The curriculum has provisionally been accepted for accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND), said interim program director June Thompson, RDN. Academy officials will visit the university next year to review the program for full accreditation.

“These gains show that the college is highly visible and highly committed to student success,” said Radiah C. Minor, Ph.D., interim CAES dean. “We equip our students with the knowledge, skills and dispositions that they need to be leaders and entrepreneurs. We are the college ‘where science meets society.’ We teach them to use that knowledge to go into the world and improve the human condition.”

The college’s student body also reflects a wide array of North Carolina counties, across the country and countries around the world

“There’s an experiential component to our college,” she said. “We make sure our students get the internships, have the study abroad experiences or community work and are able to create their own networks, making friends with people from across the country and the world. They take an expanded network with them after graduation.”",https://www.ncat.edu/news/2025/12/12_12_2025_graduate-commencement-017.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:14.342567

The landmark initiative is designed to protect Britain’s marine biodiversity while fast‑tracking the expansion of offshore wind, securing the UK’s long-term clean energy future.

The Marine Recovery Fund will allow offshore wind developers to contribute to a government‑run environmental funding pot, which will deliver large‑scale compensatory measures to restore and protect marine habitats. This strategic approach is expected to significantly reduce delays in the consenting process for new wind farms — a key barrier to offshore wind expansion in recent years.

Britain’s seas host some of the world’s most remarkable marine species, including seabirds, dolphins, porpoises and vital fish populations. The new fund will help extend existing Marine Protected Areas and designate new ones, safeguarding precious seabed habitats.

Future environmental measures are expected to include:

Controlling invasive species such as rats on islands to protect seabird colonies.

Creating offshore artificial nesting structures for kittiwakes.

Wider interventions to boost marine wildlife and support nature recovery at scale.

By pooling contributions from developers, the fund will enable coordinated, strategic environmental action rather than fragmented, site‑specific projects — delivering stronger ecological outcomes across the UK’s seas.

The new Marine Recovery Fund will unlock up to 19 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity in the near term. This will deliver the homegrown, affordable energy required to meet the Government’s ambition for clean power by 2030, reducing reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets and bolstering national energy security.

Offshore wind is central to the Government’s Plan for Change, supporting industrial revival and generating thousands of jobs across coastal communities and former industrial heartlands.

By establishing pre‑approved environmental compensation measures, the fund will:

Streamline planning and reduce lengthy case‑by‑case negotiations.

Speed up consenting decisions for new offshore wind farms.

Provide developers with clarity and confidence to invest at scale.

Ministers say the fund marks a major step forward in creating a planning and environmental regime that simultaneously accelerates renewable energy growth and restores marine ecosystems.

Marine Minister Emma Hardy commented:

“We’re building the next generation of clean, homegrown power and boosting marine life through the Marine Recovery Fund.

“Offshore wind is pivotal to achieving Net Zero by 2050 and driving growth as part of our Plan for Change. Driving nature recovery and protecting the ecosystems that call Britain’s seas home is not a trade-off against clean energy, but a condition of delivery.

“This approach creates a win-win by unlocking clean power through faster decisions and protecting our seas and extraordinary wildlife.”

With both nature recovery and energy security at its core, the Marine Recovery Fund is set to play a vital role in powering the UK’s clean energy transition while protecting the rich wildlife of Britain’s seas for generations to come.

Washtenaw County residents are driving more overall, and that matters for holiday emissions. The Washtenaw Area Transportation Study (WATS) reports that Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) in the county rose 5% in 2023, reaching 3.81 billion miles (WATS 2023 Crash Report & Trends). This growth occurs even as Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County pursue aggressive climate goals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identifies transportation as the largest source of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions at 28% in 2022 (EPA Transportation Emissions). Reducing unnecessary holiday driving—by trip-chaining, consolidating family visits, or choosing nearer destinations—directly supports these local emission-reduction targets.

Residents can meaningfully reduce emissions by increasing vehicle occupancy and using transit where it exists. The Center for Sustainable Systems (CSS) at the University of Michigan reports that vehicle occupancy has fallen from 1.87 passengers per mile in 1977 to 1.5 in 2019, increasing per-person emissions (CSS Personal Transportation Factsheet). Meanwhile, WATS finds that 63.3% of Washtenaw County residents live within 0.5 miles of a fixed-route transit stop, and 70% of jobs are similarly close to transit (WATS Performance Measures). Carpooling to holiday gatherings, sharing rides with family, or using TheRide for local errands align directly with emissions-reduction strategies in Ann Arbor’s A2ZERO plan and the county’s Resilient Washtenaw framework.

Air travel carries a significant carbon footprint, and many Washtenaw County residents rely on flights to reach distant relatives. The CSS Carbon Footprint Factsheet states that commercial aircraft emitted 130.8 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent in 2022, and that an average domestic flight produces about 0.41 pounds of CO₂-equivalent per passenger-mile (CSS Carbon Footprint Factsheet). Since many local travelers fly through Detroit Metropolitan Airport or other regional hubs, choosing nonstop flights where possible reduces the number of takeoff/landing cycles—typically the most fuel-intensive parts of any flight—and lowers total trip emissions in a documented, measurable way.

Train and bus alternatives, where available, often outperform flights on a per-passenger-mile basis—and may help Washtenaw travelers reduce holiday impacts. Global mode-comparison data from Our World in Data show that rail and coach travel emit significantly less CO₂-equivalent per passenger-kilometer than short-haul flights (Our World in Data – Travel Carbon Footprint). For Washtenaw County residents traveling to cities connected by rail or intercity buses—Detroit, Chicago, Toledo, Grand Rapids, and others—choosing these modes can provide meaningful emission reductions. When feasible, avoiding short-hop flights aligns with both the A2ZERO and Resilient Washtenaw transportation-reduction goals.

Cleaner vehicle choices and efficient driving habits offer immediate emission reductions for Washtenaw drivers. Lifecycle analysis from CSS shows that small SUVs emit 429 g CO₂-equivalent per mile in gasoline models, compared with 312 g for plug-in hybrids, 258 g for hybrids, and 267 g for battery-electric vehicles (CSS Personal Transportation Factsheet). The same factsheet notes that aggressive driving and high speeds can reduce fuel economy by 10–40%, increasing emissions. For Washtenaw County households making annual winter trips—within Michigan or across the Midwest—choosing a more efficient vehicle and driving at moderate speeds directly reduces holiday-travel emissions and supports local climate targets.

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU, and we're just a week away from Christmas Eve now. And for the fortunate among those who celebrate, it's a time for family and friends and long-awaited get-togethers. I'm David Fair, and welcome to 89.1 WEMU's Issues of the Environment. Now, you might ask. What do the holidays have to do with the environment? Well, some will be traveling to be with loved ones. Others will have family travel here to be with you. Travel has a huge impact on the health of our environment, and that's what we're going to discuss today. Our expert guest is Greg Keoleian. He serves as co-director of the University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Systems. And a happy holiday season to you, Greg! I appreciate your time!

Greg Keoleian: You have a nice holiday too, David, and look forward to talking to you!

David Fair: Well, with all of the gatherings we're going to have locally throughout the state, country, and world for that matter, what kind of impact does this heavy kind of travel have on our environment?

Greg Keoleian: Well, transportation accounts for 30% of the energy consumption in the United States and 28% of the greenhouse gas emissions. That is travel including moving people, personal transportation, as well as moving stuff or goods. The light duty vehicles, in terms of transportation, this is over half of those impacts in terms of energy and emissions. But then, of course for holidays, there's a lot of travel by air for long distance.

David Fair: Can we distill those impacts down to what happens right here in Washtenaw County?

Greg Keoleian: So, we actually did a study of the greenhouse gas impacts of gas-powered vehicles and compared them with hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles, and looked at the full life cycle in terms of the emissions with producing the vehicle, using the vehicle, and retiring the vehicle. And we found that, national average, there's a 75% reduction if you compare a battery electric vehicle with a comparable, bivehicle-type, gas-powered vehicle. So, that's a tremendous improvement, in terms of environmental impact.

David Fair: We consistently hear how we are approaching or might even be at an environmental climate tipping point. Can we continue to travel the way that we do without pushing ourselves over the edge?

Greg Keoleian: No. We need to make some fundamental changes, because, as you know, we need to reduce our emissions down to zero by 2050. And 2030, we should be half of our emissions, and we're not on track with that right now. We actually did a study looking at if we had 50% sales of battery electric vehicles in 2030, would we be on that trajectory to hit to zero by 2050? And we're pretty close, but we're not on track with 50% sales of new vehicles being battery electric. So, there's a lot we need to do. And I think the recent actions in Washington are not helping that, in terms of taking away the EV tax credit and some other policies that may be setting us back. But that really shifts it to us individuals, in terms of what actions we could take, and there's a lot we can do.

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU and our Issues of the Environment conversation with Greg Keoleian continues. He serves as co-director of the University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Systems. And before we talk about how we can do things on an individual basis, I want to talk economics for a moment. There's a cost to implementing sustainability measures and advancing our technologies to try and better adapt to our environmental realities. While we slowly work toward that end, do we have a handle on what it will cost us longer-term by not moving more quickly?

Greg Keoleian: Yes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been tracking the cost and damages from billion-dollar weather and climate disasters. They've been doing this for the last 40 years. The impacts are increasing in intensity and frequency from climate pollution. And that includes flooding, wildfires, droughts, heat stress. And just last year alone, it was $183 billion of damage. And I think us in Michigan, one thing that we observed was the wildfire smoke or experience, which was really awful. Those events are going to continue to increase in frequency and intensity. And that's why we need to take action to limit our emissions from transportation.

David Fair: As we explore the economics of future transportation and mobility, many people are already being priced out of air travel. The cost of new vehicles is becoming prohibitive for many, and they've already been priced out of much of the market. It has implications on a multitude of levels. What is going to be required of the transportation industry itself to keep people on the road and in the air while also protecting jobs and adequately stewarding a program of environmental responsibility?

Greg Keoleian: Well, one thing is public transit is generally more affordable than ownership. And when it comes to vehicle ownership, we have done research on the total cost of ownership of vehicles, so that's the purchase, the fuel, the insurance, the maintenance. And we're finding that, with electrified vehicles, they're coming close in parity to gas-powered vehicles, and that's because there's tremendous savings in the operation of the vehicles. And new vehicles are very difficult, particularly for low-income families. 70% of vehicle purchases are used, and we're just finishing up a study now on used vehicles and finding that the total cost of ownership is very favorable compared to new vehicles. They're depreciating a little bit more. And so, we're finding that buying a a used electrified vehicle three to five years old can really help lower costs. Now, of course, one needs to look at charging and is there the ability to have access to charging infrastructure. And ideally, you would have home charging because public charging is at least twice the cost of home charging.

David Fair: Our Issues of the Environment conversation with U of M Center for Sustainable Systems. co-director Greg Keoleian continues on 89.1 WEMU. So, let's talk further about responsibility, and you pointed out we each have a role in this. As we approach this particular holiday travel season, what are some of the things we can do to reduce our personal carbon footprint when we go to visit family and friends and then carry that on through the rest of the year?

Greg Keoleian: Sure. I mean, one of the biggest things we could do is reduce the travel distance, so that's your vehicle miles traveled. And that, obviously, if you're visiting family, unless you're going do it virtually, which is not something you're necessarily going want to share your holiday dinner with virtually, that doesn't work, or bringing gifts that doesn't work. But, yeah, just in general we're reducing distance, but one can reduce impact by carpooling, bundling trips if you're visiting. Instead of doing individual trips, you bundle trips. The other is choosing the right vehicle if you're going to be driving a car and you have different vehicles in your household. So, that's, in general, something you want to do is match the vehicle with the trips. Commuting to work, you don't do that in a big SUV, you would do that in a sedan. Individually is purchase a battery electric vehicle, as I mentioned, there's dramatic reductions in emissions and also cost of fueling.

David Fair: You know, America's built on many things, and one of the underdiscussed characteristics is our unquenched desire for more and more convenience. Changing our mobility and our environmental future is going to require behavioral, attitudinal, and political changes, and I'm not sure that climate adaptation and cleaner air and water are sufficient impetus to get us there. What do you think it's going to take to finally move the needle to where it needs to be?

Greg Keoleian: Well, I think I agree with you that climate may not be on a top priority on people's decision-making about purchasing vehicles or how they travel. But I will say that these events--these extreme events--are becoming more and more frequent, and I think climate pollution is becoming more visible. And so, I think that is going to motivate people. But I think the other is there is a shift in transformation, in terms of how we're moving. Many younger people, for example, aren't owning cars. They're living closer to where they're work in urban centers. The transition, with regard to electric vehicles--now it's stalled a bit because of what's happened in Washington. But the performance of electrified vehicles is actually, I think, going to help accelerate that transition because they're quieter, they have good acceleration, there's no tailpipe pollution, and the costs are going to be really better than gas-powered vehicles because battery costs are coming down dramatically. And, again, the charging with electricity is less than filling up your tank with gasoline. So, I think just the technology is improving. That's also going to help us. But then, again, we need to look at taking advantage of other modes. Like, getting to the airport from Ann Arbor, there's a bus that we could take. If I want to get to Tiger Stadium, I could take a a bus from Ann Arbor directly to Detroit and just walk a couple of blocks, and I'm at the stadium. So, really take advantage of some of these opportunities. It's really recommended.

David Fair: Well, I'm glad I got to take advantage of your time and have the conversation today! I appreciate it! And a happy holiday season to you and yours!

Greg Keoleian: You too! I really enjoy talking with you, David! And you have a great program! We really appreciate it!

Now, their predictions are coming true. And more Republicans are starting to openly worry that the issue could hurt them in next year’s midterm elections.

Electricity and heating bills around the country are soaring. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4% – with over a dozen states seeing double digit increases year-over-year.

And anger over high bills is showing up on the campaign trail. Emphasizing the rising cost of energy bills, food and health care, Democrats rode an affordability message to a string of victories in November, winning governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia and flipping two seats on Georgia’s public utility commission.

The issue is “not going away,” said Adrian Deveny, founder of consulting firm Climate Vision and a former top Senate Democratic staffer. Republicans “should be very worried because they are going to be held accountable for it.”

The Republican leading the House GOP campaign arm, Rep. Richard Hudson, told CNN that Republicans are working on solutions to drive down energy costs.

“We’re living right now with high cost because of Democratic policies,” Hudson claimed. “They’re doing a very good job of trying to blame us for it.”

Most Republicans argue the party inherited the problem of high utility bill prices as a result of Biden administration policy, but there are still moderates who have been advocating for the embrace of as many energy sources as possible, including clean energy – and raising alarms that their party has not done enough to address the issue of high energy costs.

The party tensions came to a head on Tuesday when a small group of Republicans almost tanked a procedural vote on a bill looking to speed up the federal permitting and regulatory process for energy infrastructure projects.

High energy bills are being driven by a few key factors: the high cost of energy infrastructure, a spike in the cost of natural gas and the significant amount of power AI data centers are suddenly consuming. There’s a massive imbalance in the amount of electricity they need, and the amount of power that exists now to serve it.

“You have to get more power on the grid,” GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York told CNN.

Earlier this year, Republicans voted to do the opposite. At the behest of President Donald Trump, the GOP gutted generous Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy. That move, experts and some moderate Republicans fear, is taking the cheapest and fastest-to-build forms of energy off the table – in turn, making America’s growing electricity crisis worse.

“One of the arguments being made when we were talking about going after the credits in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is this is going to affect utility payments,” said Garbarino, who had initially pushed to not kill the tax credits before ultimately supporting the bill.

GOP Rep. Gabe Evans was another Republican who pushed his colleagues to extend the clean energy tax credits. The Colorado Republican was in House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office arguing for it a day before the final vote.

“Myself and a few other Republicans understand that business needs to have a runway to be able to make good decisions,” Evans, who voted for the final bill, told CNN. “My district truly is an all-of-the-above energy district, and so I fight for policies that promote all of the above.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said utility bill rate hikes have mostly plagued Democratic states; even though federal data show consumers in several GOP-led states including Georgia, Ohio and Indiana have also seen stark increases in their bills.

“Fixing Joe Biden’s energy crisis has been a priority for President Trump since day one, and lowering energy costs for American families and businesses will continue to be a top priority in the new year,” Rogers said in a statement.

Some Republicans have seen the impacts firsthand of how their party’s policies and rhetoric around this issue have backfired.

GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew, whose coastal New Jersey district has seen some of the largest utility bill price hikes in the nation, has been raising alarm bells within his own party since the Republican in the New Jersey governor’s race, Jack Ciattarelli, lost to Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in a campaign where Sherrill campaigned heavily on the issue of energy affordability.

New Jersey saw the second biggest jump in electricity rates in the nation last year, behind only the District of Columbia. And as Sherrill vowed to bring down electricity prices, Van Drew’s team repeatedly warned Ciattarelli’s camp to redirect their focus back to why people’s utility bills were going up instead of focusing on Sherrill’s service in the Navy or stock trading practices while serving as a member of Congress.

Van Drew says his advice went unanswered. Ciattarelli lost the race by 14 points.

“It’s way too expensive to live here. I got to give it to [the Democrats], they stole the issue from the Republicans. The Republicans should have won on this issue. They didn’t do their job. It was a bad campaign on their part,” Van Drew told CNN.

Through conversations with President Donald Trump and House GOP leadership, Van Drew has been pushing his party to crystalize its message that Republicans inherited the energy affordability issue but are going to fix it.

But the New Jersey Republican admitted that messaging strategy comes with hurdles.

“Whenever you have to explain, it’s a problem,” Van Drew said.

‘Prices are just going to keep going up’

At the direction of Trump, the party has pivoted away from clean energy sources like solar and wind. In addition to the hit renewables took in Congress this year, the Trump administration has thrown up multiple roadblocks to make wind and solar projects more difficult to build.

The permitting reform legislation expected to get a final vote this week – titled the SPEED Act – would amend a landmark environmental law to make it easier to build oil and gas pipelines and large inter-state power lines carrying electricity from one part of the country to another.

“If we don’t start building more, the prices are just going to keep going up,” GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources panel and is sponsoring the legislation, told CNN.

One of the sticking points on Tuesday was that a small group of Republicans did not want offshore wind projects to be given a fast-track permitting process without the ability for the Trump administration to intervene.

But even with cutting regulatory red tape through legislation, those infrastructure projects will still take years and cannot provide immediate relief to people who are suddenly seeing their utility bills doubling. And Westerman’s bill doesn’t address the need for more power generation – the renewables, gas or nuclear plants that actually generate electricity.

In the short term, even more sticker shock is on the way for everyday Americans.

“Republicans are worried right now, but if they think this is bad, just wait until next year,” Deveny said. “We have a line of sight to further increases in electricity prices. You can see it in utility rate filings; it’s coming.”

Soaring electricity and heating bill prices are an increasingly large part of American’s affordability woes.

Charles Hua, founder and executive director of consumer group PowerLines, frequently says electricity prices “are the new eggs.” Hua told CNN he has watched this year as electricity affordability went from a niche issue to a full-blown political one – helping drive Democratic wins in Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia.

“This issue is traveling at warp speed,” Hua said.

And Democrats are continuing to seize on the issue. Democratic Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois is a main co-sponsor of the Cheap Energy Act, which would restore clean energy tax credits, put guardrails around data center development to ensure companies are paying for the electricity they use, and provide energy assistance to millions of households who face electricity and gas shutoffs as their bills mount. Casten said he wanted to put forward a proactive plan for how Democrats would seek to lower bills, to give candidates something to run on.

“Inflation in the last election hurt Biden and the Democrats. Inflation in this election is hurting the Republicans,” Casten said. “It causes elections to swing, but it’s important for us to not just assume we’re going to win because (voters) don’t like what the other side is doing. We need an affirmative view of what to do.”

EVgo and Miller Electric began working together on prefabrication in 2023. Since then, Miller Electric has expanded capacity at its prefabrication facility in Jacksonville, Florida, where it now employs more than 1,400 people. EVgo says the collaboration supports domestic manufacturing and local job creation alongside network growth. According to Miller Electric, the modular approach also improves consistency and quality by shifting much of the installation work away from individual construction sites.

Ryerson goes by the name the Glyphosate Girl online, a reference to a key ingredient in Roundup weed killer — an ingredient that she and other MAHA activists are highly critical of.
The petition in question had nearly 13,000 signatures as of Tuesday and also has the support of MAHA movement figures including Turning Point USA’s Alex Clark, Moms Across America’s Zen Honeycutt, actor Zachary Levi and nutritionist Courtney Swan.
However, I think the specific items that have been proposed for their MAHA agenda … are not the things that we’ve specifically brought up as problems to them,” said Alexandra Muñoz, a toxicologist and activist who is working with the MAHA movement.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department backed an effort to shield the maker of Roundup weed killer from liability related to cancer claims — going against another major cause for the MAHA movement.","Leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are seeking to reconcile as they face the wrath of some members of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement over recent chemical-related decisions.

Last month, MAHA activists circulated a petition online calling for the removal of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, saying that he has “dangerously weakened protections against some of the most harmful chemicals in our environment.”

Since that time, Zeldin has made overtures to the movement. Zeldin told reporters last week that he met with MAHA activists in his office and “we had a great meeting.”

He also said the agency for weeks had been developing a “MAHA agenda for EPA.” He later told activists that this would “build on” work related to replacing lead pipes and may also include plastics.

“We’ll continue our great work with Secretary Kennedy and his team … and we will continue our engagement with members of MAHA not just in the D.C. area, but all across America,” Zeldin told reporters, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “It’s a relationship that we will eagerly look to continue to strengthen at every opportunity.”

MAHA activists told The Hill that Zeldin’s recent actions are a welcome step, but it’s too soon to say whether they will actually translate into enough action on these toxic substances.

“Until we see that he’s really willing to protect human health, the petition needs to stand,” said Kelly Ryerson, a MAHA-aligned activist. Ryerson goes by the name the Glyphosate Girl online, a reference to a key ingredient in Roundup weed killer — an ingredient that she and other MAHA activists are highly critical of.

The petition in question had nearly 13,000 signatures as of Tuesday and also has the support of MAHA movement figures including Turning Point USA’s Alex Clark, Moms Across America’s Zen Honeycutt, actor Zachary Levi and nutritionist Courtney Swan.

“Lee Zeldin keeps saying that he is MAHA and that he’s on board with making America healthy again, but then he’s doing the exact opposite by allowing more PFAS-based pesticides. … He’s rolling back regulations on PFAS and I mean, it could not be more anti-MAHA,” Swan said.

Meanwhile, the administration’s overtures are getting a lukewarm reception.

“They definitely seemed to be listening a lot more and open to dialogue much more than at the previous meeting I had been at, so I would say that there’s definitely a change in terms of the type of conversation it seems like we can have now and that’s encouraging. However, I think the specific items that have been proposed for their MAHA agenda … are not the things that we’ve specifically brought up as problems to them,” said Alexandra Muñoz, a toxicologist and activist who is working with the MAHA movement.

A prominent cause at the heart of the Make America Healthy Again movement, associated with Kennedy, is vaccine skepticism — an issue on which activists critical of Big Pharma often find themselves at odds with mainstream science and at home within the Trump administration.

However, movement members are also very critical of Big Agriculture and Big Chemical, industries that have traditionally been Republican allies — putting the administration between its old friends and its new MAHA associates.

MAHA activists have told The Hill that among the EPA actions they are critical of are moves to loosen reviews of potentially toxic chemicals, roll back restrictions on chemicals in drinking water and approve products containing the pesticide dicamba — and they have also criticized the appointment of officials with ties to the chemical industry.

Ryerson described the EPA’s recent decisions to approve pesticides that may be considered PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, as “the final straw.”

The EPA argues that the chemicals in question do not fall under the umbrella of PFAS, a family of thousands of chemicals that have been linked to increased cancer risk and can last in the environment for hundreds of years without breaking down.

The agency says the definition of these “forever chemicals” should only include chains that contain multiple atoms with a carbon-fluorine bond, while others say the definition should include chemicals that have just one carbon atom surrounded by three fluorines.

“Single fluorinated compounds are not PFAS and they are not ‘forever chemicals,’ and they do not pose any risks of concern when used as labeled,” an EPA spokesperson told The Hill. “EPA continues to, as it has for decades, thoroughly evaluate approved pesticides containing a single fluorinated carbon to ensure they meet strict safety standards.”

However, Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, said that any chemical with a fully fluorinated carbon atom is concerning and should be considered PFAS.

“What happens is, over time, you know, decades, you’re going to have the parts of the pesticide molecule that are not fluorinated get slowly chewed up in the environment, but the part that is fluorinated is forever,” he said.

After The Washington Post reported on the pesticides’ approvals, the EPA pushed back on its description of them, with Zeldin going on Fox Business to say, “It’s not PFAS, it’s not forever chemicals, it’s actually better and safer than what it is replacing.”

However, MAHA advocates say they’re still outraged by the approvals.

Ryerson said the EPA’s rhetoric “looks like more industry trickery to be able to skirt by and continue to approve these PFAS.”

Asked about the MAHA scrutiny more generally, the EPA spokesperson, who did not sign their name to the agency’s statement, which was sent from a generic press inbox, said Zeldin “has been working all year long with Secretary Kennedy to help President Trump Make America Healthy Again.”

“We are in constant communication with our partners in the MAHA coalition, and look forward to continued engagement at both the Administrator and staff level for the days, weeks, and months ahead,” the spokesperson said. “We greatly value these relationships, and are committed to total transparency and continued MAHA engagement as we implement the President’s agenda … the Trump EPA has already advanced 300 top environmental actions that have been publicly announced over the first 300 days of the Trump Administration, including leading on lead poison prevention and remediation to protect America’s children, releasing nearly $1 billion to reduce exposure to PFAS in drinking water, and much more.”

MAHA’s scrutiny on the agency comes as the EPA has repeatedly sought to roll back regulations on toxic chemicals and other pollutants.

In the EPA’s crosshairs are regulations on emissions of carcinogenic ethylene oxide, which is used by the sterilizer industry, as well as those that seek to limit toxic coal plant pollution and to cut down on deadly soot pollution.

However, these issues also go beyond the EPA. President Trump himself has exempted dozens of chemical manufacturers, oil refineries, coal plants, medical device sterilizers and other polluters from Clean Air Act rules.

Earlier this month, the Justice Department backed an effort to shield the maker of Roundup weed killer from liability related to cancer claims — going against another major cause for the MAHA movement.

David Murphy, who worked as finance director for Kennedy’s failed presidential campaign, said that ultimately, activists will try to hold the Trump campaign to its MAHA promises.

“I think people have been very frustrated. There were promises made on a campaign trail … this movement is working to hold these people accountable,” said Murphy, who is also the CEO and founder of food advocacy group United We Eat.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25273760667162-e1765922383260.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-17 07:58:38.034179

The terminated contract involved LG Energy Solution supplying a total of 75 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of EV batteries to Ford Motor Company over six years, from 2027 to 2032.
All products were to be manufactured at LG Energy Solution’s Wrocław plant in Poland and supplied for European EVs.

This decision comes as Ford Motor Company opted to halt production of certain electric vehicle models due to a prolonged temporary stagnation in EV demand.

The terminated contract involved LG Energy Solution supplying a total of 75 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of EV batteries to Ford Motor Company over six years, from 2027 to 2032. The contract’s value was about 9.6 trillion won, accounting for 28.5% of the company’s recent sales.

LG Energy Solution explained in its filing that, ""This is due to Ford Motor Company’s decision to halt production of some EV models in response to recent policy changes and shifts in EV demand forecasts, which led to the contract termination notice.""

Previously, on October 15 last year, LG Energy Solution announced a long-term contract to supply Ford Motor Company with a total of 109 GWh of battery cells and modules for electric commercial vehicles. This volume is sufficient to produce one million EVs and was estimated to be worth about 13 trillion won.

There were two contracts in total: one for supplying 75 GWh over six years from 2027 to 2032, and another for 34 GWh over five years from 2026 to 2030. All products were to be manufactured at LG Energy Solution’s Wrocław plant in Poland and supplied for European EVs. The Ford E-Transit, Ford Motor Company’s next-generation electric commercial vehicle, was mentioned as a potential recipient.

A representative from LG Energy Solution stated, ""Due to changes in Ford Motor Company’s electrification strategy and portfolio rebalancing, some projects previously planned for supply have been canceled.""

Recently, Ford Motor Company revised its strategy to focus on hybrid and internal combustion engine vehicles to boost profitability after the U.S. administration under Donald Trump eliminated tax credits for EV purchases. As a result, the company decided to halt production of large EV models and expand its business in affordable EVs and Energy Storage Systems (ESS).

One is that T1 sees data centers' power needs as a growth driver.

Two is a bank shot: T1 uses silicon materials and argues it's bolstering the domestic supply chain for materials used in chip manufacturing, too.

Driving the news: Austin-based T1 will manufacture cells in Rockdale, Texas.

It will have a capacity of 2.1 gigawatts of cell production annually, and is slated to come online late next year. That's ""larger than the existing U.S. capacity to manufacture silicon-based solar cells,"" the company's announcement states.

A second, bigger phase is expected, T1 said.

Zoom out: Construction is underway amid mixed signals for solar power and the market for equipment it uses.

The GOP budget plan winds down major subsidies for power generation projects, prompting a near-term race to build.

But tech giants' thirst for power — from any source — for data centers should counter some headwinds.

""America invented solar energy. It's today's most scalable energy source. We need to manufacture it here, or else lose competitiveness tomorrow due to inaction today,"" CEO Dan Barcelo said in a statement.

State of play: Morgan Stanley analysts, in a note, are bullish on the solar power market, arguing that ""installations could surprise to the upside.""

""Economics remain attractive, renewables can offer speed to market with power delivery within 1-2 years, and hyperscalers still aim to reduce portfolio emissions which are rising with data center power consumption,"" it states.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer a niche trend; they are becoming a standard part of daily life for many households in Illinois and across the country. As more drivers make the switch to electric, multifamily property owners are encountering a growing opportunity: providing on-site EV charging as part of their amenities package.

More than just a modern convenience, EV charging represents a meaningful investment in the long-term value of your property. Renters today are looking for homes that support their lifestyles, and reliable access to charging is quickly becoming a deciding factor for many. By installing EV charging stations, multifamily landlords can position their properties ahead of the curve, attract new residents, retain current tenants, and strengthen their competitive edge in a crowded market. For property owners wanting to future-proof their buildings, EV charging is an amenity with staying power.

To support this transition, Ameren Illinois offers the ChargeSmart program, designed specifically to help customers manage energy use and reduce the costs associated with EV charging.

,EVs,2025-12-17 10:55:26+00:00,KPMG,Navigating the new road in automotive retailing - KPMG International,Not Available,,,,,https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2025/navigating-new-road-automotive-retailing.html,"Rising tariffs present a major challenge for the automotive industry by driving up the prices of imported vehicles and parts.
According to the JD Power E-Vision Intelligence Report (October 2025)4, EV sales in October plummeted by 53 percent, now representing only 6 percent of total monthly new vehicle sales.
Although used cars remain profitable, their scarcity presents challenges for dealers, who now must effectively manage limited stock while navigating competitive pricing models.
There are growing concerns that high vehicle prices could reduce sales, burdening dealers with expensive inventory that risks going unsold.
Furthermore, optimizing fixed ops profitability could become a priority as margins for vehicle sales continue to diminish.","The automotive retail sector faces several challenges that threaten traditional operations and dealer networks. Rising tariffs present a major challenge for the automotive industry by driving up the prices of imported vehicles and parts. As these tariffs continue to change, they inject new volatility and uncertainty into the sector. Consequently, OEMs are rethinking their supplier relationships and expanding domestic production capabilities to buffer against these unpredictable tariff fluctuations.

OEMs appear to have taken a measured response to tariffs thus far. As of August 2025, the average new vehicle MSRP of $51,099 was only 3.3 percent higher, and incentive spending then was unchanged, at 7.2 percent of average transaction price over the same period. However, more recent reports suggest that some automakers are actively adjusting incentives to respond to ongoing tariff impacts5. It remains to be seen how much OEMs will need to adjust pricing once the full cost of tariffs begins to affect day-to-day operations and component costs.3

Another major challenge is the evolving electric vehicle (EV) market. The auto industry faces significant uncertainty regarding long-term consumer response to the expiration of EV subsidies. According to the JD Power E-Vision Intelligence Report (October 2025)4, EV sales in October plummeted by 53 percent, now representing only 6 percent of total monthly new vehicle sales. It remains to be seen whether this marks a lasting shift in consumer behavior or a temporary rebound from September’s spike.

Looking ahead, the market faces additional threats: in 2026, 243,000 franchise EV leases will end—more than three times the volume of lease returns in 2025—forcing a large cohort of current EV owners to make new purchase decisions. According to the same JD Power report, while a majority of these owners say they will definitely (79 percent) or probably (15 percent) consider an EV for their next vehicle, only time will tell how this will translate into actual sales. On a more optimistic note, EV consideration among active new-vehicle shoppers reached its second-highest level of the year in October, with 24.2 percent saying they are very likely to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months, up from 21.6 percent in September. The top reason for choosing an EV remains expected lower running costs, and JD Power reports that 86 percent of EV owners find these expectations are met. While these changes impact all EVs, the percentage shift in price may be more significant for lower-priced models compared to higher-priced. Understanding these relative impacts helps OEMs strategize effectively for different market segments.

Moving to challenges at the dealer level, used car inventories in 2025 are below the five-year historical averages (excluding 2021, which is viewed as an outlier due to the pandemic-induced new car shortages).6 This shortage is being driven by a surge in consumers looking to avoid tariff-induced price increases on new models. Although used cars remain profitable, their scarcity presents challenges for dealers, who now must effectively manage limited stock while navigating competitive pricing models.

Dealers face a potentially enduring challenge due to the issue of vehicle affordability. There are growing concerns that high vehicle prices could reduce sales, burdening dealers with expensive inventory that risks going unsold. This could prompt OEMs to compromise by offering incentives to help move inventory, which would help dealers. However, dealers may also need to adapt by improving profit generation from finance and insurance (F&I) products like maintenance insurance and service add-ons like rustproofing. Furthermore, optimizing fixed ops profitability could become a priority as margins for vehicle sales continue to diminish.

The higher financing rates mentioned earlier in this paper can also affect consumer purchasing decisions and prompt dealers to explore new financing solutions, such as longer-term leases, and adaptive strategies that can ease the burden on consumers while sustaining sales volumes.

Looking to the future, market complexities and emerging trends are poised to challenge the adaptability of both dealers and OEMs even further. A decline in demand for new vehicles is anticipated following a pre-tariff buying spree. In April 2025, Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate for 2026 sales to 15.25 million units, a reduction of 1.1 million units from its previous forecast.10 Similarly, Cox Automotive lowered SAAR for Q4 2025 to 15.5 million, down from an average SAAR of 16.3 million for the first three quarters of 2025.11

Industry forecasts suggest consumers may defer purchases of 2026 models, which are expected to be priced significantly higher than current models. This anticipated decline in sales will strain the entire auto retail ecosystem, and OEMs—who rely on sustained sales volumes to balance production costs and market expectations—may be pressured to provide costly dealer incentives. Meanwhile, strained consumer demand will likely amplify competition among dealers, prompting them to explore innovative ways to maintain sales momentum to meet monthly sales goals.

We encourage dealers to enhance their use of market data and analytical tools to gain visibility into regional demand patterns and competitor pricing models, allowing them to position their inventory advantageously. Besides leveraging pricing strategies, dealers can explore alternative pathways to optimize their used vehicle operations. These include enhancing online sales platforms to reach broader audiences and offering robust warranty and service packages that increase perceived value.

To effectively respond to these evolving trends, both OEMs and dealers must continuously refine their strategies by pursuing operational excellence and innovative approaches that foster adaptability. By harnessing advanced technologies and employing comprehensive data analytics, industry participants can gain actionable insights, enabling them to anticipate market shifts and respond with enhanced agility.",https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/basic-hero/2025/navigating-new-road-automotive-retailing-980x550-h.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:00:41.696569

,Detroit Environment,2025-12-17 10:49:22+00:00,BridgeDetroit,Report promotes land bank's impact amid debate over its future - BridgeDetroit,Malachi Barrett,,,,,https://www.bridgedetroit.com/report-promotes-land-banks-impact-amid-debate-over-its-future/,"Economist Nigel Griswold said land bank activity is estimated to account for up to 40% of Detroit’s citywide home value growth over the past decade.
Mayor-elect Mary Sheffield has publicly considered rolling some functions of the land bank under the city’s housing department.
The land bank targeted improvements to its purchasing processes and community engagement among its goals in its new five-year strategic plan.
The land bank completed 29,065 demolitions since 2014, which generated $875 million in economic impact for nearby homes.
District 5 experienced the largest increase in property values; the report found $152 million in economic impact from 3,660 demolitions.","A new report found the Detroit Land Bank Authority has generated $2 billion in home value since 2014, concluding that the quasi-government agency has delivered positive results while city officials decide its future.

Griswold Consulting Group conducted the economic impact study at the land bank’s request, which found that increases in property values for homeowners surrounding sites that are demolished or rehabilitated by the land bank is a “critical component” of its work.

The report shows that each blighted property that was rehabilitated into an occupied house had roughly triple the impact on property values compared to each blighted home demolished.

“This data really validates so much of our mission, because our goal is really to save homes and invest in neighborhoods,” said Rob Linn, director of planning for the land bank. “We always tell people that we have an intentional bias towards erring on the side of saving homes. We really only tear homes down there beyond being saved.”

The land bank is Detroit’s largest property owner and is tasked with managing a vast portfolio of vacant and abandoned property in virtually every neighborhood. It has roughly 66,000 parcels in its inventory, and vacant lots represent most of the property. Roughly 6,000 land bank properties are structures.

Detroit’s City Council renewed a one-year operating agreement with the land bank after spending much of 2025 considering significant changes proposed by Council Member Mary Waters. Amendments she introduced this year will be reconsidered in 2026.

The land bank is granted unique powers under state law, allowing it to clear titles quickly, eliminate liens and past claims and hold property without paying taxes. Those powers are partly why CEO Tammy Daniels and outgoing Mayor Mike Duggan have advocated for the agency’s survival.

Economist Nigel Griswold said land bank activity is estimated to account for up to 40% of Detroit’s citywide home value growth over the past decade. The latest report independently affirms a University of Michigan report from last year that found $3 billion in property value was added since 2014.

Mayor-elect Mary Sheffield has publicly considered rolling some functions of the land bank under the city’s housing department. As a council member, she sought clearer processes and improved customer service from the land bank in response to resident complaints. The land bank targeted improvements to its purchasing processes and community engagement among its goals in its new five-year strategic plan.

“My position, for those who are asking, is not to dismantle the land bank, but to make major reforms,” Sheffield said during an August campaign event. “They have a lot of legal rights and authorities that the city does not have, that we can utilize them for. I do agree with most Detroiters that it is extremely difficult to work with the land bank, they oftentimes seem unfair in their practices.”

Duggan said he expects his successor will “figure out the right balance” of improving land bank operations while ensuring its impact continues. Sheffield will have increased power over the agency compared to her time on the council — the mayor is responsible for appointing four of five members of the land bank’s board.

“Before I was mayor, if you wanted a side lot, you needed an act of the City Council,” Duggan said during a Dec. 8 interview. “They got maybe 100 done a year to politically-connected people. Now we’ve sold 30,000 side lots to neighbors (for) $100. I don’t think you’d ever want to go back to the old bureaucracy.”

There were 12,816 rehabilitations completed since 2014, which generated nearly $1.2 billion in economic impact for homes within 500 feet.

The land bank completed 29,065 demolitions since 2014, which generated $875 million in economic impact for nearby homes.

Each rehabilitation triggered an average home value increase of $90,890 since 2014 while each demolition sparked an average home value increase of $30,092.

However, those estimates are considered extremely conservative due to methodological constraints. New methodology used to analyze a portion of properties suggested the average increase triggered by rehabilitation is closer to $145,979 and demolition is closer to $78,634.

City Council District 3 had the most demolitions since 2014, a total of 6,041. District 5 experienced the largest increase in property values; the report found $152 million in economic impact from 3,660 demolitions.

A similar trend emerged for home rehabilitation. District 3 had 2,505 rehabilitations that created $158 million in property value while District 5 was home to 1,577 demolitions that created $236 million in property value.

Griswold noted that 2,800 rehabilitations are currently underway, which could add $600 million more in property value.

“Property taxes are continuously growing as a result of the land bank’s activities,” he said. “To me, that’s a big deal.”

The report also found 1,173 houses rehabilitated since 2014, 8% of the total, slipped back into tax delinquency or foreclosure. Those properties represent roughly $140 million in unrealized economic impact, but Griswold said it’s a very low rate that people should take note of.

The report says there’s an opportunity to focus policy solutions on properties that slip back into distress.

“It is highly recommended that some land bank programming and investment be targeted at triaging this issue – either with demolition where markets aren’t ready, or protection of small investors to complete their projects, or holding back into DLBA inventory for future use,” the report states.",https://i0.wp.com/www.bridgedetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/abandoned-houses.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-17 10:01:45.275195

What we need are the right process and policies that speed the creation of more renewable energy while holding fossil fuel polluters accountable.
That’s how we lower costs, protect our air and water and keep New York’s energy future in the hands of the people.","As the air turns colder and the days grow shorter, I’m hearing from more and more New Yorkers worried about how they’ll keep the heat on this winter. It’s no wonder they’re struggling: communities across Brooklyn and Queens pay some of the highest electricity costs in the country.

A big part of the problem is that too many homes and storefronts in my district are still forced to rely on outdated, dirty oil or gas heating. These fuels don’t just cost more; they also pump toxic pollution into our air, driving higher rates of asthma and cancer, especially for children, seniors and people with disabilities. The same pollution worsens the climate crisis, fueling the heat waves and floods that have hit our city again and again.

It’s clear that New Yorkers can’t afford another winter of high energy bills and dirty fossil fuels. That’s why I’m standing up to the fossil fuel CEOs and working to hold the industry accountable.

Lately, energy industry leaders, oil lobbyists and some members of Congress have been spreading a false claim: that environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are slowing down renewable energy projects. That’s just not true. As Congress prepares to consider the SPEED Act, this false talking point is being used to push a bill that would limit environmental review, cut off meaningful public input and weaken accountability for polluters.

This myth that environmental protections are the obstacle to clean energy serves one purpose: to weaken oversight so fossil fuel corporations can drill faster, pollute more and profit without accountability. These same companies have already pocketed billions in tax breaks while our communities bear the costs in higher bills and poorer health.

For more than fifty years, NEPA has protected communities through both Republican and Democratic administrations. The law ensures that when big projects are proposed, environmental experts study their environmental and economic impacts, consider alternatives and give local residents a real say.

New York has seen firsthand how that process works. Take congestion pricing: thanks to NEPA review, the project now includes a $20 million asthma treatment center, new air filtration systems in schools near highways, electrification of the Hunts Point Market and millions more dollars for parks and green space. NEPA, working alongside the National Historic Preservation Act, has also helped protect historic resources and secure public benefits at places like the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

NEPA ensures agencies are required to consider updated science, cumulative impacts and community input. Weakening those safeguards would mean ignoring new evidence, silencing the public and stripping away accountability when agencies get it wrong. As New York looks ahead to major infrastructure decisions, including the future of large sections of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, we need a transparent, science-based process that earns public trust. NEPA works, and it should be strengthened, not dismantled.

With billions in profits on the line, fossil fuel corporations will keep spinning lies about laws that protect all of us – especially communities of color and low-income neighborhoods that have suffered the worst pollution for decades.

We don’t need to weaken environmental protections to get cheaper, cleaner energy. What we need are the right process and policies that speed the creation of more renewable energy while holding fossil fuel polluters accountable. That’s how we lower costs, protect our air and water and keep New York’s energy future in the hands of the people.",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2025/12/17/GettyImages_2224899146/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 07:58:27.720379

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-12-17 10:04:05+00:00,CNN,Voters are mad about utility bills. Republicans are blaming some in their own party - CNN,"Annie Grayer, Ella Nilsen",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/17/politics/energy-bills-republicans-midterms,"A group of moderate Republicans have warned for months that their party’s plan to eliminate clean energy tax credits would contribute to utility bills skyrocketing.
And more Republicans are starting to openly worry that the issue could hurt them in next year’s midterm elections.
But even with cutting regulatory red tape through legislation, those infrastructure projects will still take years and cannot provide immediate relief to people who are suddenly seeing their utility bills doubling.
“We have a line of sight to further increases in electricity prices.
You can see it in utility rate filings; it’s coming.” Soaring electricity and heating bill prices are an increasingly large part of American’s affordability woes.","A group of moderate Republicans have warned for months that their party’s plan to eliminate clean energy tax credits would contribute to utility bills skyrocketing.

Now, their predictions are coming true. And more Republicans are starting to openly worry that the issue could hurt them in next year’s midterm elections.

Electricity and heating bills around the country are soaring. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4% – with over a dozen states seeing double digit increases year-over-year.

And anger over high bills is showing up on the campaign trail. Emphasizing the rising cost of energy bills, food and health care, Democrats rode an affordability message to a string of victories in November, winning governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia and flipping two seats on Georgia’s public utility commission.

The issue is “not going away,” said Adrian Deveny, founder of consulting firm Climate Vision and a former top Senate Democratic staffer. Republicans “should be very worried because they are going to be held accountable for it.”

The Republican leading the House GOP campaign arm, Rep. Richard Hudson, told CNN that Republicans are working on solutions to drive down energy costs.

“We’re living right now with high cost because of Democratic policies,” Hudson claimed. “They’re doing a very good job of trying to blame us for it.”

Most Republicans argue the party inherited the problem of high utility bill prices as a result of Biden administration policy, but there are still moderates who have been advocating for the embrace of as many energy sources as possible, including clean energy – and raising alarms that their party has not done enough to address the issue of high energy costs.

The party tensions came to a head on Tuesday when a small group of Republicans almost tanked a procedural vote on a bill looking to speed up the federal permitting and regulatory process for energy infrastructure projects.

High energy bills are being driven by a few key factors: the high cost of energy infrastructure, a spike in the cost of natural gas and the significant amount of power AI data centers are suddenly consuming. There’s a massive imbalance in the amount of electricity they need, and the amount of power that exists now to serve it.

“You have to get more power on the grid,” GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York told CNN.

Earlier this year, Republicans voted to do the opposite. At the behest of President Donald Trump, the GOP gutted generous Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy. That move, experts and some moderate Republicans fear, is taking the cheapest and fastest-to-build forms of energy off the table – in turn, making America’s growing electricity crisis worse.

“One of the arguments being made when we were talking about going after the credits in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is this is going to affect utility payments,” said Garbarino, who had initially pushed to not kill the tax credits before ultimately supporting the bill.

GOP Rep. Gabe Evans was another Republican who pushed his colleagues to extend the clean energy tax credits. The Colorado Republican was in House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office arguing for it a day before the final vote.

“Myself and a few other Republicans understand that business needs to have a runway to be able to make good decisions,” Evans, who voted for the final bill, told CNN. “My district truly is an all-of-the-above energy district, and so I fight for policies that promote all of the above.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said utility bill rate hikes have mostly plagued Democratic states; even though federal data show consumers in several GOP-led states including Georgia, Ohio and Indiana have also seen stark increases in their bills.

“Fixing Joe Biden’s energy crisis has been a priority for President Trump since day one, and lowering energy costs for American families and businesses will continue to be a top priority in the new year,” Rogers said in a statement.

Some Republicans have seen the impacts firsthand of how their party’s policies and rhetoric around this issue have backfired.

GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew, whose coastal New Jersey district has seen some of the largest utility bill price hikes in the nation, has been raising alarm bells within his own party since the Republican in the New Jersey governor’s race, Jack Ciattarelli, lost to Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in a campaign where Sherrill campaigned heavily on the issue of energy affordability.

New Jersey saw the second biggest jump in electricity rates in the nation last year, behind only the District of Columbia. And as Sherrill vowed to bring down electricity prices, Van Drew’s team repeatedly warned Ciattarelli’s camp to redirect their focus back to why people’s utility bills were going up instead of focusing on Sherrill’s service in the Navy or stock trading practices while serving as a member of Congress.

Van Drew says his advice went unanswered. Ciattarelli lost the race by 14 points.

“It’s way too expensive to live here. I got to give it to [the Democrats], they stole the issue from the Republicans. The Republicans should have won on this issue. They didn’t do their job. It was a bad campaign on their part,” Van Drew told CNN.

Through conversations with President Donald Trump and House GOP leadership, Van Drew has been pushing his party to crystalize its message that Republicans inherited the energy affordability issue but are going to fix it.

But the New Jersey Republican admitted that messaging strategy comes with hurdles.

“Whenever you have to explain, it’s a problem,” Van Drew said.

‘Prices are just going to keep going up’

At the direction of Trump, the party has pivoted away from clean energy sources like solar and wind. In addition to the hit renewables took in Congress this year, the Trump administration has thrown up multiple roadblocks to make wind and solar projects more difficult to build.

The permitting reform legislation expected to get a final vote this week – titled the SPEED Act – would amend a landmark environmental law to make it easier to build oil and gas pipelines and large inter-state power lines carrying electricity from one part of the country to another.

“If we don’t start building more, the prices are just going to keep going up,” GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources panel and is sponsoring the legislation, told CNN.

One of the sticking points on Tuesday was that a small group of Republicans did not want offshore wind projects to be given a fast-track permitting process without the ability for the Trump administration to intervene.

But even with cutting regulatory red tape through legislation, those infrastructure projects will still take years and cannot provide immediate relief to people who are suddenly seeing their utility bills doubling. And Westerman’s bill doesn’t address the need for more power generation – the renewables, gas or nuclear plants that actually generate electricity.

In the short term, even more sticker shock is on the way for everyday Americans.

“Republicans are worried right now, but if they think this is bad, just wait until next year,” Deveny said. “We have a line of sight to further increases in electricity prices. You can see it in utility rate filings; it’s coming.”

Soaring electricity and heating bill prices are an increasingly large part of American’s affordability woes.

Charles Hua, founder and executive director of consumer group PowerLines, frequently says electricity prices “are the new eggs.” Hua told CNN he has watched this year as electricity affordability went from a niche issue to a full-blown political one – helping drive Democratic wins in Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia.

“This issue is traveling at warp speed,” Hua said.

And Democrats are continuing to seize on the issue. Democratic Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois is a main co-sponsor of the Cheap Energy Act, which would restore clean energy tax credits, put guardrails around data center development to ensure companies are paying for the electricity they use, and provide energy assistance to millions of households who face electricity and gas shutoffs as their bills mount. Casten said he wanted to put forward a proactive plan for how Democrats would seek to lower bills, to give candidates something to run on.

“Inflation in the last election hurt Biden and the Democrats. Inflation in this election is hurting the Republicans,” Casten said. “It causes elections to swing, but it’s important for us to not just assume we’re going to win because (voters) don’t like what the other side is doing. We need an affirmative view of what to do.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/06-06-gettyimages-2226818708.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-17 08:59:24.075025

Jimmy Pang has spent the past few months trying to map out a long-term plan to keep his health care while growing his physical therapy practice in San Diego.

It’s a conundrum millions of small business owners and self-employed Americans are now facing. Health care through the federal Affordable Care Act is getting more expensive, and the tax credits that helped make it affordable will shrink or disappear in 2026. The change comes after a Republican-led Congress refused to extend the enhanced credits despite pleas from voters and a sustained push from Democrats that shuttered the government.

“I have chronic health issues, and I am very dependent on my health insurance,” said Pang, who suffers from chronic headaches and pain. “I’m seen by multiple specialists. That is the biggest thing for me.”

Pang pays about $350 a month for his plan through the federal health care exchange, and a $350 subsidy pays for the rest. Next year, he estimates he’ll pay $750 a month and may qualify for only a $50 subsidy because he moved his therapy practice from the Bay Area to San Diego to be close to his family. He expects 2027 to be even worse, with no subsidy and monthly costs of around $800 or more.

Covered California estimates that on average, consumers will see a 97% increase in premiums in 2026 without the enhanced tax credits. The state expects to lose $2.5 billion in enhanced premium tax credits, the exchange reported.

The changes will be especially tough for the millions of small business owners and self-employed workers across the U.S. They are three times more likely than others to rely on the health care exchange for their own care, according to the Treasury Department.

If lawmakers do nothing by Dec. 31, the consequences will ripple through communities. Small business owners are the country’s biggest job creators and power local economies. They preserve neighborhood culture, prepare our food, care for our children, create entertainment and build community. Yet, they now face choosing between health care and their livelihoods.

▶ California may try to claw back Medi-Cal care by using its minimum wage rules

The enhanced premium tax credits for middle- to higher-income earners were created in 2021 during the pandemic as part of the American Rescue Plan Act and extended the following year through the Inflation Reduction Act. President Joe Biden signed both laws, which had been unanimously rejected by Republicans in Congress.

The enhanced premium credits were intended to help people who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level — $62,600 for an individual and $128,600 for a family of four. For small business owners and gig-economy workers, the credits were a lifeline.

The effort worked. Enrollment surged. Uninsured rates dropped. Entrepreneurs finally had a foothold in a system that often overlooked them.

Roughly 4.2 million small business owners and self-employed workers received their health coverage through the ACA in 2023 — up from 3.3 million the year before, federal Treasury Department data shows. In 2025, the number of self-employed or small business enrollees is expected to reach 5 million, with nearly half a million in California alone, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive-leaning think tank.

The surge was powered almost entirely by affordability. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 93% of marketplace enrollees rely on premium tax credits.

Now, among overall participants, the Congressional Budget Office predicts 4.2 million people will become uninsured by 2034 once those enhanced credits disappear. But the number could be even higher and happen more quickly — 4.8 million by 2026, the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated in a September report.

Not everyone is losing subsidies, but nearly all enrollees on the exchange face massive price hikes, and those two factors will drive people out of the program, according to experts.

The Urban Institute projects that those who earn the least will see the largest increases. Average net premiums for individuals or families earning below 250% of the federal poverty level — or $39,125 for an individual and $80,375 for a family of four — are projected to quadruple in 2026 compared to what they are this year.

“This is a major hit,” said Matthew Buettgens, senior fellow at the Urban Institute and co-author of the September report. “For someone at a higher income, the premium may seem small. But to someone at the lower end, even paying anything at all could be very difficult.”

▶ Covered California braces for health insurance chaos

For small business owners, the exchange may be their only choice for health care. Most have too few employees to negotiate group plans and don’t earn enough to make private insurance affordable without assistance.

Small businesses owned by people of color are especially vulnerable, research shows. They are less likely to have access to group plans and are more likely to rely on the exchange.

“A lot of people try to run a business, and they are on high-deductible plans because they are healthy, but everyone is one second away from an accident,” Pang said. “I can’t imagine what restaurants, coffee shops and others are going to do. All of their costs are going up as well, and now they have this on top.”

Pang also worries about losing protections for preexisting conditions.

“If that happened, I’d be pretty screwed,” Pang said. “I don’t have a life-threatening condition, but I have serious conditions.”

In California, new preliminary estimates show that 280,000 people are expected to drop off Covered California once the enhanced premium subsidies expire, said Dylan Roby, faculty associate at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and professor at UC Irvine’s School of Population & Public Health. Of those, about 80,000 may find other coverage, and the rest are likely to go uninsured. Roby said the figures are part of “preliminary unpublished estimates” that he is working on with UCLA and UC Berkeley.

While not everyone is losing their credits, the expiration of the enhanced credits for higher earners is rippling through the marketplace and spiking prices even for enrollees who will not lose subsidies. Insurance actuaries priced 2026 coverage higher based on expectations that healthier and younger people will leave the exchange once subsidies disappear.

“If subsidies had been extended,” Roby said, “premiums could have been about 20% lower.”

In Los Angeles, independent television editor David Dennick has talked to three insurance brokers and spent hours comparing plans, poring over documents and estimating his budget for his family of four knowing that they will lose the $850 enhanced subsidy they have relied on for years.

Staying on the same Blue Shield of California plan, through Covered California, would push their premiums from $1,389 to $2,478 a month. Switching to a lesser HealthNet plan will still cost them $1,837, nearly $500 more than today — and that’s before higher deductibles and fees.

Navigating expensive health care isn’t a new experience for Dennick, but it’s frustrating to be in this position again.

Dennick and his wife, a marriage and family therapist, have been buying their own coverage for decades. Before the Affordable Care Act, it was expensive, and one year they were denied coverage due to a false “preexisting condition” notation based on a random abnormal test many years prior.

The passage of Obamacare in 2010 changed that. For a time, it made care accessible and affordable, especially when the enhanced premium tax credits began four years ago.

But without the enhanced premium credit, they will again be paying far more than they can comfortably afford. Dennick says the math is keeping him up at night.

“We can’t afford it and can’t afford not to have it,” Dennick said. “We could potentially lose everything we have worked our whole lives for because of unrealistic health insurance.”

With inflation, an unstable entertainment industry and rising costs everywhere, Dennick says it feels like pressure from all sides.

“It feels crushing. I feel like we are just basically trying to stay afloat,” he said. “With inflation and everything, it’s so much tougher to feel like the future is bright.”

During the 43-day government shutdown that ultimately ended with Democrats giving in without securing protection for health care prices or credits, Dennick was so outraged that he wrote letters to California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla. He implored them to fight to keep the enhanced credits. He got a standard letter in response.

On Thursday, the U.S. Senate blocked an effort by Democrats to extend the expiring subsidies, essentially killing any hope for a last minute save.

In West Hollywood, Alison Gordon, known professionally as the “Insurance Mom,” manages about 2,000 clients. Many of them, she says, are facing the loss of the enhanced premium subsidy and don’t want to switch plans or lose their doctors. There are two paths she’s seeing her clients following. Families and people with chronic conditions are scrambling to keep the same or lesser coverage even if it costs more. And younger, healthier people are weighing whether to drop out entirely.

Gordon said there has been confusion over which subsidies are going away. She is reassuring some clients about the program and helping others consider their options. She encourages consumers to talk to a broker, like Dennick did.

“Covered California is too easy to navigate incorrectly. People need help right now,” she said.

Even for those who remain insured, access remains a challenge. Many Californians with coverage still face long waits for specialists, inadequate provider networks, increased deductibles and unpredictable out-of-pocket costs.

Dennick was billed $2,000 for his son’s 15-minute emergency room visit this year where a doctor examined his son’s throat and gave him antinausea medication. Dennick and his wife spent hours contesting the inflated bill, and it was eventually lowered.

They’re not alone. Many Californians have to make similar calls to decipher and contest expensive bills, and small business owners who power our local economies stress about when and how to go to the doctor.

The solutions are straightforward. Congress could restore or extend the enhanced tax credits. States like California could offer supplemental subsidies, as they’ve done before — though mainly for very low-income families.

But the overarching problem, that health care premiums are becoming out of reach for most Americans, will require more investigation — and action — by state and federal officials to fix.

Dearborn, Mich.—Ford Motor Company has announced a series of actions this week to sharpen its Ford+ plan, executing a redeployment of capital to meet customer demand and drive growth.

The company is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storage business. As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.

This approach prioritizes affordability, choice and profits. Ford will expand powertrain choices — including a range of hybrids and extended-range electric propulsion — while focusing its pure electric vehicle development on its flexible Universal EV Platform for smaller, affordable models.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

The evolved strategy is built on these pillars:

Expanding Customer Choice with Gas, Hybrids and Low-Cost EV Platform

By 2030, Ford expects approximately 50% of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025.

Ford will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform. This next-generation architecture is engineered to underpin a high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles designed to be accessible to millions of customers.

The first vehicle from the Universal EV Platform will be the fully connected midsize pickup truck assembled at Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.

Ford plans to expand hybrids with a range of executions based on customer needs and duty cycle—economical, performance hybrids and hybrids with exportable power. Ford is enhancing its strategy for larger trucks and SUVs to better align with customer demand for capability, towing and range, which includes adding extended-range electric options to its lineup.

As part of this plan, Ford’s next-generation F-150 Lightning will shift to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture and be assembled at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Mich. Production of the current generation F-150 Lightning has concluded as Ford redeploys employees to Dearborn Truck Plant to support a third crew for F-150 gas and hybrid truck production as a result of the Novelis fires.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer. “Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love — 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration — and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive. It will be an incredibly versatile tool delivered in a capital-efficient way.”

The company no longer intends to produce a previously planned new electric commercial van for Europe but will continue to maintain its full lineup of electrified vans for that market. Ford also plans to replace a planned electric commercial van for North America with a new, affordable commercial van –with gas and hybrid models – to meet the needs of commercial customers. This new van will be manufactured at Ford’s Ohio Assembly Plant.

These moves complement the company’s plan to launch five new affordable vehicles by the end of the decade, four of which will be assembled in the U.S. Ford also plans to expand gas, hybrid and extended-range electric options across its portfolio with nearly every vehicle featuring a hybrid or multi-energy powertrain choice by the end of the decade.

Recently, Ford announced a series of changes to its business in Europe, including new leadership to drive the strategic direction, and a European product offensive that will bring a new generation of multi-energy vehicles to customers in Europe. Ford also announced a strategic partnership with Renault to collaborate in the development of electric vehicles in both the commercial and passenger segments.

Expanding Ford’s Truck and Van Leadership with New U.S. Production

This strategy reinforces Ford’s commitment to American manufacturing by repurposing its facilities in Tennessee and Ohio to expand its truck and van lineup leadership.

Tennessee Truck Plant: On the BlueOval City campus, the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center is renamed Tennessee Truck Plant. The facility will produce all-new Built Ford Tough truck models with production starting in 2029. These new affordable gas-powered trucks will broaden Ford’s truck family and extend its market leadership, replacing the previously planned next-generation electric truck.

Ohio Assembly Plant: The plant will become a central hub for Ford Pro, assembling the new gas- and hybrid-powered commercial van starting in 2029, alongside Super Duty chassis cabs, strengthening Ford’s commercial vehicle dominance.

Launching a Battery Energy Storage System Business

Ford is launching a new business — including sales and service — to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid. Ford plans to repurpose existing U.S. battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Ky., to serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market.

This initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford. The company also plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.

The Kentucky site will be converted to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility. These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers.

Ford plans to bring initial capacity online within 18 months, positioning the company to capture share in the growing U.S. battery energy storage systems market. Ford currently plans to deploy at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.

Last week, Ford, SK On, SK Battery America and BlueOval SK entered into a joint venture disposition agreement. Under this mutual agreement, a Ford subsidiary will independently own and operate the Kentucky battery plants. SK On will fully own and operate the Tennessee battery plant.

Separately, Ford will utilize BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, Mich., to produce smaller Amp-hour cells for use in residential energy storage solutions. This plant remains on track to begin manufacturing LFP prismatic battery cells in 2026 to power Ford’s upcoming midsize electric truck, the first model on the new Universal EV Platform.",https://www.aftermarketmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/logo-4-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:00:47.283213

Now, their predictions are coming true. And more Republicans are starting to openly worry that the issue could hurt them in next year’s midterm elections.

Electricity and heating bills around the country are soaring. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4% – with over a dozen states seeing double digit increases year-over-year.

And anger over high bills is showing up on the campaign trail. Emphasizing the rising cost of energy bills, food and health care, Democrats rode an affordability message to a string of victories in November, winning governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia and flipping two seats on Georgia’s public utility commission.

The issue is “not going away,” said Adrian Deveny, founder of consulting firm Climate Vision and a former top Senate Democratic staffer. Republicans “should be very worried because they are going to be held accountable for it.”

The Republican leading the House GOP campaign arm, Rep. Richard Hudson, told CNN that Republicans are working on solutions to drive down energy costs.

“We’re living right now with high cost because of Democratic policies,” Hudson claimed. “They’re doing a very good job of trying to blame us for it.”

Most Republicans argue the party inherited the problem of high utility bill prices as a result of Biden administration policy, but there are still moderates who have been advocating for the embrace of as many energy sources as possible, including clean energy – and raising alarms that their party has not done enough to address the issue of high energy costs.

The party tensions came to a head on Tuesday when a small group of Republicans almost tanked a procedural vote on a bill looking to speed up the federal permitting and regulatory process for energy infrastructure projects.

High energy bills are being driven by a few key factors: the high cost of energy infrastructure, a spike in the cost of natural gas and the significant amount of power AI data centers are suddenly consuming. There’s a massive imbalance in the amount of electricity they need, and the amount of power that exists now to serve it.

“You have to get more power on the grid,” GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York told CNN.

Earlier this year, Republicans voted to do the opposite. At the behest of President Donald Trump, the GOP gutted generous Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy. That move, experts and some moderate Republicans fear, is taking the cheapest and fastest-to-build forms of energy off the table – in turn, making America’s growing electricity crisis worse.

“One of the arguments being made when we were talking about going after the credits in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is this is going to affect utility payments,” said Garbarino, who had initially pushed to not kill the tax credits before ultimately supporting the bill.

GOP Rep. Gabe Evans was another Republican who pushed his colleagues to extend the clean energy tax credits. The Colorado Republican was in House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office arguing for it a day before the final vote.

“Myself and a few other Republicans understand that business needs to have a runway to be able to make good decisions,” Evans, who voted for the final bill, told CNN. “My district truly is an all-of-the-above energy district, and so I fight for policies that promote all of the above.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said utility bill rate hikes have mostly plagued Democratic states; even though federal data show consumers in several GOP-led states including Georgia, Ohio and Indiana have also seen stark increases in their bills.

“Fixing Joe Biden’s energy crisis has been a priority for President Trump since day one, and lowering energy costs for American families and businesses will continue to be a top priority in the new year,” Rogers said in a statement.

Some Republicans have seen the impacts firsthand of how their party’s policies and rhetoric around this issue have backfired.

GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew, whose coastal New Jersey district has seen some of the largest utility bill price hikes in the nation, has been raising alarm bells within his own party since the Republican in the New Jersey governor’s race, Jack Ciattarelli, lost to Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in a campaign where Sherrill campaigned heavily on the issue of energy affordability.

New Jersey saw the second biggest jump in electricity rates in the nation last year, behind only the District of Columbia. And as Sherrill vowed to bring down electricity prices, Van Drew’s team repeatedly warned Ciattarelli’s camp to redirect their focus back to why people’s utility bills were going up instead of focusing on Sherrill’s service in the Navy or stock trading practices while serving as a member of Congress.

Van Drew says his advice went unanswered. Ciattarelli lost the race by 14 points.

“It’s way too expensive to live here. I got to give it to [the Democrats], they stole the issue from the Republicans. The Republicans should have won on this issue. They didn’t do their job. It was a bad campaign on their part,” Van Drew told CNN.

Through conversations with President Donald Trump and House GOP leadership, Van Drew has been pushing his party to crystalize its message that Republicans inherited the energy affordability issue but are going to fix it.

But the New Jersey Republican admitted that messaging strategy comes with hurdles.

“Whenever you have to explain, it’s a problem,” Van Drew said.

‘Prices are just going to keep going up’

At the direction of Trump, the party has pivoted away from clean energy sources like solar and wind. In addition to the hit renewables took in Congress this year, the Trump administration has thrown up multiple roadblocks to make wind and solar projects more difficult to build.

The permitting reform legislation expected to get a final vote this week – titled the SPEED Act – would amend a landmark environmental law to make it easier to build oil and gas pipelines and large inter-state power lines carrying electricity from one part of the country to another.

“If we don’t start building more, the prices are just going to keep going up,” GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources panel and is sponsoring the legislation, told CNN.

One of the sticking points on Tuesday was that a small group of Republicans did not want offshore wind projects to be given a fast-track permitting process without the ability for the Trump administration to intervene.

But even with cutting regulatory red tape through legislation, those infrastructure projects will still take years and cannot provide immediate relief to people who are suddenly seeing their utility bills doubling. And Westerman’s bill doesn’t address the need for more power generation – the renewables, gas or nuclear plants that actually generate electricity.

In the short term, even more sticker shock is on the way for everyday Americans.

“Republicans are worried right now, but if they think this is bad, just wait until next year,” Deveny said. “We have a line of sight to further increases in electricity prices. You can see it in utility rate filings; it’s coming.”

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday's separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden's ""EV mandate."" While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent -- to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

The UK-based NGO has tracked more than €82bn of investment in European battery gigafactories to date. Three-quarters of this investment has been pledged to projects within the EU.

If all the projects come to fruition, the continent will host 1.2 TWh of gigafactory capacity. This is enough to meet the continent’s demand.

Nonetheless, New AutoMotive has found that Europe has perhaps focused on final battery manufacturing at the expense of building a strong investment pipeline in refining, precursor production and anode materials.

Without further action, it is likely to “lock in” dependence on imported materials.

The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act, which entered into force in May 2024, sets several targets to enhance the bloc’s self-sufficiency. These include extracting enough domestically to meet 10% of demand, achieving a 25% recycling rate and ensuring

All targets have a 2030 deadline. The Act also sets out plans to diversify where imported materials are sourced from.

Regulatory certainty needed

The new research has been published as EU lawmakers confirmed changes to the bloc’s emissions standards for cars and vans, which, in their original form, essentially banned internal combustion engine (ICE) models from 2035.

Policymakers were reportedly minded to allow the sale of hybrids, and potentially ICE vans, until 2040.

Instead, the rules have been changed to compel automakers to ensure that 90% of the cars and vans they put on the market by 2035 are zero-emission, down from 100%.

New AutoMotive is among the organisations warning against this move. It states that emissions standards “function as the investment contract between Europe and its battery industry, providing the long-term demand signal that mining, refining, gigafactories and recycling projects rely on”.",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/ElectricVehicleCharger.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:00:52.124419

“Electric vehicles are still the future, but the transition to EVs was always going to take longer than automakers have been promising the public.”","DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. is pivoting away from its once-ambitious electric vehicle plans amid financial losses and waning consumer demand for the vehicles in lieu of investment in more efficient gasoline-engines and hybrid EVs, the company said Monday.

The Detroit automaker, which has poured billions of dollars into electrification along with most of its industry peers, said it will no longer make the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, instead opting for an extended range version of the vehicle.

Ford will also introduce some manufacturing changes; its Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center — part of the BlueOval City campus and once the future of Ford’s EVs and batteries — is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant and will produce new affordable gas-powered trucks instead. Ford’s Ohio Assembly Plant will produce a new gas and hybrid van.

The company has lost $13 billion on EVs since 2023 and said it expects to take a $19.5 billion hit largely in the fourth quarter due to the EV business.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

Ford said it now expects half of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs — which also incorporate a gasoline-powered engine — and full EVs by 2030, up from 17% this year.

“Ford’s elimination of the electric F-150 Lightning is not much of a surprise after the truck failed to come close to filling the plant’s capacity. Ford’s choice to convert an existing gas-powered truck to accept the electric drivetrain helped reduce their upfront costs which, in hindsight, was the right move,” Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.

“For months, the future of Blue Oval City has been in question and this announcement locks in the direction of this large plant,” Fiorani added. “Adding an affordable vehicle to the Ford lineup fills a glaring gap in the market.”

Several other automakers have made changes to their electrified product plans in recent years as consumer demand for EVs in the U.S. hasn’t quite met expectations.

EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicles sales in the U.S. last year, but factors such as cost and charging infrastructure remain concerns for mainstream buyers.

The average transaction price for a new EV last month was $58,638, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Meanwhile, while public charging availability has improved, the industry has relied on home charging as a selling point for prospective buyers, and not everyone has access to charging at-home.

Since taking office for a second time, President Donald Trump has drastically shifted U.S. policy away from EVs, calling EV-friendly policy set under former President Joe Biden a “mandate.”

Though Biden-era policies — including generous tax incentives for consumers, and tailpipe and fuel economy rules for automakers — encouraged EV adoption, no policies required the industry to sell or Americans to buy EVs. Biden targeted half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Trump administration has since slashed that target, eliminated EV tax credits and proposed weakening the emissions and gas mileage rules.

“The one-two punch of the public’s slow EV adoption and the Trump administration’s softer stance on fuel economy and emissions has encouraged every automaker to re-think their current direction,” Fiorani added. “Electric vehicles are still the future, but the transition to EVs was always going to take longer than automakers have been promising the public.”",https://wowo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2545290.png,N,,2025-12-17 02:58:28.888399

The Port of Bellingham announced on Friday that it plans to install eight electric vehicle charging stations at the Granary parking lot.

The Port is partnering with Rivian Adventure Network and PSE to add the EV chargers. Rivian will also be regrading and upgrading that section of the parking lot to make it more accessible and usable.

The lot’s north entrance will be temporarily closed during construction, while the south entrance and exit remain open.

The charging stations are expected to be ready by February 2026.

CARY, N.C. (AP) — Harrison Bertos scored 1:54 into overtime after Washington blew a two-goal lead in the second half, and the Huskies beat North Carolina State 3-2 to win the Men’s College Cup at First Horizon Stadium on Monday night.

It was the first national championship for unseeded Washington (16-6-2), who became the first team to win six road matches in the tournament — beating six seeded teams along the way under the guidance of coach Jamie Clark. The Huskies won in their second trip to the final after losing 2-0 to Clemson in 2021.

No. 15 seed N.C. State (16-3-4) made the final for the first time behind coach Marc Hubbard. The Wolfpack were aiming for the school’s first national championship since Jim Valvano led the men’s basketball team to the title in 1983.

Zach Ramsey scored unassisted with 1:12 remaining in the first half and Washington took a 1-0 lead into the break. It was only the second time this season that N.C. State trailed at halftime.

Ramsey scored into an empty net after Wolfpack goalkeeper Logan Erb couldn’t corral the ball at the top of the box. It was Ramsey’s second goal of the tournament.

Richie Aman sent a cross to the center of the goal and Joe Dale knocked it in for a 2-0 lead in the 62nd minute.

Donavan Phillip answered in the 66th, scoring with an assist from Nikola Markovic to cut it to 2-1 with his fourth goal of the tournament. The Wolfpack entered 11-0-1 when Phillip scores.

Taig Healy scored the equalizer with 3:28 remaining with assists from Justin Mclean and Calem Tommy.

Egor Akulov had an assist on Bertos’ winner.

Huskies keeper Jadon Bowton, the only remaining player from the 2021 squad, had five saves.

Battery storage business Ford also announced a new battery energy storage system business alongside its announced shift away from EVs ""to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid.""","The removal of key federal and state policies that have propped up the US electric vehicle market is setting up 2026 to be a tough year, an S&P Global Energy analyst said Dec. 16, with the challenging market environment exemplified by the $20 billion strategy shift just announced by Ford Motor Co.

The end of federal tax credits in September plays a role, said Fellipe Balieiro, director of global mobility research at S&P Global Energy, but the real long-term demand softener is the end of EV adoption targets in key states like California.

""If [Ford] is not going to be out of compliance for selling electric trucks, then why should they prioritize selling electric trucks?"" Balieiro said. ""If you're an automaker and you don't have to sell hybrids today, or in 26 or in 27 or potentially even 28, do you make the investment, or do you wait and see what happens?""

Generally speaking, purely electric vehicles are Ford's lowest-profit margin vehicles, he said. The company's EV segment was at a nearly $4 billion loss back in Q3.

""Anytime you reinvent yourself, if you're a legacy automaker, you're gonna lose money, because you've invested billions of dollars in research and machining and tooling, and until that equipment is fully amortized, you're going to lose money,"" Balieiro said. ""You can't pass all of the costs on to consumers all at once or the vehicles become unaffordable.""

Ford's restructuring

Ford announced its strategic shift away from electric vehicles and towards hybrid and internal combustion engine vehicles on Dec. 15.

""The company is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storage business,"" Ford said in a statement. ""As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.""

Ford will cancel planned electric vans and will focus instead on hybrid/gasoline options, it said. The company also announced that the next generation of its F-150 Lightning electric truck will be a hybrid.

Ford will focus on ""smaller, affordable"" models for its pure electric production, the company said.

Ford will record an about $19.5 billion charge from its strategy shift, mostly in the current quarter, with the remainder in 2026 and 2027. The company said these moves will put the EV segment on a ""path to profitability"" by 2029.

Ford's EV sales fell sharply after the federal $7,500 tax credit ended in September, but its hybrid sales continued to grow on the year, company data shows. Purely electric vehicle sales fell 60% on the year in November.

Ford is also facing supply chain disruptions due to recent fires at a key auto aluminum plant in Oswego, New York. The plant supplies 40% of the US auto sector's aluminum sheet. Ford previously said the September fire alone would cost $2 billion.

""The operating reality has changed,"" CEO Jim Farley said.

Battery storage business

Ford also announced a new battery energy storage system business alongside its announced shift away from EVs ""to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid.""

Ford will repurpose its battery manufacturing facility to serve this new business, leveraging ""underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity,"" with a target of 20 GWh deployed annually by late 2027, it said.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-17 12:00:59.804119

The funding was approved by Congress on a bipartisan basis to help states modernize transportation corridors, reduce pollution, and support growing demand for electric vehicles — including medium- and heavy-duty trucks that move goods across the state.

“Oregon’s freight corridors keep our economy moving — from farm goods and timber to everyday products families rely on,” said Attorney General Rayfield. “When these projects are delayed, it doesn’t just affect charging stations. It affects jobs, supply chains, and the cost of doing business in our state. Congress already approved this funding, and Oregon should not be penalized because this administration decided to put the brakes on investments that support our economy and working communities.”

The funding was approved by Congress to help states modernize transportation corridors, reduce pollution, and support growing demand for electric vehicles — including medium- and heavy-duty trucks that move goods across the state. Despite that approval, the U.S. Department of Transportation has stopped allowing states to access these funds, leaving projects in limbo and slowing economic progress.

Congress created these programs as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help states build and maintain EV charging infrastructure over five years. Oregon and the other states were counting on this funding to keep pace with growing demand for cleaner, more affordable transportation options — particularly along busy highways where trucks and freight traffic are concentrated.

In 2024, Oregon partnered with California and Washington on a $102 million project to build electric and hydrogen charging stations for medium- and heavy-duty trucks along Interstate 5 and other key freight corridors. These routes are critical to Oregon’s economy, supporting trade up and down the West Coast and beyond. The project was expected to create jobs, attract private investment, and lower long-term transportation costs for businesses.

Oregon’s Department of Transportation has been actively working to move the project forward, but the federal government’s refusal to release funds has slowed progress and created uncertainty for contractors, workers, and local communities. The lawsuit asks the court to block the Trump Administration from continuing to withhold the funds and to allow states to move forward with projects Congress already authorized.

DETROIT, Dec 16 (Reuters) – Ford CEO Jim Farley walked through Ford’s Michigan design studio Monday afternoon, reflecting on how he was about to wipe out thousands of work hours on electric vehicles that he and his team had hoped would revolutionize the American auto industry.

Shortly after, his company announced it would kill several of those battery-powered models and take a $19.5 billion writedown on EV-related assets. It marked the industry’s biggest electric-vehicle retreat since U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping auto-policy changes iced already cooling EV demand.

Farley had spent years telling ‍staff and investors that catching up to Tesla and China’s leading EV makers amounted to an existential struggle. Now – after losing about $13 billion on EVs since 2023 – Farley says the path to survival lies in ditching these unprofitable models.

“We can’t allocate money for things that will not make money,” he told Reuters on Monday. “As much as I love those products, the customers in the U.S. were not going to pay for them. And that was the end of that.”

Farley’s angst reflects the broader conundrum facing auto executives in the wake of Trump-administration policies that stripped the industry of EV subsidies and eased restrictions on tailpipe pollution.

Most automakers now can’t sell EVs in the U.S. profitably or in volume – but must sell them in China, Europe and other markets to appease regulators and compete with Chinese automakers expanding globally.

That’s left Ford and other automakers with the challenge of tailoring vastly different vehicle lineups for different regions.

The approach layers on extra expenses ‌the industry thought it had left behind in recent decades through globalization – making essentially the same car, with common supply chains, to sell worldwide. Fifteen years ‌ago, then-CEO Alan Mulally called the strategy ‘One Ford.’

Now Farley needs many Fords. His company and others have been turning to partnerships to absorb the extra costs of catering to different global markets. Renault and Ford earlier this month announced they would partner to build affordable EVs for Europe.

Following the partnership announcement, Ford said Monday it won’t build the electric commercial van it initially planned for that market. Ford has also been seeking a Chinese partner to provide EV platform technologies, Reuters has reported.

On EVs, Farley hopes to thread the needle by killing most EV models but preserving a $30,000 midsize electric truck due out in 2027, which a specialized skunkworks team in ​California has engineered to take on EV powerhouses Tesla and China’s BYD.

“As a global company competing against the Chinese and others, we do not have time,” Farley said.

Michael Dunne, a consultant and former General Motors executive who spent years in China, said U.S. automakers have little choice but to balance raking in U.S. profits from gas-powered trucks while competing overseas with Chinese and other EV makers.

“EVs are not going to go away,” ‍Dunne said. “So are we going to compete globally or are we just going to stay at home?”

GOVERNMENT SUPPORT DRIVES ELECTRIC CARS

U.S. ​electric-vehicle sales have dropped sharply since the Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500-per-car consumer tax credit, killed in Trump-supported legislation.

That and other administration policies have cemented America’s status ​as an EV laggard relative to the world’s two other largest car markets. In China, EVs and plug-in hybrids account for roughly half of sales; in Europe, they comprise around 25%. U.S. sales sank to around 5% after ‍Trump policies took effect.

Ford’s writedown reflects “a broader industry reckoning” that EV economics still don’t work without government support, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive’s director of industry insights.

Other automakers are grappling with those brutal economics.

GM in October recorded a $1.6 billion charge as it scaled back EV plans and warned more charges would follow. It is also retooling EV factories into gasoline-vehicle production hubs. Citigroup analysts said they expect GM’s charges ultimately to be less than Ford’s. GM has passed Ford in EV sales, although analysts estimate the company continues to lose billions on them.

GM had dismissed gas-electric hybrids as a waste of capital while it leaned into a lineup of about a dozen EVs for U.S. customers, which had started to gain sales traction just before Trump policies took hold. Now some of GM’s biggest U.S. competitors, Ford and Toyota, are ‍leaning heavily into hybrids and seeing sales grow rapidly as consumers turn away from fully electric vehicles.

As Ford dropped most EV models, it nonetheless vowed that half its global sales volume by 2030 would consist of EVs, hybrids or so-called “extended-range” electric models, in which a small gasoline engine is used to recharge the large battery. Those models total 17% today. If current consumer trends hold, the vast majority of those vehicles will ‍be hybrids with no charging plug, which vastly outsell plug-ins.

Hybrids already account for ‍nearly half of all U.S. sales for Toyota, which in recent years took heavy criticism for sticking with hybrids over EVs. Elliot Johnson, chief investment officer ​at Evolve ETFs, which holds Ford shares, cheered the Detroit automaker’s move to follow Toyota’s lead.

“Hybrids are the future for legacy automakers,” Johnson said, offering ​automakers an easier ⁠path to transition existing customers to electrified models without charging hassles.

Stellantis is battling to regain U.S. market share by focusing on hybrids and prioritizing sales ‌of fleet vehicles. Volkswagen carved out its standalone EV company Scout to tackle the electric market while leaning on partners Rivian and Chinese EV maker Xpeng to develop software.

Representatives for Stellantis and Volkswagen declined to comment. A GM spokesman pointed to its previously disclosed plans to offer plug-in hybrids. A White House spokesperson didn’t respond to requests for comment.

When asked what factors contributed most to the massive move, from waning consumer interest in EVs to Trump’s policy shifts, Farley said it was difficult to give specific weight to any of them. “It’s not one thing. It’s actually a combination of all of them.”

While the EV market has been tough for a while, Farley said pressure has increased recently to take action.

“Over the last several months,” he said, “it became really clear to the team. We’ve got to make a change.”

Undertaken through three LS C&S subsidiaries, the company estimates the project will create over 430 new jobs.

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) stated that the complex will feature copper rod production, magnet wire manufacturing for automotive and industrial markets and rare earth magnet production for electric motors and advanced weapons systems. The company already supplies rectangular magnet wire to General Motors and Hyundai.

The development builds on the previously announced first phase of LS GreenLink USA’s submarine cable manufacturing and pier facility project, which broke ground in April 2025.

Follow that frigid air north to the Arctic, and you find a region undergoing sweeping changes that could have global consequences. (I also wrote about the worrying state of the Arctic last year.)

Temperatures in the Arctic are warming far faster than the rest of the planet. Sea ice is rapidly declining, opening up new shipping routes. And record temperatures and thawing permafrost are turning Arctic rivers orange with toxic heavy metals, according to a new report from federal scientists.

But this year, there are also near-term policy upheavals that are reshaping the Arctic.

The Trump administration is working to commercialize Alaska, opening up previously protected waters to oil and gas drilling, and allowing preparations for a road that would reach a proposed copper and zinc mine. The White House is also prioritizing national security in the region, expanding military operations and vying for influence in Greenland.

Against this backdrop, Trump has his eyes fixed on the area. In an executive order signed in April, he instructed the government to take steps to “ensure the security and leadership of Arctic waterways.”

The Arctic as a strategic asset

Shortly after retaking office this year, Trump began moving to exert American influence over Greenland, which is a Danish territory that is mostly covered by a vast ice sheet. Since then, the White House has used a mix of flattery and threats to try and make its case. The U.S. is adding new icebreakers to its fleet, and Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March.

This has all led to fraying alliances, with Denmark’s military intelligence service recently raising concerns about the United States.

On Monday, the White House appointed Tom Dans to lead the United States Arctic Research Commission. Dans has been a key figure in Trump’s efforts to exert influence in Greenland and is the brother of Paul Dans, an architect of Project 2025, a right-wing blueprint for overhauling the government.

Last month the Trump administration “announced a plan to allow new oil and gas drilling across nearly 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, including a remote region off Alaska in the northern Arctic where drilling has never before taken place,” Maxine Joselow and Lisa Friedman report.

A month before that, Trump signed an executive order ""directing the government to approve a 211-mile industrial road that would cut through pristine Alaskan wilderness to reach a proposed copper and zinc mine,” they wrote.

Yet even as the White House looks for new commercial opportunities in the Arctic, it is facing obstacles.

In January, an auction for the rights to drill in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge did not attract a single bid. Major American banks have said they would not finance drilling in the protected area. The new areas Trump has opened for exploration include the coastal waters of the refuge, but it is not yet clear if any new drilling will occur.

Even if projects begin moving forward, they are likely to be met with lawsuits. This month, environmentalists sued to stop ConocoPhillips from drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve, a vast expanse on Alaska’s North Slope.

Nevertheless, ConocoPhillips is among the companies that are pressing ahead in the region. In 2023, it began construction of the $8 billion Willow project in Alaska.

Explaining the company’s thinking at the time, Connor Dunn, a ConocoPhillips manager, said: “There is going to be a significant need for U.S. domestic oil production for a great many decades to come.”

Dire warnings about the Arctic’s future

As the commercial and geostrategic terrain shifts, so, too, has the Arctic landscape.

As Eric Niiler reports, record-setting temperatures and rainfall in the Arctic over the past year have sped up the thawing of permafrost and washed toxic minerals, including naturally occurring deposits of pyrite, into some Alaskan rivers.

That’s according to a report issued on Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which documented rapid environmental changes from Norway’s Svalbard Island to the Greenland ice sheet and the tundra of northern Canada and Alaska.

Arctic tundra, which for thousands of years has absorbed carbon dioxide, is now releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.

All that heat, and the arrival of more rain instead of snow, is causing glaciers to melt, both on land and at sea. One result, scientists fear, is that an influx of fresh water into the North Atlantic could disrupt the ocean currents and have ripple effects across the world.

Raymond Zhong recently accompanied a group of researchers on an expedition to the waters off Greenland as they studied this scenario.

But while the Trump administration is fixated on commercial opportunities, it is turning a blind eye to science in the region.

As Sachi Mulkey wrote, in May, a government committee took the unusual step of ​editing a Biden-era planning document on the Arctic to “align with the current administration’s policies.” The revised version no longer included the words climate change, a main focus of work there for decades.

Clean, limitless energy exists. China is going big in the race to harness it.

Fusion energy, the melding together of atoms to release extraordinary energy, uses fuels that are plentiful, carries no risk of meltdowns and leaves no long-lived radioactive waste.

China and the United States are in a tightening contest to dominate the energy future, and fusion energy could change the calculus for both nations and the globe. Whoever conquers it could build plants around the world and forge new alliances with energy-hungry countries.

But the Americans and the Chinese have very different strategies for getting there.

Over the summer, the Chinese government and private investors poured $2.1 billion into a new state-owned fusion company. That investment alone is two and a half times the U.S. Energy Department’s annual fusion budget. — Raymond Zhong, Chris Buckley, Keith Bradsher and Harry Stevens

The fire, which burned through over 1 million acres of the Texas panhandle and western Oklahoma in early 2024, is the largest recorded wildfire in Texas history. It started on February 26, 2024, when a decayed utility pole owned by Xcel snapped during high winds, causing the pole’s power lines to ignite dry grass. The fire burned for nearly three weeks before being declared fully contained on March 16.

In a complaint filed in Hemphill County District Court, Paxton claims Xcel had been notified weeks before the fire started that the pole needed to be replaced.

“But instead of replacing its deteriorated equipment, Xcel ignored the warning and chose to place marginal profits — amounting to only a few thousand dollars — above the safety and wellbeing of Texans, the state’s property and the natural resources enjoyed by all people,” Paxton writes in the complaint.

A day after the fire started, a second Xcel utility pole fell, starting the 687 Reamer Fire, which later joined with the Smokehouse Creek Fire.

Paxton is suing Xcel for negligence, gross negligence, trespass, public nuisance, unjust enrichment and violations of Texas’ Public Utility Regulatory Act and agency rules. He also claims the company violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by falsely marketing its utility services as safe and reliable.

In a press release announcing the lawsuit, Paxton’s office said Xcel failed to replace aging utility poles, including some that were almost 100 years old — double their typical forty-year lifespan.

“Xcel’s blatant negligence killed three Texans and caused unfathomable destruction in the Texas Panhandle,” Paxton said in the statement. “The company made false representations about its safety commitments and ignored warnings that its aging infrastructure needed immediate repair and to be updated. This created a substantial wildfire risk, which Xcel did nothing about. There must be accountability for the death and devastation the company caused. Xcel owes a duty of care to the residents and customers in its service area. Xcel failed this duty, and I am here to hold them accountable.”

In a statement to Courthouse News Service, Xcel said it is “deeply disappointed” that Paxton chose to bring the suit.

“Though Xcel Energy disputes claims that it acted negligently in maintaining and operating its infrastructure, we accepted responsibility from the beginning and set up an expedited claims process,” the company said. “Even now, the work to fairly compensate those affected continues. To date, Xcel Energy has agreements for settlements totaling $361 million for 212 of 254 total claims made against the company. When the attorney general’s office approached us earlier this year requesting information, we worked with them in good faith to try and find a consensus solution. They chose to file litigation instead. We will review this litigation and vigorously defend ourselves against these allegations.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2024/02/texas-wildfire-feb-2024.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-12-17 02:58:23.801666

My bill, the Power Plant Reliability Act, will help shield Americans from blackout threats and ensure the reliable delivery of power to American homes, factories and communities.
Congressman Griffith’s Power Plant Reliability Act will ensure that reliable coal power remains available to keep the lights on and homes warm by preventing the premature retirement of much needed coal plants.","The U.S. House of Representatives passed Rep. Griffith’s H.R. 3632, the Power Plant Reliability Act of 2025.

This legislation amends Section 207 of the Federal Power Act to allow a Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) or state Public Utility Commission to petition the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue an order to keep a power plant open and to allocate any potential operational or transmission costs needed to fix a grid reliability issue. Under the bill, electric power plants that plan to retire are required to issue a public closure notice five years in advance.

House Republican leaders praised passage of Congressman Griffith’s measure.

“Closures of baseload power plants due to burdensome ‘Green New Scam’ regulations are making America’s energy supply and the millions of Americans who rely on it vulnerable. Thankfully, House Republicans passed legislation this week to allow states and regional operators to contest proposed closures on power plants if the closure could impact electric reliability. I’m grateful to Rep. Griffith for introducing the Power Plant Reliability Act and for all his work to ensure we’re able to keep the lights on for American families at an affordable rate.”— House Majority Leader Steve Scalise

“As artificial intelligence becomes more prominent, the need for a reliable American energy supply has never been higher. Meanwhile, Democrats took us backwards with Green New Scam policies that stifled American energy under the Biden administration. My friend, Representative Griffith, addresses both of these concerns with his commonsense Power Plant Reliability Act. I’m grateful for his leadership on this important issue and look forward to working alongside our entire House Republican team to make America’s energy supply strong, secure, and affordable again.” — House Majority Whip Tom Emmer

“House Republicans are doing what the Democrats’ regulatory agenda won’t do: Delivering reliable, affordable American energy. This bill keeps critical power plants online and lowers costs for families who got crushed by President Biden’s anti-energy agenda.” — House Republican Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain

“To support reliable and affordable electricity for hard-working American families, we cannot afford to take baseload power offline. The Power Plant Reliability Act enhances the tools available to states and grid operators to keep vital power plants operational and prevent blackouts. The ongoing reliability crisis facing our nation has been caused by Democrat policies designed to drive out baseload power in favor of wind and solar that cannot meet our needs. Thank you to Chairman Griffith for leading this critical legislation to strengthen our grid and lower electricity prices.” — House Committee on Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie

“Because of radical ‘Green New Deal’ policies that shun reliable forms of energy like natural gas, coal and nuclear, our electric grid faces a brewing crisis of premature baseload power plant retirements. My bill, the Power Plant Reliability Act, will help shield Americans from blackout threats and ensure the reliable delivery of power to American homes, factories and communities. Thanks to strong leaders like Speaker Johnson, Leader Scalise, Whip Emmer, Chairwoman McClain, Chairman Guthrie and Chairwoman Foxx, the United States Congress is focused on supporting affordable and reliable energy solutions for the American people.” — Representative Morgan Griffith

Industry leaders also expressed support for Congressman Griffith’s bill.

“Time and again when winter cold hits, it’s coal that comes to the reliability rescue. Congressman Griffith’s Power Plant Reliability Act will ensure that reliable coal power remains available to keep the lights on and homes warm by preventing the premature retirement of much needed coal plants. We simply can’t afford to close plants that provide affordable and dependable power to Americans.” – Rich Nolan, President and CEO, National Mining Association

BACKGROUND

In June, the Energy and Commerce Committee favorably reported Congressman Griffith’s measure. During that markup hearing, Congressman Griffith spoke in support of his bill.

Congressman Griffith has long held concerns about the early retirement of Virginia’s and regional electric power plants, including the impacts on electric bills in Southwest Virginia.

In June, Congressman Griffith penned a Washington Examiner op-ed that discussed bolstering America’s electric grid.

The PSC took testimony in an evidentiary hearing Tuesday.

Appalachian Power said it wants to continue to build its renewable energy portfolio because its larger customers are seeking more renewable options.

Nucor Steel West Virginia, which is building a very large plant in Mason County, has signed a contract with Appalachian Power for the utility to provide 20 percent of its power from renewable sources. Appalachian Power Director of Regulatory Services Randall Short told the PSC Tuesday the utility has enough renewable energy to make that happen but it needs additional options for future customers.

“They tell us they have a need for it, either because whatever they’re making has a requirement or they have an obligation, we attempt to meet those needs,” Short testified. “We think its in the interest of the state of West Virginia to keep those jobs here and give them what they need.”

Both PSC Chairman Charlotte Lane and Commissioner Bill Raney asked why Appalachian Power decided against purchasing renewable projects based in West Virginia. American Electric Power Grid Solutions Director Seth Miller testified the projects fell short of what the company was looking for.

“They either fell out from the risk being too high to our customers or the price was too high or permitting risks or interconnection risks were just to a threshold that we would not have an apetite for,” Miller said.

Short said the West Virginia-based projects have not “passed the due diligence to be in the best interest of our customers.”

Lane shot back.

“How could it be in the best interest of our customers if it’s in Illinois or Virginia but not in West Virginia?”

Short said it already happens with coal-generated electricity.

The programs are the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program.
“The USDOT appears to have implemented a de facto freeze of charging and fueling infrastructure funds, in violation of Congress’s directive to fund this program,” Weiser said.
The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration have declined to obligate new funds under both programs since spring 2025.
The states are asking the court to declare the funding freeze unlawful and permanently bar the administration from withholding funds.","DENVER — Colorado on Tuesday joined a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia in suing the Trump administration, alleging it illegally suspended federal funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure approved by Congress.

Attorney General Phil Weiser co-led the lawsuit, which challenges the U.S. Department of Transportation’s refusal to approve new funding under two bipartisan grant programs created by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The programs are the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program.

According to the complaint, the transportation department has not provided notice or explanation for halting approvals and has effectively frozen the programs despite a congressional mandate to distribute the funds.

“The USDOT appears to have implemented a de facto freeze of charging and fueling infrastructure funds, in violation of Congress’s directive to fund this program,” Weiser said. “This is not necessarily a new tactic, and the courts have stopped similar efforts by this administration to freeze funds while conducting vague policy reviews. Demand for electric vehicles continues to grow rapidly in Colorado and I’m committed to fighting for EV owners and clean air.”

Like the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, the CFI and Accelerator programs are five-year initiatives designed to build or repair EV chargers nationwide. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration have declined to obligate new funds under both programs since spring 2025.

Colorado officials say the funding freeze puts multiple projects at risk. In January 2024, the Federal Highway Administration awarded Colorado State University nearly $9 million through the CFI program to develop three public hydrogen fueling stations along Interstate 25 near CSU campuses in Fort Collins, Denver and Pueblo. The project is intended to improve access for medium- and heavy-duty hydrogen-powered fleets and light-duty electric vehicles.

To date, CSU has received about $1.1 million, which has been used for design and permitting. The university has been unable to secure construction funds, and inquiries about additional funding obligations have gone unanswered, according to the complaint. The City of Pueblo and Boulder County also face uncertainty over millions of dollars earmarked for charging and fueling infrastructure.

The lawsuit argues that the administration’s refusal to release the funds violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act. The programs were established by statute, and federal agencies are required to carry out the law as written, the complaint states.

The states are asking the court to declare the funding freeze unlawful and permanently bar the administration from withholding funds.

The lawsuit is being led by the attorneys general of California, Colorado and Washington. They are joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin, as well as the governor of Pennsylvania.",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/10/Photo-courtesy-of-Colorado-Department-of-Transportation.png,N,,2025-12-16 20:57:54.230214

The company will expand its hybrid and gasoline powertrain options, expecting them to make up half of global sales by 2030.

Ford plans to hire thousands of new U.S. employees for roles in vehicle assembly and battery energy storage systems.

Ford Motor Co. has announced a pivot in its future electric vehicle strategy, a move that will cost it $19.5 billion to restructure its business plan, but the automaker will keep the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup in production.

Ford said the pickup will transition into a new model that will use Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) technology, meaning it has a generator on it to recharge it, giving it an estimated range of more than 700 miles and added charging capacity.

Ford made the announcement on Monday, Dec. 15, along with several other announcements including that it will offer a range of hybrid and gasoline powertrains on its vehicles to complement its upcoming new Universal EV Platform, which Ford unveiled in August. By 2030, the company said, it expects that half of all vehicles Ford sells globally will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and electric vehicles compared with 17% today.

The Dearborn automaker also said it will hire ""thousands of new employees"" in the United States over the next few years as it shifts production in various plants and starts a new business building battery energy storage systems at its facilities in Kentucky and Marshall, Michigan.

These moves are part of Ford’s plan to launch five new affordable vehicles by the end of the decade, four of which will be assembled in the United States. Ford said it also plans to expand gasoline, hybrid and extended-range electric options across its portfolio with nearly every vehicle offering a powertrain choice by the end of the decade.

The automaker also said it plans on assembling all-new pickups at BlueOval City in Tennessee and a new gasoline powered and hybrid van will be produced at its Ohio Assembly Plant in Sheffield, Ohio.

Ford said all these actions will help its profit margins, and at its Model e division, which is Ford's electric vehicle unit, it expects it will start seeing improvements to revenue next year and reach profitability in 2029. In the last few years, Ford has bled billions from its Model e division; last year alone Ford lost $5 billion on EVs.

As a result of all these changes, the company said it will record $19.5 billion in charges, with most of it taken in the fourth quarter. Of that $19.5 billion, about $5.5 billion are cash charges with the majority of that being paid in 2026 and the remainder in 2027.

But Ford said due to continued underlying business strength and cost improvements, it is increasing its projected adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for 2025 to $7 billion, up from the previous estimate of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” Jim Farley, Ford CEO, said in a statement. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.""

Adding and subtracting jobs

These changes are Farley's latest tweak to his “Ford+” restructuring plan, which has been changed a few times since he initially outlined it in 2021 as a plan to grow EV sales.

But U.S. sales of EVs have slumped after President Donald Trump's administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credit available to EV buyers, at the end of September. On CNBC on Dec. 15, Farley said that policy change “wasn’t the only reason"" Ford was making these moves, but he acknowledged it was a factor.

“We evaluated the market, and we made the call,” Farley said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime” on Dec. 15. “We’re following customers to where the market is, not where people thought it was going to be, but where it is today.”

Ford now plans to hire across its factories in Michigan, Tennessee and Ohio as it expands its truck and van lineup, Andrew Frick, president of Ford Blue and Ford Model e strategy, told reporters.

At Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, Ford will update the media on how many new jobs will go there after it restarts production on the new version of the Lightning, Frick said. Ford will share more details about the vehicle and its production and launch timing at a later date.

In October, Ford transferred about 500 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center to its Dearborn Truck plant to help with increased production of the F-150 pickup. Ford makes its gasoline- and hybrid-powered F-150 at Dearborn Truck Plant and said it will add an extra 45,000 units next year, ""enabled by a new third crew of 1,200 employees.""

Ford officially ended production this year of the 2025 F-150 Lightning, built at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, after two fires earlier this fall destroyed part of the Novelis aluminum plant in New York. Novelis supplies Ford with much of the aluminum used in the bodies of its pickups and SUVs. The fire created a shortage of aluminum and caused some production disruptions to the Lightning and Ford SUVs.

On Dec. 15, Ford said the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center on its BlueOval campus in Stanton, Tennessee, near Memphis, is now renamed Tennessee Truck Plant. The facility will produce ""all-new Built Ford Tough truck models"" starting in 2029.

Frick declined to provide any details as to what kinds of new pickups these will be, other than to say they are new affordable gas-powered trucks that will broaden Ford’s lineup and extend its market leadership, replacing the previously planned next-generation electric truck.

Ford plans to hire at least 2,300 people in Tennessee to start, he said.

Ford will make Ohio Assembly Plant a central hub for Ford Pro, its commercial vehicle unit. There, Ford will be assembling the new gasoline- and hybrid-powered commercial van starting in 2029, alongside Super Duty chassis cabs. Frick said Ford employs 1,700 people in Ohio and he had no update on how many new people Ford plans to hire there.

A new business in Kentucky and Michigan

Ford said it will convert its BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale, Kentucky, from a facility producing batteries for EVs to one that makes battery energy storage systems, effectively launching a new business segment for Ford. These systems are an energy storage solution for such customers as data centers, utilities and large-scale industrial and commercial businesses, Lisa Drake, Ford's vice president of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems, told the media on Dec. 15.

Drake said Ford studied the industry and can apply its manufacturing expertise and licensed advanced battery technology to start building the energy storage units within 18 months, positioning the company to capture a share of the growing U.S. battery energy storage systems market. Ford currently plans to deploy at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.

Last week, Ford, SK On, SK Battery America and BlueOval SK entered into a joint venture disposition agreement where a Ford subsidiary will independently own and operate the Kentucky battery plants. SK On will fully own and operate the Tennessee battery plant.

That production change at SK Battery Park will mean some 1,600 employees there will be laid off, but then Ford will hire 2,100 new people and the former workers are welcome to apply for one of the new jobs.

The move will allow Ford to use excess EV battery capacity at the facility to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream. Ford plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business there.

In Michigan, Ford's BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall will produce smaller Amp-hour cells for use in residential energy storage solutions. Ford said the facility remains on track to begin manufacturing LFP prismatic battery cells in 2026 to power Ford’s upcoming midsize electric truck, to be built at Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky in 2027 and to be the first model on the new Universal EV Platform. Ford has said that pickup will start at around $30,000, a steal in today's world when the average new car costs nearly $50,000.

Ford's future powertrain plans

Frick said the automaker plans to expand its future hybrid powertrain offerings with a range of executions based on customer needs such as hybrids that deliver economy, performance and exportable power. The carmaker will also build larger trucks and SUVs to better align with customer demand for capability, towing and range.

That includes adding extended-range electric options to its lineup, one of which will be the previously mentioned next-generation F-150 Lightning. There had been reports last month that Ford leaders were considering killing the Lightning due to slowing EV sales in the United States.

In the third quarter, Ford reported it sold 10,005 Lightnings, a 39.7% gain from the year-ago period and a record for the company. The sales were largely aided by the fact that a $7,500 federal tax credit was due to expire at the end of September, so buyers rushed to take advantage of it while they could. Ford reported Lightning sales from January through the end of the quarter are 23,034 sold, a 1% year-over-year gain.

Ford will shift the Lightning to become an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV).

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer, in a statement. “Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love — 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration — and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive. It will be an incredibly versatile tool delivered in a capital-efficient way.”""

Frick told reporters that, for the average customer, the next generation F-150 Lightning will go nine to 10 days on electricity alone. He said Ford took its time evaluating the market before making these decisions.

“These are big decisions that we believe will pay off for years to come for our customers, our employees, American jobs and manufacturing,” Frick told reporters. “Ford is following the customer. We are looking at the market as it is today, not just as everyone predicted it to be five years ago. Customers want the freedom to choose the powertrain that fits their lifestyle and work and that is affordable.""

Ford kills a commercial van

Ford said it no longer intends to produce the previously planned new electric commercial van for Europe. It will maintain its full lineup of electrified vans for that market, though. Ford recently announced some changes to its business in Europe, including new leadership and bringing a new generation of multi-energy vehicles to customers. Ford also announced a strategic partnership with Renault to collaborate in the development of commercial and passenger EVs.

In North America, Ford said it will replace a planned electric commercial van with ""affordable"" hybrid and gasoline models of a commercial van, to be assembled at Ford’s Ohio Assembly Plant.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/18/PDTF/87333857007-20251116-ford-hq-opening-public-tours-fg-16.jpg?crop=2399,1351,x0,y124&width=2399&height=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-16 20:57:34.241284

I tried my best to make the case for not charging into the EV world so hard, almost a year and half ago. but I’m just a media member who, apparently, didn’t know any better. I wrote an open letter to Jim Farley. Ford’s CEO trying to make the case that you could not force a market that was not there. I wish they had listened, much of this almost $20,000,000,000 might have been saved. If you didn’t see the letter I wrote, you can view it here:

An Open Letter to Ford CEO Jim Farley →

In the letter published on July 9, 2024, I wrote: “With all due respect, you cannot force a market that is not there.” I warned: “Americans will push back if you try to force them to do anything, but if you try to come between the people and their love affair with cars, you’ll become their adversary.”

What spurred my letter was Mr. Farley saying, in a TV interview: “The first thing we have to do is really put all of our capital toward smaller, more affordable EVs.” In my letter, I questioned: “Are you 100% sure you want to putall Ford’s cash toward smaller, more affordable EVs as you stated? Is there evidence people will buy these small electrics?”

In closing, I said: “If you take anything away from this today, let it be that you cannot force electric cars on the public. The market will decide when it is time to make the transition: not you, not Ford, not the government.”

Ford Motor Company Chief Communications Officer, Mark Truby, whom I knew from my days of being the Ford Dealer Council Chairman called me and he agreed to come on the Car Pro Show. Here is the interview we did:

Interview with Ford Motor Company COO, Mark Truby →

So, here we are. The company I represented as a Dealer and franchise holder is writing off $20 billion dollars, enough to buy about 400,000 new vehicles at today’s $50,000 average price. That was an expensive lesson.

In the end, this isn’t about being right, and it certainly isn’t about saying “I told you so.” It’s about listening—listening to customers, to the dealers on the ground, and to the market itself. Twenty billion dollars is not an accounting entry; it is factories that could have been built, vehicles that could have been sold, and American jobs that could have been secured. The lesson here is not that electric vehicles are a mistake, because they are not. The lesson is that markets move at the pace of the customer, not the pace of press releases, boardrooms, or government mandates. The transition will happen when buyers are ready—and when it does, the companies that listened instead of lectured will be the ones still standing.

Monday’s Announcement From Ford

Ford Motor Co. is sharply curtailing its once-ambitious electric vehicle expansion and redirecting capital and factory capacity toward gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles, a strategic reversal the company says is necessary to stem mounting losses in an EV market that has not matured as quickly or as broadly as expected.

The Dearborn-based automaker said the revised strategy includes canceling a planned next-generation electric commercial van that had been scheduled for production in Avon Lake, Ohio, beginning in 2028. Instead, workers at the Ohio Assembly plant will build a next-generation gasoline and hybrid van starting in 2029, a move Ford says better aligns with customer demand and profitability targets.

Because the company now expects to produce fewer EVs than originally planned, Ford also said it will redirect a portion of its battery manufacturing capacity toward energy storage systems, a rapidly growing segment driven by data centers, utilities and commercial customers seeking backup and grid-balancing solutions.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

Ford said the changes are expected to begin narrowing the financial losses of its Model e electric vehicle unit as soon as next year, with profitability targeted by 2029. The EV division lost about $5 billion in 2024, underscoring the pressure automakers face as EV pricing, incentives and demand remain volatile.

“These are big decisions that we believe will pay off for years to come for our customers, our employees, American jobs and manufacturing,” Andrew Frick, president of Ford’s gasoline and EV businesses, told reporters during a conference call. Frick said the revised plan reflects a clearer-eyed assessment of consumer buying patterns, particularly in trucks and commercial vehicles, where hybrids are gaining traction faster than fully electric models.

Despite the pullback, Ford emphasized it is not abandoning electrification altogether. The company said about half of its global vehicle volume will consist of hybrids, extended-range EVs and full battery-electric vehicles by 2030, up from roughly 17 percent today. Hybrids, in particular, are playing a central role in the transition strategy, offering improved fuel efficiency without the charging and range concerns that continue to deter some buyers.

As part of the restructuring, Ford said it plans to add about 2,100 jobs at a battery plant in Kentucky that will now be dedicated in part to the energy storage business. The facility will be wholly owned by a Ford subsidiary following the termination of a joint venture with South Korean battery maker SK On.

In Tennessee, Ford said its assembly site at the sprawling BlueOval City complex will employ about 2,300 workers when production begins in 2029. The company previously said the entire BlueOval City campus would eventually support about 6,000 jobs but had not provided a breakdown for the assembly plant itself.

Ford said the strategic shift will result in special charges totaling about $19.5 billion, largely recorded in the fourth quarter. At the same time, the automaker raised its 2025 financial outlook, projecting adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about $7 billion, up from a prior range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. The company cited continued underlying business strength and cost improvements for the more optimistic guidance.

One of the most striking elements of the announcement is Ford’s decision to discontinue the F-150 Lightning, its all-electric pickup that executives once compared to the Model T in historical importance. The Lightning will end production after less than four years, following an October halt triggered by a fire at a supplier’s aluminum plant. Ford said it opted not to restart Lightning production, choosing instead to focus resources on more profitable gasoline and hybrid versions of the F-150.

Rather than producing a next-generation all-electric Lightning at BlueOval City, Ford plans to reimagine the pickup as an extended-range electric vehicle assembled in Michigan. Extended-range EVs use a gasoline engine as a generator to supplement battery power, addressing range anxiety while reducing fuel consumption.

Ford did not provide a timeline for the launch of the extended-range Lightning replacement.

The decision mirrors a move by Stellantis earlier this year to cancel a fully electric Ram pickup in favor of an extended-range version. That truck, now known as the Ram 1500 REV, is scheduled to debut in 2026. General Motors has also slowed EV investment while boosting production of gasoline-powered vehicles, reflecting an industry-wide recalibration.

BlueOval City, originally envisioned as Ford’s largest and most efficient manufacturing hub with EVs at its core, will now open in 2029 producing what the company described as “affordable, gas-powered” trucks. A Ford spokesperson said the newly named Tennessee Truck Plant will build “a model we don’t have today,” signaling a fresh entry rather than a direct replacement for an existing vehicle.

Ford’s new energy storage business will manufacture lithium iron phosphate prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot direct-current container systems at the Kentucky plant. Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems, said the company expects to invest about $2 billion to retool the facility for energy storage production.

Ford also plans to produce smaller-capacity cells for residential energy storage at its battery plant in Marshall, Michigan. That site is scheduled to begin producing lithium iron phosphate prismatic cells in 2026 for use in an upcoming midsize electric pickup.

The start of production at a second Kentucky battery plant, which would be owned by the same Ford subsidiary as the first, remains indefinitely postponed.

Ford’s retrenchment underscores the challenges facing the auto industry as it balances regulatory pressure, capital intensity and uneven consumer adoption of electric vehicles. While EVs remain a long-term priority, Ford and its rivals are increasingly betting that hybrids and extended-range models will serve as a more practical bridge to an electric future, one that customers appear more willing to buy into today.",https://www.carpro.com/hubfs/ford-f150-lightning-backup-power-statefair%20(1).jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:01:05.439093

This is due to domestic policy measures such as restrictions on Russian-enriched uranium imports and incentives for Western-sourced fuel under the Inflation Reduction Act.
“US utilities often pay a premium for contracted US domestic supply to meet energy security requirements and access tax credits,” he added.
“This premium reflects the US reliance on imports for over 95% of its uranium needs, with US domestic production contributing less than 1% of global supply.
“Anticipated benefits include fast-track permitting, financial support through low-interest loans and grants, and prioritisation within domestic supply chains, especially for US regulated utilities and Department of War purchases,” Lane said.","US reinstatement of uranium as critical mineral unlocks suite of Federal incentives

Uranium prices forecast to rise as more nuclear reactors come online

Domestic or Western-origin material could command significant premium to secure supply

If the prospect of increased demand for the energy metal wasn’t enough, the US Geological Survey officially reinstated uranium into its 2025 list of critical minerals on November 7, 2025.

The reversal, which follows uranium’s removal in 2022, unlocks a whole suite of federal incentives that are designed to encourage and accelerate domestic exploration, development, and production.

These include expedited permitting under FAST-41, which has already seen several critical minerals projects accepted into the program, eligibility for grants from the Department of Energy or Defense, and priority access to federal programs.

Uranium is currently trading between US$75 and US$82 per pound on the spot market and commanding a long-term price of about US$85/lb according to Cameco.

American Uranium (ASX:AMU) executive director Bruce Lane told Stockhead that domestically produced uranium in the US commands a premium over global spot prices.

This is due to domestic policy measures such as restrictions on Russian-enriched uranium imports and incentives for Western-sourced fuel under the Inflation Reduction Act.

“US utilities often pay a premium for contracted US domestic supply to meet energy security requirements and access tax credits,” he added.

“This premium reflects the US reliance on imports for over 95% of its uranium needs, with US domestic production contributing less than 1% of global supply.

“For US-based explorers, this creates a strong incentive to develop low-cost ISR (in-situ recovery) projects, particularly those with logistical advantages.”

US nuclear reactors require about 45-48Mlb of U3O8 annually while domestic output was just 677,000lb in 2024 and is projected to reach 1.5-3Mlb this year.

Things are likely to improve further in 2026 with even the most optimistic forecasts estimating yield at 4 to 8Mlb.

Projects located in Wyoming, such as AMU’s Lo Herma, benefit from reduced transport costs to conversion facilities compared to international sources, supporting competitive all-in sustaining costs (AISC) often below US$40/lb.

Priced to deliver

The current pricing makes restarts and expansions of existing ISR operations – along with some rare new projects – generally viable, especially for those with low all-in sustaining costs and favourable logistics.

It isn’t quite as rosy a picture yet for new greenfield developments with Lane saying they would typically require sustained prices nearer to US$100/lb to offset rising costs in exploration, labour, and regulatory compliance.

“Importantly, pricing must provide a margin to the company, surplus capital to continue investing in exploration and growth, and returns that justify development risk,” he added.

“Investment capital for new builds generally demands higher returns to compensate for these risks.”

Potential new developments might not have to wait too long for uranium pricing to become more favourable with forecasts suggesting that spot prices could reach US$95-105/lb by mid-2026 and potentially US$140/lb by late 2027.

A sign of this has been the steady rise in term contract pricing over the past six months due to cautious utility contracting and ongoing supply constraints.

“A return to full replacement rate and inventory restocking by utilities globally, led by the US, will likely drive uranium term prices higher against a backdrop of ongoing tight supply.”

Western-origin material could also command significant premiums as utilities prioritise secure supply over cost, which isn’t too much of a burden given that fuel costs make up only a small part of the running cost of a nuclear power plant.

Benefitting Australian players

Uranium’s expected price growth and its inclusion on the USGS Critical Minerals List will be of significant benefit to Australian uranium explorers.

The latter unlocks federal incentives under legislation such as the Energy Act of 2020, the Defense Production Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Anticipated benefits include fast-track permitting, financial support through low-interest loans and grants, and prioritisation within domestic supply chains, especially for US regulated utilities and Department of War purchases,” Lane said.

“These measures aim to reduce permitting timelines, lower capital expenditure, lower the cost of capital, reduce development risks and strengthen project economics for US-based ISR developments.”

“US-focused ISR projects remain central to addressing domestic shortfalls, given their cost advantages and proximity to conversion facilities.”

It certainly doesn’t hurt that the US government’s US$80bn agreement with Westinghouse could bring as many as 10 new large-scale reactors online by 2030.

With each reactor adding roughly 500,000lb to annual U3O8 demand, this could significantly increase US uranium demand.

This building momentum is music to American Uranium’s ears as it progresses development of its Lo Herma ISR project in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin.

Lo Herma currently has a resource of 6.21Mt at 630ppm eU3O8, or 8.57Mlb of contained uranium, a third of which sits within the higher confidence indicated category.

An exploration target of 6.16-10.95Mlb U3O8 at a grade range of 500-700ppm offers potential for resource growth with more drilling.

The company recently completed hydrogeological testing that successfully demonstrated sustained flows and minimal aquifer drawdown.

Resource expansion drilling is also progressing as planned with continuity of mineralised sands and redox conditions observed in the areas north of the proposed Mine Units 1 and 2.

,American Energy,2025-12-17 00:55:19+00:00,the Guardian,Democratic senators investigate data centers' effects on electricity prices - The Guardian,"Guardian staff, Sanya Mansoor",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/data-centers-consumer-prices,"Three Democratic US senators announced on Tuesday that they are investigating whether big tech companies are passing the soaring utility costs of “energy-guzzling” data centers on to ordinary Americans.
About one-third of the country’s more than 4,000 data centers are located in three states: Virginia, Texas and California.
At least one study questions the link between data centers and increasing electricity prices.
A recent Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study found that data centers may have actually helped reduce average retail electricity prices.
Local efforts across the country have blocked or delayed roughly $64bn in data center projects, according to a report published earlier this year by Data Center Watch.","Three Democratic US senators announced on Tuesday that they are investigating whether big tech companies are passing the soaring utility costs of “energy-guzzling” data centers on to ordinary Americans. The trio sent letters to the heads of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta as well as the data center operators CoreWeave, Digital Realty and Equinix asking for greater transparency, cost-sharing and accountability.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut wrote that they were alarmed by reports that these data centers caused residential electricity bills to “skyrocket”. Regions with significant data center activity have already endured price increases by as much as 267% over the past five years, the three lawmakers wrote. According to the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency, the average cost of a US family’s electricity bill had risen 7% year-over-year as of September.

“Through these utility price increases, American families bankroll the electricity costs of trillion-dollar tech companies,” they stated, demanding that data centers and tech companies “pay their fair share of their electricity rates” and “a greater share of the costs upfront for future energy usage”.

Lawmakers asked companies for more information about their current and projected number of data centers, and their energy usage, as well as what actions have been taken to prevent electricity costs from being passed on to consumer energy bills.

They also inquired about the tax deductions or other financial incentives these companies received from state and local governments, as well as payments they made to lobbyists and consultants to advocate for the construction of data centers. They requested a response no later than 12 January.

The rapid expansion of AI – and the fact that a single data center can “use enough electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes”, according to the senators – means that utility companies have spent billions of dollars building new transmission lines and power plants. Data centers could account for 12% of the country’s power consumption by 2028, according to the US Department of Energy. About one-third of the country’s more than 4,000 data centers are located in three states: Virginia, Texas and California.

At least one study questions the link between data centers and increasing electricity prices. A recent Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study found that data centers may have actually helped reduce average retail electricity prices. Experts say utility companies can spread fixed infrastructure costs among more power customers.

In the letters, lawmakers highlighted specific examples of tech companies publicly insisting they do not want taxpayers to be overburdened by data centers, while simultaneously opposing state and local efforts to regulate them.

“Tech companies have paid lip service in support of covering their data centers’ energy costs, but their actions have shown the opposite,” the letters noted.

Google, Amazon, CoreWeave and Equinix did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty said in an emailed statement that it “looks forward to working with all elected officials to continue to invest in the digital infrastructure required to support America’s leadership in technology”. Meta and Microsoft declined to comment.

While the senators’ letters focus mostly on the financial burden of data centers, the massive structures’ enormous energy usage also comes with a significant climate cost. A Cornell study published last month in Nature Sustainability found that data centers could annually consume as much water as 6 million-10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 5m-10m cars.

Opposition to the environmental and financial costs associated with data centers is growing in the US. Local efforts across the country have blocked or delayed roughly $64bn in data center projects, according to a report published earlier this year by Data Center Watch.

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.""

President Donald Trump's administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states – Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin – have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday's separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden's “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent – to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

(WKRC) — The Ford Motor Company has pulled the plug on its prized F-150 Lightning, a vehicle once expected to define the American electric truck industry.

According to NPR, Ford ceased production of the Lightning in order to shift its focus toward hybrid vehicles and a future line of small, low-cost electric vehicles. The report states that the battery plants originally intended to supply Ford trucks will instead begin delivering batteries for the electric grid.

Ford explained to NPR that the decision was driven by the company’s inability to find a profitable strategy for the Lightning, along with a lack of consumer enthusiasm for full-size electric pickup trucks.

WDRB reported Tuesday that all 1,600 employees at Ford’s new electric battery manufacturing facility will be laid off before the company converts the plant to produce batteries for utilities and data centers. The company announced Monday that it aims to begin shipping the battery storage systems from its plants in Michigan and Kentucky in late 2027 as part of what it called a shift to “higher-return opportunities.”

Ford expects to take a $19.5 billion profit hit as it transitions away from the EV business, according to the report.

“Instead of plowing billions into the future knowing these large EVs will never make money, we are pivoting,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.

According to WDRB, Ford now plans to hire 2,100 employees in the redesigned Glendale plant, adding that those laid off will have an “opportunity to apply” for the newly created jobs.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable Ford. The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids, and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business,” Farley said in a press release.

When Ford first announced the F-150 Lightning with an affordable price of $40,000, it was unable to sell it at that price once production began, NPR reported.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Ford has lost a staggering $13 billion in its EV business since 2023.

With the departure of the F-150 Lightning, American consumers in the market for a full-size electric pickup truck now have the following options:

The Chevrolet Silverado EV

The GMC Sierra EV

The Tesla Cybertruck

Representatives Samara Heavrin and Steve Bratcher, two Republican Kentucky House members representing Hardin County, issued a statement to WDRB expressing concern for workers who may lose their jobs:

“We are optimistic about Ford Motor Company’s decision to take over the Glendale facility and transition the project toward energy storage, particularly as initial plans for the project have faced significant challenges from the outset. At the same time, optimism must be matched with both caution and accountability, and we will be watching closely to ensure commitments are met and honored.”",https://local12.com/resources/media2/16x9/858/1320/0x2/90/c5218b67-c1af-4f92-99a9-955e7fbd582e-Screenshot20251216062815.png,N,,2025-12-17 02:01:27.355008

A federal judge issued a preliminary order directing the federal government to release NEVI funding, and the Trump administration restarted the program in August.","A coalition of environmental advocacy groups sued the Trump administration today to force the release of more than $2 billion in federal funding through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program. The program provides money to local and state agencies and tribes to fund community charging and transportation corridor projects. So far, the federal government has awarded more than 140 grants through the program, totaling nearly $1.8 billion, to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase mobility for people who drive electric or alternatively fueled vehicles.

Under the Trump administration, however, those funds have been frozen. As a result, transportation projects across the country are in jeopardy. Some that have already received money for design phases have been halted partway through.

The Sierra Club, Climate Solutions, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Earthjustice joined together to sue the administration over the funding freeze. “[Gasoline-powered] vehicles have a baked-in advantage, in … that we have trillions upon trillions of dollars of infrastructure designed to serve those vehicles,” Zachary Fabish, a staff attorney for the Sierra Club said. “There are gas stations everywhere. There are not charging stations everywhere. That's something that this legislation was supposed to address.”

Pollution from burning fossil fuels to power vehicles contributes to the climate crisis, harms the health of millions of Americans, and is especially dangerous for marginalized communities across the nation that live next to major freight corridors. The transportation sector is the largest greenhouse-gas-emitting industry in the United States, contributing between 15 and 20 percent of emissions. One study found that every year, almost 30,000 deaths are associated with fine particulate matter from the transportation sector.

“This is not just a climate change issue. It is not just about people who want to drive EVs. This is a public health issue. [And] this is a democracy issue.”

While demand for electric vehicles is up, the infrastructure needed to make them competitive at a larger scale is still lacking. “This is not just a climate change issue. It is not just about people who want to drive EVs. This is a public health issue,” said Fabish. “[And] this is a democracy issue.”

The Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program was created when Congress, during the Biden administration, passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The new legislation appropriated $2.5 billion for the program over five years, delivering one of two major federal funding programs for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The other—the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program—appropriated $5 billion to build electric vehicle charging stations along major highway corridors and to enable long-distance EV travel across the country.

In May, the Sierra Club, NRDC, and other coalition partners filed a similar lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s freeze of NEVI. A federal judge issued a preliminary order directing the federal government to release NEVI funding, and the Trump administration restarted the program in August.

As the Adams Administration concludes, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) celebrates a record of accomplishments that have kept New Yorkers safe, strengthened critical infrastructure, and advanced climate resilience across all five boroughs. The agency has delivered unprecedented investments and innovations to protect residents, improve quality of life, and prepare the city for the challenges of climate change. Today, NYC Chief Climate Officer and DEP Commissioner Rohit T. Aggarwala released a list of key achievements, including bolstering coastal resiliency, mitigating flood risks, preserving the ecological health of New York Harbor, conserving the city’s vital tap water supply, and curbing greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution—milestones that reflect the city’s ongoing commitment to environmental protection, public health, and a more sustainable, resilient future for all New Yorkers.

“We took office with a simple promise: to ‘Get Stuff Done,’ and, four years later, our administration can say that we delivered on that promise every day for working-class New Yorkers,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams. “We drove shootings to record lows and pushed jobs and small businesses to record highs. We rewrote the playbook on homelessness and mental health to finally get New Yorkers living on our streets the help they need, and, after decades of half-measures, passed historic housing legislation to turn New York into a ‘City of Yes.’ We overhauled the way our students learn to read and do math, cut the cost of childcare, and forgave medical debt. We eliminated taxes for low-income families, launched free universal after-school programming, and constructed over 2,900 rain gardens and infiltration basins on sidewalks across the city. We got scaffolding off our buildings, trash bags off our streets, and opened up new public spaces for New Yorkers to enjoy. The haters may have doubted us, but the results are clear. On issue after issue, we brought common-sense leadership to create a safer, more affordable city, and our work has changed our city for the better; it will stand the test of time because we made New York City the best place to live and raise a family.”

“Over the past four years, we’ve confronted extreme weather, historic underinvestment, and unprecedented fiscal pressures—and still strengthened the systems and services millions of New Yorkers rely on every day. These achievements will safeguard our city for generations to come,” said Commissioner Aggarwala. “DEP has delivered record capital investments, upgraded assets and critical facilities, advanced new technologies, embraced innovation and smart planning, expanded protections for vulnerable communities, improved resilience in every borough, and reinforced the long‑term reliability of our drinking water supply. This legacy is one of progress, performance, and partnership.”

Record Capital Investments

$3.221 billion in FY25 capital commitments: the highest level since 2007. This record investment allowed DEP to accelerate long-delayed projects, modernize aging infrastructure, and expand resilience programs.

$8.1 billion in commitments between FY23–FY25: the strongest three-year total in nearly two decades. These commitments funded stormwater upgrades, coastal resiliency projects, and water supply improvements, ensuring that New Yorkers benefit from infrastructure designed for the realities of climate change.

Protecting New Yorkers from Flooding

Stormwater Analysis: For the first time, DEP formally embraced flooding prevention as a core mission. The 2024 Stormwater Analysis, which is the first building block for the master plan, identified 86 priority drainage areas and examined case studies in neighborhoods like Knickerbocker Avenue and Jewel Streets, laying the foundation for a citywide master plan.

Prospect Park: DEP will invest up to a $50 million investment to build Brooklyn’s first Bluebelt in Prospect Park. This initiative will not only improve drainage and prevent flooding in the park, but also protect surrounding neighborhoods from flash flooding, as well as the zoo.

Jewel Streets Plan: DEP, along with DDC, DOT and HPD, are investing $146 million to install a comprehensive new drainage system, including a network of Bluebelts, to protect the low-lying neighborhood from flooding.

Knickerbocker Avenue, Bushwick: A $390 million investment—$335 million from DEP and the remainder from DOT—will modernize sewers dating back to the early 1900s. Chronic flooding has plagued Bushwick for decades; this project will finally deliver relief while also replacing lead service lines at no cost to property owners.

Southeast Queens Initiative: DEP continues to make progress on the $2.78 billion, multi-decade program to provide long-term flooding relief through the buildout of a comprehensive storm sewer network. Since 2015, the agency has invested $1.51 billion, completed 26 neighborhood projects, and has 7 more under construction, with 15 additional projects in design and development—including a $79 million triple-barrel sewer beneath Idlewild Park that rivals a subway tunnel in scale.

Dyker Heights: DEP is upsizing key sewer pipes to improve drainage capacity. The $62 million project is currently in design with DDC and will address recurring flooding issues in this residential neighborhood.

Kissena Park Bluebelt: DEP has set aside almost $55 million to collaborate with NYC Parks to create a new Bluebelt, holding regular community meetings to ensure local input. Bluebelts use natural wetlands to manage stormwater, providing both drainage and ecological benefits.

Bluebelt Expansion: DEP completed a $110 million expansion of the New Creek Bluebelt, protecting Mid-Island communities from flooding while creating green space and wildlife habitat. Recently wrapped construction on a separate $14 million Bluebelt that will connect to the New Creek system, and work on more than 25 Bluebelts is currently under way.

New Dorp Beach: Completed an $84 million infrastructure project that installed new storm sewers and catch basins in a coastal area of Staten Island that was devastated by Superstorm Sandy.

Porous Pavement: $32.6 million to install seven miles of porous pavement—the longest stretch in city history—in Kensington and Borough Park, Brooklyn. As of December 2025, six of the seven miles are constructed. This innovative material allows water to drain directly into the ground, reducing flooding and improving harbor health.

Cloudburst Project: Completed the city’s first Cloudburst initiative, at a cost of $6 million, at the NYCHA South Jamaica Houses. Using stormwater management tools, including green and grey infrastructure, the assets have enough volume to capture 330,000 gallons per rain event, and manage up to 3.5 million gallons annually.

Maintenance and Innovation

Catch Basin Maintenance: DEP launched a data-driven inspection program to prioritize flood-prone basins, reducing resolution times by 30%. With nine new catch basin cleaning trucks, and expanded staff, clogged basins are now cleared in under three days.

Sewer Maintenance: Over 2,500 miles of sewers were cleaned over the last four years.

Leak Detection: DEP’s leak detection unit has proactively inspected almost 5,000 miles of water mains, finding small leaks before they become disruptive breaks.

FloodNet Sensors: Installed in neighborhoods vulnerable to high tides, storm surge, and stormwater runoff. There are currently 325 sensors citywide, with a goal of scaling up to 500. DEP uses the data to identify and track street flooding and to guide planning and operational efforts aimed at addressing chronic stormwater flooding.

Sewer Monitors: Installed 241 sewer monitors citywide to measure water levels and in some locations flow in near real-time. These devices will help the agency’s engineers better understand the performance of the sewer system during dry and wet weather, eventually leading to smart sewers.

Slotted Manhole Covers: Installed 507 slotted manhole covers, which are paired with newly designed catch basins. These innovative covers ensure uninterrupted stormwater drainage flow to the sewers, even when debris obstructs curbside basins at flood-prone intersections.

Coastal Resilience

Bureau of Coastal Resilience: Established to centralize and streamline efforts to protect New Yorkers from coastal storms, ensuring coordination across agencies and projects.

East Side Coastal Resiliency: Completed the first phase of this $1.45 billion project ahead of schedule and under budget. ESCR will use elevated parkland, floodwalls, landscaped berms, and 18 swinging or sliding floodgates to create a continuous line of protection against sea-level rise and the more powerful coastal storms driven by climate change.

Brooklyn Bridge-Montgomery Coastal Resiliency: Construction is underway, with completion expected in 2026. This $350 million project will fortify Lower Manhattan against storm surges.

Battery Coastal Resilience: A $200 million project to protect 100,000 residents, 300,000 jobs, and 12,000 businesses in Lower Manhattan.

Red Hook Coastal Resiliency: Broke ground on this $218 million public safety project that will protect residents and businesses in the vulnerable waterfront neighborhood.

Cleaner Waterways and Greener Infrastructure

Green Infrastructure: Since 2022, DEP has built over 2,900 rain gardens and infiltration basins within city sidewalks, plus 170 stormwater systems on public properties including schools, parks and NYCHA developments. Nearly 40 private projects have been incentivized through grants.

Gowanus Canal CSO Tanks: DEP broke ground and has made significant construction progress on the $1.6 billion project to prevent 12 million gallons of sewage overflow into the Gowanus Canal during storms. The project will also create 4 acres of new public waterfront space.

Newtown Creek CSO Tunnel: DEP negotiated a consent order modification, securing $3.2 billion in funding for a storage tunnel that will capture more sewage and deliver long-term ecosystem benefits.

Whitestone and College Point Drainage Upgrades: $128 million and $139 million projects added miles of new sewers, eliminating millions of gallons of sewage discharge into Flushing Bay annually.

Tibbets Brook Daylighting: After years of stalemate, DEP reached agreement with CSX Transportation to acquire land critical to the project, which will improve Harlem River water quality and add green space.

Green Playgrounds: DEP partnered with the Trust for Public Land to open 29 new Green Infrastructure playgrounds that absorb stormwater and reduce flooding in neighborhoods across the city.

Renewable Energy and Climate Leadership

Newtown Creek Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) Gas-to-Grid: This innovative project, the first co-digestion and gas-to-grid project at a WRRF in New York State, has successfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 28,000 metric tons in 2024—the same as removing 6,700 cars from NYC roads annually. By 2030, the program is expected to generate energy to heat over 35,000 homes and reduce GHG emissions by an estimated 170,000 metric tons. Since the project commissioning, the facility has recycled over 400,000 wet tons of food scraps and generated enough energy to heat over 12,000 homes.

North River WRRF Cogeneration: Substantial completion of $300 million cogeneration project that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve facility resilience.

Wastewater Treatment

Resiliency Upgrades: DEP has invested $180 million to upgrade eight wastewater resource recovery facilities and two pumping stations, including floodproofing equipment, hardening infrastructure, elevating power systems, and other measures to protect against future storms.

Hunts Point WRRF: Constructing four 125-foot-tall tanks that each hold 3.2 million gallons of sludge at a cost of $368 million to expand capacity for converting organic waste into energy and reduce fugitive methane emissions. This will make the wastewater treatment process more efficient and reliable and to address quality of life concerns from the surrounding community. Also, completed $53M in resiliency upgrades to fortify the facility against severe storms.

Customer Assistance and Fiscal Responsibility

Water Bill Amnesty Program: The largest in city history, delivering $22 million in interest relief and $8 million in billing credits to low-income New Yorkers who fell behind during the pandemic.

Lead Service Line Replacement: Secured $72 million in federal funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to remove lead water service lines from private properties in low-income and environmental justice neighborhoods. The program started in the Bronx and has recently expanded to reach additional communities, with Queens and Brooklyn targeted for 2026.

Lien Sale: Restarting the sale in 2025 helped limit this year’s rate increase to just 3.7%, instead of the 8.5% initially projected. The process brought $374 million in overdue revenue back into good standing—including $180 million in direct payments, $172 million in payment agreements, and $22 million from the sale itself. DEP, working with DOF and HPD, conducted a record outreach effort: nearly 500,000 mailings, 77,000 phone calls, 6,500 door knocks, and dozens of community events with Council members.

Recouping Revenue: DEP’s renewed focus on its largest delinquent customers—including the Port Authority of NY NJ and the MTA—resulted in amicable resolutions that will strengthen the agency’s financial foundation and help fund the water and wastewater system for years to come. More than half of the top 35 delinquent accounts from 2022 have either resolved their delinquency or are in active payment agreements. DEP continues to engage in negotiations and has launched a new Key Accounts Group to better focus its ongoing efforts and ensure all customers pay their fair share.

Investing In and Managing NYC’s Drinking Water

Delaware Aqueduct: Continued progress on the final phase of DEP’s largest‑ever repair effort, the $2 billion Delaware Aqueduct Repair Project. Once complete, it will prevent 35 million gallons of drinking water from leaking into the ground in upstate New York each day and ensure that New Yorkers continue to receive some of the highest‑quality drinking water in the world for generations to come.

City Tunnel 3: Completed excavation of two deep water tunnel shafts in Maspeth—Shaft 17B at roughly 780 feet and Shaft 18B at about 720 feet. Once operational, these shafts will connect to the Queens–Brooklyn section of City Tunnel 3 and help distribute water to surrounding neighborhoods.

Drought Management: In 2024, DEP successfully managed the first citywide drought in 20 years, maintaining a safe water supply for drinking and fire protection. Initiated a public information campaign to spread awareness and promote conservation.

Kensico–Eastview Connection Tunnel: A $1.9 billion project broke ground, adding resilience and redundancy to the water supply system.

Hillview Reservoir Reconstruction: A $1.2 billion modernization project broke ground, upgrading treatment facilities and infrastructure at a reservoir that provides 90% of NYC’s daily drinking water.

Schoharie Reservoir and Gilboa Dam: Completed $400 million upgrades to strengthen northernmost water supply facilities.

Watershed Region: Committed $228 million to farm and forest landowners in the watershed region to protect water quality while supporting the economic viability of agriculture and forestry in the area.

Automatic Meter Reading Modernization: Began a three-year effort to upgrade 600,000 devices citywide, improving leak detection and enhancing customer service.

Protecting Public Health and Improving Quality of Life

Citizens’ Complaint Program: Managed the significant expansion of this program—which targets illegal idling by trucks and buses—with more than 150,000 complaint submissions in 2025. Submitted video evidence is now available online, helping to streamline and speed the settlement of cases.

Noise Camera Program: Installed 12 cameras citywide to target illegally modified vehicles that violate the Noise Code, resulting in more than 1,600 summonses issued in 2025.

NYC Noise App: DEP launched a free mobile app for iPhone and Android that lets residents record decibel levels, classify noise types, and visualize noise in their surroundings. The data collected helps DEP analyze citywide noise patterns, identify hotspots, and guide targeted enforcement efforts.

Adopt-A-Catch Basin: A new pilot initiative designed to empower community members to take an active role in reducing local street flooding. The program seeks volunteers to help keep catch basin grates clear of debris, ensuring that rainwater can flow freely into the City’s sewer system.

Borough Commissioners: Appointed senior staff to serve as the primary liaisons between DEP and communities, elected officials, and other stakeholders across the five boroughs.

Flooding Town Halls: DEP partnered with elected officials, community boards, and local organizations to hold flood kit distribution events and information sessions around the city, supplying flood barriers, sump pumps, and flood sensors. Since summer 2024, DEP has held 18 flood preparedness community meetings providing information and resources to thousands of New Yorkers.

Prior to carrying out projects like this one, federal law requires the Forest Service to notify the public and to study environmental impacts.

Forest Service crews began a salvage logging project near Poplar, North Carolina without undergoing necessary permitting processes. The work violated federal law and the agency’s own Nantahala-Pisgah Forest Plan, plaintiffs claimed.

Prior to carrying out projects like this one, federal law requires the Forest Service to notify the public and to study environmental impacts.

The Center for Biological Diversity, Southern Environmental Law Center and MountainTrue filed a lawsuit last month in the Western District of North Carolina to stop the logging, arguing it would harm wildlife and damage the ecosystem.

The proposed project was to take place in a designated North Carolina Natural Heritage Natural Area containing rare plants and sitting above the Nolichucky River — a popular whitewater rafting destination.

Days after the lawsuit was filed, the U.S. Forest Service cancelled the project and removed logging equipment from the site, leading the groups to withdraw their legal challenge, according to an announcement Monday.

“One of the country’s wildest gorges was spared additional harm because local communities spoke up,” said Will Harlan, Southeast director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “They saved an exceptional forest, imperiled wildlife, and a world-class river.”

Sam Evans, leader of SELC’s National Forests and Parks program, said North Carolina’s forests are full of natural wonders that support local economies and are sources of “immense” pride for neighboring communities.

“Public notice, transparency, and accountability are the absolute bare minimum of what the Forest Service owes our communities before it opens these forests for logging,” Evans said. “As long as the Forest Service refuses to do even that bare minimum, we are going to continue to haul them into court.”

Harlan called the decision a major victory for both the wildlife species who live in the Pisgah and humans who cherish the forest.

Despite the outcome, environmentalists cautioned against similar situations in the future due to the current political climate. Harlan emphasized unity to protect forests and waterways amid mounting pressure on public lands.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March directing federal administrators to immediately increase logging in national forests.

“Unfortunately, wild places will continue to be targeted by this administration, so we’ll continue standing shoulder to shoulder with communities to protect our beloved forests and rivers,” Harlan said.

If regulations eventually shift, they are unlikely to eliminate the need for responsible leak management — only to refine how it is measured or reported.
Even if the refrigerant regulations at the Federal level disappeared tomorrow, refrigerant costs and state-level requirements justify continuous automated monitoring and leak detection.
Operational resilience: Automatic leak detection (ALD) reduces downtime and has proven to significantly limit refrigerant losses.
While ALD systems cannot prevent the rare punctured or cracked pipe leak, these are the exceptions, not the rule.","Recent regulatory developments under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act have prompted questions across the refrigeration and facilities community about what is changing, what is not, and how organizations should respond. While the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing aspects of its approach, the foundational compliance requirements remain in place and continue to shape near-term planning decisions. This makes now the right time to begin ALD planning and implementation.

To clarify the current state of the regulation and its practical implications, there are two key points to understand:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a proposed rule under the AIM Act related to the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons. The proposal was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2025, and is available on epa.gov.

Current AIM Act requirements state that new HFC refrigeration systems larger than 1,500 pounds must have Automatic Leak Detection (ALD) installed within 30 days starting January 1, 2026. Existing systems installed between 2017 and 2025 with charges above 1,500 pounds must have ALD in place by January 1, 2027.

What does this mean for facility and energy leaders?

Things are in flux, but some things are not going to change. Refrigerants are expensive. Leaks are costly. And expectations for sustainable operations are not going away. Moreover, state-level regulations (e.g. CARB in California) will continue to aggressively promote ALD and refrigerant management.

For major grocers and multi-site operators with centralized refrigeration systems, waiting on the sidelines is not a strategy. Delaying ALD deployment or leak reduction programs only increases exposure to risk, operational costs and disruptions, and reputational damage. If regulations eventually shift, they are unlikely to eliminate the need for responsible leak management — only to refine how it is measured or reported.

Even if the refrigerant regulations at the Federal level disappeared tomorrow, refrigerant costs and state-level requirements justify continuous automated monitoring and leak detection. Being known as the “big leaker” in the supermarket industry is not a distinction anyone wants.

Why continuous monitoring and proactive action matter

Financial impact: Refrigerant loss and mandated leak checking in the absence of ALD drive higher operating costs.

Sustainability goals: Corporate carbon and ESG commitments remain important.

Regulatory readiness: Compliance frameworks take time to implement and remain aggressive at the state level — waiting until the EPA rules are final means falling behind.

Operational resilience: Automatic leak detection (ALD) reduces downtime and has proven to significantly limit refrigerant losses.

While ALD systems cannot prevent the rare punctured or cracked pipe leak, these are the exceptions, not the rule. For most multi-site operators, early refrigerant leak detection is the difference between a low-cost planned service call and a costly, emergency work order or even a catastrophic asset failure.

Phoenix can help

Phoenix Energy Technologies continues to help multi-site operators stay ahead of regulatory and operational challenges. Our ALD capabilities, built on Hussmann’s market-proven StoreConnect™ technology, deliver measurable cost savings, reduce refrigerant loss, and help teams meet compliance and sustainability goals with less effort. We provide early detection, lower operating costs, and requisite data for compliant regulatory filings.

We are monitoring the evolution of EPA’s rules and will provide updates when material changes occur. In the meantime, we encourage all multi-site operators with centralized refrigeration operations to continue planning and implementing their ALD and refrigerant management programs. The market is moving, and readiness takes time.

EPA is declining to oppose the temporary rollback of a challenged redesignation for ozone, while actively requesting the vacatur of the PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). While it seems unlikely that these NAAQS standards will be permanently relaxed absent Congressional action, these unconventional tactics may provide some near-term relief to entities looking to expand or develop in Wisconsin and nationally.

Ozone Redesignation—Southeastern Wisconsin

On January 16, 2025, EPA reclassified parts of southeastern Wisconsin from “moderate” to “serious” nonattainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. But that reclassification has been put on hold. On September 5, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stayed EPA’s reclassification of the region at the request of the State of Wisconsin, after EPA declined to take a position in response to the state’s request. While the Seventh Circuit considers the arguments presented, air permitting in southeastern Wisconsin’s nonattainment area will proceed under the prior, less stringent “moderate” nonattainment classification, providing some relief for expansion or building of major sources in the region for the time being.

Southeastern Wisconsin was in attainment with the ozone standards from 2012 until 2015, when EPA revised the ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 parts per billion. As a result, portions of southeastern Wisconsin were first classified as “marginal” nonattainment and then redesignated to “moderate” nonattainment in 2021. These areas include Milwaukee County, Ozaukee County, and parts of Washington, Waukesha, Racine, Sheboygan, and Kenosha Counties. Since the ozone monitors used for designation of the region have not yet met the 70 parts per billion standard, these areas were redesignated as “serious” nonattainment areas beginning in 2025, which affects (1) construction of major expansions and new facilities that emit significant amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and (2) current sources of VOCs and NOx greater than 50 tons per year.

In its challenge to EPA’s 2025 rulemaking before the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the State of Wisconsin requested that the Court stay this designation, alleging that EPA committed procedural error implementing the final rule and that EPA had failed to consider the impact of out-of-state sources of ozone precursors on the region. EPA declined to punch back—taking no position on the request and presenting no argument against the State’s request for a stay. In the absence of any opposition to the stay request, the stay was granted by the Seventh Circuit pending resolution of the State’s case.

Requested Vacatur of PM2.5 Standard

As noted in our earlier alert, on March 6, 2024, the EPA finalized a rule to lower the NAAQS for particulate matter 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) from 12.0 mg/m3 to 9.0 mg/m3. This higher standard would have resulted in more areas being designated as nonattainment for PM2.5, potentially triggering significant new costs and control requirements for facilities with air permits located in those new nonattainment areas.

A little over one year later, on March 12, 2025, EPA stated their intent to revisit the Biden-era rule. However, rather than introducing a new rulemaking to revise the rule, the EPA has instead urged the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to vacate the rule, despite EPA’s previous defense of the rule at oral argument a year ago. Going beyond the passive approach taken before the Seventh Circuit, EPA “now confesses error” to the reviewing D.C. Circuit and characterizes the revised PM2.5 rulemaking as “an unlawful tightening of the annual standard for fine particulate matter.”

Impact on New and Existing Facilities

With respect to ozone, until the State’s challenge to redesignation is resolved, air permitting will proceed under the prior “moderate” nonattainment standards. This means that, at least for the time being, parties looking to expand their operations or construct new facilities in southeast Wisconsin will have a lower regulatory threshold to navigate in order to obtain or modify their air permits, and existing facilities permitted under the “moderate” designation will not be required to reevaluate their air permitting status to account for the more stringent standards that EPA had finalized in January.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-12/epa%20website%20featruing%20environmental%20topics%20SMALLER%20FILE.jpg.webp?itok=ZyOF86Gx,N,,2025-12-16 19:00:22.868987

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.""

President Donald Trump's administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday's separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden's “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent -- to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

Ford will take a roughly $20 billion hit, but the company expects the recalibration of its electric vehicle strategy to prove more profitable in the long run.

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said the “customer-driven shift” will strengthen the company.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business,” Farley said in an announcement Monday.

Kelley Blue Book automotive expert Sean Tucker said the cancellation of the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup headlines the changes announced by Ford.

“They're cancelling a number of large EVs that they had planned, but they're not abandoning the EV market,” Tucker said.

Ford said it still expects about half of its global inventory will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030, up from 17% this year.

And the company has big plans for its universal EV platform, which will be used to roll out lower-priced, smaller cars and trucks, beginning with a midsize pickup in 2027.

Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV uses gas power to recharge the EV battery, but the gas doesn't directly power the vehicle's movement.

The engine is effectively a generator, not actually attached to the drivetrain in any way, Tucker said.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.

“All trucks lose about half the range when they tow, regardless of what their fuel source is,” Tucker said. “But that's a much bigger deal when stopping to recharge takes hours than it is when stopping to fill a tank takes two minutes.”

Plus, big trucks are most popular in the parts of the country where EV infrastructure is poor, Tucker said.

Ford said the next-generation extended-range EV, or EREV, F-150 Lightning will add an estimated 700-plus mile range and tow “like a locomotive.”

Tucker said Ford made the right call.

“It was an understandable decision in 2021 to say, ‘Our bestselling product is the F-150. Why don’t we just electrify our bestselling product first?’ But the market for electric full-size trucks is just, it hasn't really emerged,” Tucker said. “And I think that the EREV is probably a more realistic technology, that the sort of person who's interested in a full-size truck might listen to that more than they would to a pure EV.”

Tucker said KBB estimates that dealers have about a 147-day supply of fully electric F-150 Lightning trucks, so folks who want to buy one still have time.

Tucker said American automakers have a tough time balancing domestic and international markets, with about a quarter of the overseas market already electric. Stateside, it’s just 7% or so, Tucker said.

That creates a two-tiered, expensive production strategy, one for the North American market and one for the rest of the world.

Tucker said the U.S. market is still moving toward EVs, but it’s moving more slowly than initial projections.

And Tucker said Ford’s decisions have more to do with market demands than politics, with President Donald Trump trying to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements.

Despite significant opposition, the Environmental Protection Agency recently announced it would delay Biden-era methane compliance deadlines for at least 18 months.

Carlos Matutes, program director with the environmental advocacy group GreenLatinos, called the decision a ""horrific boondoggle"" for the extraction industry. He noted that New Mexico is the second-largest petroleum-producing state in the country after Texas – significantly affecting the state's frontline communities.

""We are the largest per-capita Latino population in the country,"" said Matutes, ""and then we have our federal government actively hamstringing our efforts to clean up our air for our most vulnerable communities.""

Exposure to methane can cause or worsen breathing problems, heart disease, cancer and strokes. GreenLatinos partnered with more than 100 other environmental groups and Tribal organizations to formally oppose the EPA's proposal to delay deadline compliance.

New Mexico has enacted some of the strongest methane rules in the nation, while neighboring Texas has almost no regulations, allowing unchecked pollution to drift across the border into the southeastern part of the state.

The 2024 updated rule would have required industry polluters to significantly reduce methane emissions and volatile organic compounds starting next year. A coalition of environmental groups told the EPA abandonment of the effort would not only affect public health, but also curb efforts to confront the climate crisis.

Matutes said the year-over-year increase in New Mexico's extreme heat events is likely to make things worse.

""We have the ability to literally save lives, cut tens of millions of tons of methane from being released into the atmosphere,"" said Matutes, ""including benzine, which is a known cancer-causing chemical.""

Because it makes financial sense, Matutes said some oil and gas companies have taken it upon themselves to reduce the release of methane, despite ever-changing regulations dating back to the Obama-era.

“Establishing an Office of Fusion at the Department of Energy is a critical step toward unlocking one of the most promising clean energy solutions,” said Representative Beyer.
“Fusion research and development is advancing toward commercialization, and we need a coordinated federal effort dedicated to getting fusion energy on the grid as quickly as possible.
The law streamlines the creation of clear federal regulations to support the development of commercial fusion facilities by codifying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s regulatory authority over commercial fusion energy systems.
This success proves the viability of fusion energy and the leadership of the United States in the face of heavy investment by China.","House Fusion Energy Caucus co-chairs Representatives Don Beyer (D-VA), Jay Obernolte (R-CA), and Lori Trahan (D-MA) today introduced bipartisan legislation to formally establish the Office of Fusion at the Department of Energy (DOE). Companion legislation was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) and John Cornyn (R-TX).

Last month, DOE released their reorganization plans which included an “Office of Fusion.” This bipartisan bill would codify this office, and urge DOE to move forward with plans to ensure that the United States can continue leading the way on fusion energy and eventually reach commercialization.

“Establishing an Office of Fusion at the Department of Energy is a critical step toward unlocking one of the most promising clean energy solutions,” said Representative Beyer. “Fusion research and development is advancing toward commercialization, and we need a coordinated federal effort dedicated to getting fusion energy on the grid as quickly as possible. An established Office of Fusion would provide the focused leadership and technical expertise necessary, in coordination with the private sector, to accelerate decades of scientific progress, give the United States the momentum it needs to lead the world in fusion energy development and deployment, and finally supply fusion power to the grid.”

“Fusion energy represents one of the most promising breakthroughs of our time, with the potential to deliver abundant, reliable, carbon-free power while strengthening America’s economic and national security,” said Representative Obernolte. “By reestablishing the Office of Fusion at the Department of Energy, this bill accelerates commercialization through public-private partnerships, positions our workforce and supply chains to compete and win against adversaries like China, and ensures the United States remains the global leader in fusion technology. Congress must provide clear direction and a coordinated federal strategy to move fusion from the lab to the grid, and this legislation does exactly that.”

“Fusion energy holds enormous promise to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable power while strengthening America’s competitiveness and security,” said Representative Trahan. “Formally establishing an Office of Fusion at the Department of Energy will give this rapidly advancing field the focus and coordination it needs to move from breakthrough science to real-world deployment. With world-class fusion companies and researchers here in Massachusetts and across the country, this bipartisan legislation helps ensure the United States leads the way in bringing fusion from the lab to the grid.”

With energy costs soaring across the nation, the office would advance fusion energy and accelerate research, development, demonstration, deployment, and market adoption of fusion technologies. In partnership with the private sector, this office would also advance near-term and long-term fusion energy science and technology to meet the growing energy, environmental, and economic demands of the United States.

“A clean energy future powered by fusion has the potential to bring nearly unlimited, dependable, and carbon-free electricity across our country, slashing energy costs for millions of Americans,” said Senator Padilla. “California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is leading the industry with repeatable fusion ignition breakthroughs, and Republicans and Democrats agree that now is the time to support further progress to cement the United States’ energy dominance and establish fusion’s market viability. Establishing the Office of Fusion is a bipartisan priority to support advancements in fusion technology to lower Americans’ electric bills and meet the evolving energy needs of our nation.”

“As energy demand continues to skyrocket, the United States must implement innovative solutions quickly to maintain reliability and safeguard national security,” said Senator Cornyn. “By establishing the Office of Fusion within the Department of Energy, this legislation would accelerate the deployment of cutting-edge fusion energy as an abundant and reliable power source to help meet surging demand and bolster grid stability.”

Last year, Trahan, Obernolte, Beyer, Padilla, and Cornyn’s Fusion Energy Act was signed into law as part of the Fire Grants and Safety Act. The law streamlines the creation of clear federal regulations to support the development of commercial fusion facilities by codifying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s regulatory authority over commercial fusion energy systems.

In December 2022, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory became the first lab to achieve fusion ignition — meaning more energy was released than was needed for the reaction. Ignition has been achieved at least seven times since then. This success proves the viability of fusion energy and the leadership of the United States in the face of heavy investment by China.

“The restoration of the Office of Fusion, first by the Trump Administration, and now Congress, is the newest powerful signal that fusion is rapidly evolving from its scientific origins to a commercial endeavor that will power the global economy for generations,” said Bob Mumgaard, CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems. “I applaud the sponsors of the bill for the vision and leadership in helping to ensure the Department of Energy’s fusion efforts are organized and, ultimately, funded around driving commercial deployment and scaling of fusion power.”

“A dedicated office of fusion at the Department of Energy was a priority for the FIA from the beginning. We thank the sponsors for their leadership on the introduction of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation and look forward to supporting its passage. This bill will codify the DOE’s plan to create an office of fusion. The prioritization of fusion through a dedicated office will advance the path to commercial deployment,” said Andrew Holland, CEO, Fusion Industry Association.

NRG Energy Investment Narrative Recap

To own NRG today, you need to believe it can balance its growing natural gas fleet with digital, distributed solutions while managing a high debt load. The Sunrun partnership appears additive, not transformative, to the near term story, where the key catalyst is still how effectively NRG monetizes rising power demand from data centers, and the main risk remains capital intensity and fossil fuel exposure from the LS Power acquisition and other gas investments.

The Sunrun deal fits alongside NRG’s broader push into virtual power plants and home energy services, but the US$12 billion LS Power acquisition is the more immediate swing factor for earnings, leverage, and investor sentiment. As NRG integrates those gas assets and layers on distributed offerings like this 1 GW virtual power plant, investors will be watching whether cash flows keep pace with interest costs and future decarbonization requirements.

A total of $171 million from the Australian and NSW Governments will be invested to establish the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry at Black Hill, Australia’s most significant solar manufacturing project to date. The project will be funded under the federal government’s $1 billion Solar Sunshot Program. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is providing $151 million in conditional funding and the NSW state government is investing up to $20 million towards this sunny venture.

The project is led by the Sunman Group and will deliver a 500 MW per year solar module manufacturing facility, producing up to 800,000 panels annually. For communities in the Hunter, this investment represents a major step forward in building new industries, diversifying the economy and supporting workers with long-term employment.

Creating local jobs and new skills

Construction of the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry is expected to generate around 200 jobs, with more than 100 ongoing positions once operational. These roles sit squarely in advanced solar manufacturing, an industry identified as a key opportunity for workers transitioning from coal, gas and legacy industries.

Sunman is working with TAFE NSW on an advanced manufacturing training program to build local capability in solar production, robotics, automation and precision engineering. A First Nations employment pathway and a scholarship program for students pursuing clean energy fields are also being developed. These programs are helping to ensure workers in the region are supported with available training for secure employment and clear career pathways.

As the Hunter transforms to a clean energy future, local councils, community groups and industry have consistently emphasised the need for secure jobs in net zero industries, and this initiative is demonstrating how the Hunter can prosper.

Building clean energy economies

The Hunter Valley Solar Foundry project signals a new phase in the Hunter’s energy resourcing. This initiative of the Sunman Group is founded by University of New South Wales alumnus Dr Zhengrong Shi, bringing his solar expertise back to local shores. Sunman already operates a 1 GW facility in China and a 500 MW plant is currently under construction in the United States, but Dr Shi has been clear about his ambition to return solar manufacturing to Australia.

The facility will produce both Sunman’s lightweight, polymer-based eArc modules and traditional glass modules, using local materials and suppliers where possible. It will also operate as a contract manufacturing hub for other solar companies, strengthening supply chains and boosting domestic capability.

Strengthening the Hunter’s long-term economic future

For the Hunter, the foundry is a practical example of how new industries can take root in regions built on traditional energy. The project leverages all the essential ingredients in scaling clean energy manufacturing:

existing industrial land

established workforces

transport links

the region’s engineering capability.

As global energy markets shift, projects like this are giving Hunter communities confidence the region can remain a major energy and industrial centre, with high-value jobs and new opportunities for decades to come.",https://www.netzero.gov.au/sites/default/files/NZEA_Logo_RGB_Favicon_S_32by32_0.png,N,,2025-12-16 21:58:57.501217

“Manitoba’s heavy vehicle and equipment manufacturers drive market leadership through ongoing innovation,” says Ron Vanderwees, President and CEO, Vehicle Technology Centre.
“Today’s announcement will allow our manufacturers to conduct industrial-scale advanced research on site at RRC Polytech in collaboration with academic researchers, suppliers and contractors.","Federal funding boosts applied research capacity in manufacturing and transportation

Today, Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) announced a $3.3-million investment that will expand applied research capacity at RRC Polytech’s Vehicle Technology & Energy Centre (VTEC), helping local manufacturers and businesses in sectors vital to Manitoba’s economy to address gaps in their ability to innovate on the path toward zero emissions.

“Building a stronger, more competitive Canadian economy means investing in the Prairies’ unique strengths,” said the Hon. Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada, in a news release.

“Our new government is helping Manitoba’s heavy equipment and vehicle sector innovate, adopt new technologies and create good jobs for workers and opportunities for local business. Together we are strengthening Canada’s clean industrial economy and ensuring we build Canada strong.”

The federal investment will help establish the Innovation Garage at RRC Polytech, in partnership with the Vehicle Technology Centre — a non-profit that works to accelerate Manitoba’s heavy equipment and vehicle (HEV) manufacturing cluster — the province, and private-sector partners. The funding is in addition to the $3.3-million investment made by the provincial government.

“This investment builds on the strength of Manitoba’s heavy equipment and vehicle sector, which exports around the world and supports thousands of good jobs right here at home,” said the Hon. Jamie Moses, Minister of Business, Mining, Trade and Job Creation, in a news release.

“By partnering with industry and RRC Polytech, we’re helping companies adopt new technologies, scale up and bring more made-in-Manitoba innovations to the global market.”

The Innovation Garage is a flexible project space that will enable academic researchers and industry partners to work together to advance research and development of processes and products that support the HEV sector and accelerate the province’s transition to a low carbon economy.

It will feature leading-edge equipment, tools and technology, including a microgrid lab focused on energy innovation and HEV infrastructure, and a hydrogen and fuel cell lab to advance clean propulsion systems and other new technologies.

“The Innovation Garage at RRC Polytech is about preparing Manitoba’s manufacturing sector for the challenges and opportunities of a changing world,” says Fred Meier, President and CEO, RRC Polytech.

“As industries transition to cleaner energy and work to address climate change, this investment provides the technology, expertise and collaborative space needed to innovate quickly and efficiently. Together, we’re building solutions that make our province more competitive and more sustainable for generations to come.”

The Innovation Garage strengthens RRC Polytech’s relationship with the Vehicle Technology Centre by increasing the institution’s support of and collaboration with Manitoba’s HEV manufacturing leaders. This will help small- and medium-sized enterprises adopt new technologies, strengthen workforce skills and bring more made-in-Canada innovations to market.

The project will also support the Vehicle Technology Centre’s Clean Technology and Advanced Manufacturing program, which helps manufacturers leverage their investments in industrial applied research and development.

“Manitoba’s heavy vehicle and equipment manufacturers drive market leadership through ongoing innovation,” says Ron Vanderwees, President and CEO, Vehicle Technology Centre.

“Today’s announcement will allow our manufacturers to conduct industrial-scale advanced research on site at RRC Polytech in collaboration with academic researchers, suppliers and contractors. Combined with the Clean Technology and Advanced Manufacturing program funding announced today, this investment will accelerate innovation in our regional cluster and build the research expertise needed for continued success.”

The Innovation Garage is an exciting evolution in RRC Polytech’s commitment to elevating industry and community through practical training and applied research. It’s an opportunity to collaborate with more of the province’s best and brightest to support digital transformation and develop more advanced and sustainable manufacturing processes and products that are critical to the adoption of cleaner tech.

The impacts are often cumulative. Groundbreaking projects like developing the world’s first electric tundra buggy with Noble Northern established RRC Polytech’s VTEC as a proven hub for innovation that specializes in the testing, validation and demonstration of emerging vehicle technologies and alternative energy systems.

Knowledge from that project was then applied to the creation of a diesel-to-electric conversion kit for school buses, which could be further adapted to help subsequent partners convert fire trucks, farm machinery and other heavy equipment to more efficient power sources.

The addition of the Innovation Garage will expand VTEC’s capacity to conduct technical exploration, increase commercialization and introduce a broader spectrum of technologies to assist more local companies to accelerate their clean technology transition while offering practical experience to students.",https://www.rrc.ca/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2025/12/RRC-PrairiesCan_Announcement-Dec_2025-3-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 19:00:02.129243

California has more than 201,000 public EV charging ports, compared with about 120,000 gasoline nozzles statewide, according to state data.
Together, they provide $179.8 million in federal funds to California to help build out its network of public fast EV chargers, Bonta said.
Those funds recently began flowing again after a federal court overturned the suspension after a lawsuit from California and other states.
Bonta said the state’s 50 lawsuits have protected $168 billion in federal funding that the current administration has tried to withhold from California.","California has filed its 50th lawsuit against the Trump administration this year — this time over the suspension of federal funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, state officials announced Tuesday.

The U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration allegedly have refused to approve any new funding for two grant programs created under President Biden, the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program, since this spring, according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington state. The programs were intended to build, repair and maintain electric vehicle chargers.

The U.S. EV charging network continues to expand. California has more than 201,000 public EV charging ports, compared with about 120,000 gasoline nozzles statewide, according to state data. But to address climate change, it needs more.

The complaint says the Trump administration’s actions violate the constitutional separation of powers because the funding was approved by bipartisan majorities in Congress. It asks the court to declare the administration’s actions unlawful and order it to resume processing the funds, which amount to about $3 billion.

“Bipartisan is not a word you hear a lot these days, but one that underscores this isn’t about party politics — it’s about the future of our country, our economy and our planet,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta told reporters Tuesday. “Trump is putting the brakes on projects that would reduce planet-warming pollution and smog, expand access to clean vehicles and create thousands of green jobs, and in doing so, he’s running over the co-equal branch of Congress that holds the purse strings in this country.”

Bonta led the suit with the attorneys general of Washington and Colorado, who were joined by a coalition of 13 other states and Washington, D.C.

The White House press office and the Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump in January directed all federal agencies to immediately stop disbursing funds from the two grant programs as part of his executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” which described such efforts as “burdensome and ideologically motivated” as well as costly to American consumers.

The five-year grant programs were created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by Congress in 2021. The Charging and Fueling program directed $2.5 billion to state and local governments for EV chargers and hydrogen fueling infrastructure while the Accelerator program awards grants to state and localities for the maintenance and repair of EV chargers.

Together, they provide $179.8 million in federal funds to California to help build out its network of public fast EV chargers, Bonta said.

That includes a $59.3-million award to the California Department of Transportation to build out a freight corridor for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles; $55.9 million to the California Energy Commission for zero-emission freight transportation along key freight corridors and major ports; and $63.1 million to Caltrans for the repair and replacement of broken EV chargers. A frequent complaint of EV drivers is that too often, early-generation chargers aren’t functioning.

The funds are distinct from those awarded by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program — a separate $5-billion initiative created under Biden to facilitate a national network of EV infrastructure across the U.S., which was also paused by the Trump administration this year. Those funds recently began flowing again after a federal court overturned the suspension after a lawsuit from California and other states.

The funds from Tuesday’s lawsuit are crucial to California’s EV adoption and climate goals, state officials said.

“California will defend the Constitution, our communities and the future we’re building,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. “With 2.4 million zero-emission vehicles on our roads and critical projects ready to move forward, we’re taking this to court.”

California is leading the nation in the adoption of zero-emission vehicles, with projections for at least 7.1 million plug-in passenger EVs on the road by 2030. The state was working toward a ban on the sale of all new gas-powered cars by 2035 before the Trump administration signed measures to block it. The state filed a lawsuit in return.

Trump also ended federal tax credits for electric vehicles. This month, the president announced a proposal to weaken fuel-economy and emissions standards that control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

Bonta said the state’s 50 lawsuits have protected $168 billion in federal funding that the current administration has tried to withhold from California.

Residents who want to apply for the rebate program can visit IndianaEnergySaver.com.
Bloomington recently launched its own program where volunteers help residents make energy upgrades.
Dorau said some residents can access additional funding for upgrades through their utility, credit union or the Indiana Energy Independence Fund.","Since it launched in May, only about 1,400 Indiana residents have completed applications to save money on things like water heaters and insulation.

These programs are new territory for states — and Indiana is actually ahead of many others.

Indiana is one of only five states that’s fully launched its rebate program with funding from the federal Inflation Reduction Act. Another seven states have made money for energy-efficient appliances available, but not whole-home retrofits.

Former state senator Jon Ford heads Indiana's Office of Energy Development. He said, for doing hardly any marketing, the agency is happy with the enrollment numbers and feels it's on track to award all the money within three years.

“This is a new program and we are — I don't want to say building it as we're driving it — but we are constantly looking at ways to improve this program as we move along,"" Ford said.

Ford said the OED has tentatively planned to start a larger marketing campaign early next year. The OED is also currently assessing more than 170 multi-family complexes, like apartments, for energy efficiency upgrades.

Ford said the state is looking for a way to help residents whose homes don't qualify for upgrades because they're currently unsafe due to issues like mold.

Getting everyone on the same page takes time, experts say

Getting rebate programs off the ground can be a challenge.

Therese Dorau is with Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute, which is working to educate Indiana cities about heat pumps — a more energy efficient alternative to furnace and air conditioner.

“We saw concerns about the upfront costs of paying for upgrades, but then we also saw concerns about the burden of enrolling in programs or proving household income,"" she said.

In fact, the OED said another 1,500 people have started applications for the home energy rebate program, but not finished them. Some enrollees are required to submit a year's worth of utility bills.

Emily McPherson is with the Center for Energy and Environment, which helped roll out a program for heat pumps in Minnesota. McPherson said implementing these programs well takes time. You have to make sure contractors can not only install heat pumps, but understand how it benefits their customers.

“The efficiency industry gets excited about a new technology, and you roll out a rebate and you make customers aware. Now that customer gets excited and they go to get a quote, they might get talked out of that particular technology,"" she said.

McPherson said we’ll likely see enrollment numbers grow as people become more familiar with the program.

Applying for the program could have benefits outside the rebates

Dorau said, even if you don't plan to take advantage of the rebates, it's smart for residents to go through processes like the Indiana Energy Saver application.

""It's always best to be able to plan ahead. Just like you would say, 'Okay, my car has 200,000 miles on it. I need to be saving up for a new car. I can start shopping. I can start looking at whether an electric vehicle would be right for me.' It's better to do that in advance of having an emergency situation where you need to make a big financial decision right away,"" she said.

Residents who want to apply for the rebate program can visit IndianaEnergySaver.com. Ford said the program can also assist people with their applications. Bloomington recently launched its own program where volunteers help residents make energy upgrades.

DOE’s investment will help Holtec deploy two SMR-300 advanced nuclear reactors at Palisades generating 600 megawatts of safe, reliable, clean energy in addition to the 800 megawatts already generated by the site. Holtec is taking an innovative approach to nuclear reactor deployment at every stage in the process, from setting up the reactors to selling the electricity they generate. The State of Michigan was proud to support Holtec’s successful application for the DOE’s Gen III+ SMR program.

Today’s investment builds on the announcement made last year to make Michigan the first state in the country to successfully reopen a shuttered nuclear power plant. The U.S. DOE finalized a $1.52 billion loan agreement with Holtec International to aid in the restart of the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant, and the USDA awarded over $1.3 billion to support the restoration of service at the plant and lower energy costs, including an over $650 million grant to Wolverine Power Cooperative to reduce the cost of power produced at Palisades.

Together, these investments will provide clean, reliable energy for 1.4 million homes, and protect 900 jobs, many of them filled by workers who have been at the plant for more than 20 years with approximately 45% of the workforce at the site being good-paying union labor upon restart.",https://michiganbusinessnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DOE-logo.png,N,,2025-12-16 19:00:07.081438

The lawsuit filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington is the latest legal battle that several states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump Administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.""

The Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Tuesday's separate lawsuit addresses the withholding of funding obligations for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million in Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator money.

Tuesday's lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania.

The Trump administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks that were put in place under Biden, in favor of policies that instead align with Trump's oil and gas industry agenda.

Once in office a second time, President Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden's “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, policies did not force American consumers to buy or automakers to sell electric vehicles.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV uptake, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix.

Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe rules and the gas mileage standards, cut the fines to automakers for not meeting those standards, and eliminated the EV credits.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent -- to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs transacted for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

Still, EVs are gaining traction in other areas around the world.

Who Benefits? - Governing Magazine,"TNS, www.governing.com",,,,,https://www.governing.com/infrastructure/new-yorkers-are-paying-for-a-massive-grid-rebuild-who-benefits,"National Grid and other utilities are spending billions of dollars to prep New York's electric grid for a generational shift.
""Transmission is the enabler,"" said Bart Franey, vice president of clean energy development for National Grid.
Several National Grid projects in the St. Lawrence County area and in Rotterdam will allow more affordable energy into Albany, Franey said.
National Grid customers started paying about $22 a month more in September after the Public Service Commission approved more than $5 billion in investments.
In July 2020, National Grid asked the Public Service Commission to raise electric rates and make upgrades to its system.","National Grid and other utilities are spending billions of dollars to prep New York's electric grid for a generational shift.

Renewable energy, manufacturing plants and AI data centers are popping up outside urban areas, often in regions with poor electrical infrastructure.

New York utilities are spending more than $4 billion to modernize the grid for those facilities. They are investments for which New Yorkers — many of whom are already struggling with utility costs — will have to pay for in the coming years.

""Transmission is the enabler,"" said Bart Franey, vice president of clean energy development for National Grid.

A renewable energy or a manufacturing facility can't just pop up and connect to the electric system. Transmission lines act as a freeway connecting the state's urban cores. Then there's the distribution system — the highway offramps — which send power from transmission lines to homes and businesses.

Because those transmission lines can only carry so much electricity, parts of the state become blocked off from investment.

""As demand for electricity grows, identifying sites with sufficient capacity is increasingly difficult,"" said James C. Johnson, executive director of the Steuben County Industrial Development Agency.

Improving those lines adds lanes to the energy highway.

The state is working to develop wind and solar resources as part of clean energy mandates laid out in the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.

It's most economically feasible to locate a solar farm on flat agricultural land. But agricultural communities don't generally have strong electric infrastructure, because they're not traditionally in areas with burgeoning economic development.

That can lead to numerous projects flooding a few communities where transmission infrastructure is limited, while making development impossible in swaths of the state where it's not.

""The transmission we have up there (in rural areas) was built a century ago, and it was there to serve rural communities that don't have a lot of economic growth,"" Franey said. ""Now, we're asking that same wire to export a lot of the renewables from those remote corners to loads across the entire state.""

In 2023, the Public Service Commission authorized utility companies to spend $4.3 billion on 62 transmission projects to allow renewable energy into more areas of the state. Because the development will, in theory, benefit all New Yorkers, the costs are paid for by everyone. The companies will start charging customers for the projects as they are completed.

By 2030, residential households that use average amounts of power will pay between $32 and $64 a year for those improvements.

Franey emphasizes the investments will not only help handle transmission of the renewable energy electricity but also improve an aging system. Power created in northern and western New York struggles to make it to Albany because of transmission constraints. Several National Grid projects in the St. Lawrence County area and in Rotterdam will allow more affordable energy into Albany, Franey said.

National Grid's Upstate Upgrade plan, which includes the renewable energy-driven investments, will construct or rebuild 1,000 miles of transmission lines and 45 substations.

The improvements ""will enable a lot more opportunity for manufacturing, for industrialization,"" said Michal Bartczak, one of the leaders of Avangrid's transmission development program.

""These projects have allowed us to respond to economic development opportunities that have been out of reach in the past,"" said Johnson, the economic development leader in Steuben County.

Much of western New York's existing infrastructure is at least 50 years old, Bartczak noted. An aging grid is not just a New York problem. About 30% of America's transmission lines are beyond their useful life, the Bank of America Institute found. Several circuit breakers being replaced at a National Grid substation in Rotterdam were from 1968, the Times Union observed on a recent tour of the facility.

""Replacing aging infrastructure is more cost-effective in the long term for our customers, which is why we are wisely investing in replacement and modernization to ensuring long life for our assets,"" said Patrick Stella, a National Grid spokesman.

Dozens of New York State Electric & Gas substations, which help manage and distribute electricity, are also not able to support the energy demands of future growth in those areas unless necessary upgrades — paid for by developers — are made. The Public Service Commission approved the transmission projects, in part, because increased clarity around grid access is expected to reduce the prices charged by renewable energy developers.

Much of the work being done in New York to handle the distribution of electricity from renewable energy sources has already been completed in states with more advanced solar and wind industries, including Texas, which has better infrastructure in place to handle the additional capacity on its grid.

In the early 2010s, Texas built thousands of miles of high-voltage transmission to connect renewable energy development in rural parts of the state to urban areas, the U.S. Department of Energy reported in 2023. Investment in New York was mostly limited to addressing reliability concerns during that period, not clearing the way for new power generation, the same study asserted.

Improving transmission is reasonable, but requiring that residents of Suffolk and Erie counties pay the same for the investment is not, said John Howard, who voted against the plan when he was formerly a member of the Public Service Commission. Costs should be allocated proportionately to those who benefit from the plan, Howard contends.

Utility companies were also given latitude to spend 50% more than the approved $4.3 billion if projects ran over budget, something to which Howard also objected.

""Tell me what other things anybody would buy that would do this. ... It just flies in the face of consumer sensibility,"" Howard said.

He also objected to the healthy profits utility companies will enjoy from the spending. Utility companies' high profit margins lead to higher rates, according to more than a dozen former utility regulators, company executives, economists and energy consultants who spoke to the Times Union in October.

All this investment is occurring on top of utility companies' requests for higher rates to fund other investments in the state's antiquated electric and gas system. National Grid customers started paying about $22 a month more in September after the Public Service Commission approved more than $5 billion in investments. Three other New York utilities are seeking electric rate increases.

""Let's not lose sight of the fact that we're underutilizing the grid that we've already built and already paid for,"" said Noah Ginsburg, executive director of the New York Solar Energy Industries Association.

Renewable energy projects can't come online unless the grid can fully support their capacity. As a result, developers spend millions to improve system reliability.

The state could adopt flexible interconnection, allowing grid operators to shut down a facility if it threatens to overload the system during peak hours. Developers shoulder the risk of losing out on revenue during certain parts of the day. Without needing to pay for costly upgrades, projects could be built faster and cheaper, Ginsburg asserted.

It's also questionable whether the right transmission projects were chosen. Between January and October this year, 180 wind, solar and other energy-intensive projects were cancelled, according to New York Independent System Operator data. That's less than at the same point last year, but far more cancellations than in 2023 and 2022.

Some of the cancellations can be attributed to changes in the grid connection process, said Marguerite Wells, executive director at the Alliance for Clean Energy New York. The state ""needs a new approach to determine which grid upgrades are necessary and how to pay for them"" to ensure investment is paid for equitably and successfully opens up new areas of the state for development, Wells added.

'Increasingly Impossible'

The effectiveness of the grid investments is being tested at a high-stakes moment for New Yorkers — an era when the cost of living remains very high for many residents and businesses.

In 2020 — when the world's attention was focused on the coronavirus pandemic — a vicious feedback loop grew in the energy industry. Over the past several years, a series of events has also contributed to a rise in energy costs.

Between 2005 and 2020, electricity demand remained flat in the United States. The cost of electricity even fell between 2015 and 2019 in New York, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

Those trends held in the early days of the pandemic, but the groundwork for runaway costs then started to build. In July 2020, National Grid asked the Public Service Commission to raise electric rates and make upgrades to its system.

Many projects weren't approved by the commission because there ""was a recognition that consumers were really struggling,"" said Ian Donaldson, a communications and policy manager at the Public Utility Law Project.

But the need for infrastructure improvements didn't go away, and many were deferred to National Grid's rate plan this year. Utility expenditures on infrastructure have risen steeply every year since 2020, according to a state Department of Public Service report.

Now, many New Yorkers are struggling more to pay utility bills than they were during the pandemic.

Residential and commercial customers had as much debt with National Grid in October as they did in October 2020, after adjusting for inflation. The company's electric rates outpaced inflation by about 17% during that time span.

And when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, it pushed up the cost of natural gas. Prices remain elevated as the war drags on and the United States exports more gas, leaving domestic supply strained.

Post-pandemic inflation and increased interest rates both slowed renewable energy development in New York and increased the projects' costs.

At the same time, strides in artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency led to the emergence of energy-intensive data centers across the state. Former President Joe Biden's administration invested in onshoring domestic manufacturing, which also necessitates large amounts of electricity. Micron alone may require the power output of a nuclear power plant for its chip fab facilities being built in upstate New York.

In the backdrop, there are shifts occurring in New York's Climate Act, which provides incentives for rooftop solar, renewable energy and the state's nuclear plants through fees on utility bills. National Grid customers pay about $10 a month for programs related to clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction mandates.

Another troubling trend: As energy becomes ever more central to both economic growth and household affordability, even seasoned observers are finding it harder to untangle the complex policies and market forces shaping the industry.

""It's increasingly impossible for the average mortal to understand what the hell is going on,"" said Howard, the former Public Service commissioner.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday's separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

The full-scale plant will include iron and ""other valuable critical minerals,"" officials said.
The rare elements in the waste tailings make up only a tiny amount of the entire volume of red mud, according to past company testing.
It wasn't immediately clear how ElementUSA would incorporate or otherwise deal with the rest of the reprocessed red mud once the sought-after minerals were extracted.","A Texas company will move forward with plans to build an $850 million plant to extract rare earth minerals from contaminated mining waste lying in hundreds of acres along the Mississippi River near Gramercy, state and company officials said.

Following four years of refinement, ElementUSA plans to build a demonstration plant near the Atlantic Alumina plant and have production underway by mid-2028 to extract minerals critical to the U.S. supply chain and military readiness, Louisiana Economic Development officials said. Details on the size of the demonstration plant and how many people will work there were not released.

The facility also presents a way to reduce the longstanding waste piles near Gramercy that have been a source of chronic dust complaints and, more recently, caustic liquid leaks into the Blind River and the swamps around it.

Leaks from the storage areas have recently triggered a lawsuit from an environmental group and state enforcement action that risks fines for Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco.

ElementUSA plans to extract ""gallium, scandium, iron and other critical minerals from more than 30 million tons"" of mining by-products.

The rare elements, particularly gallium and scandium, are used in semiconductors, aerospace alloys and communication technologies, according to mining industry estimates, and aren't produced in the United States.

In late November, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded ElementUSA a $29.9 million Defense Production Act grant to build the demonstration plant near Gramercy and do development work at the company's Critical Resource Accelerator in Cedar Park, Texas.

Gov. Jeff Landry said Louisiana is ""delivering on projects that turn"" President Donald Trump's vision of 'strengthening America's industrial base"" into a reality.

""This project advances essential mineral production in the United States and positions Louisiana’s workers and communities at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry,"" Landry said in a statement.

Full-scale plant

ElementUSA officials said the company had done a far smaller demonstration at LAlumina's red mud ponds in Burnside as a research project for iron extraction a few years ago, but this demonstration plant would be an actual production facility to produce gallium and scandium for a defense department contract.

The full-scale plant will include iron and ""other valuable critical minerals,"" officials said.

ElementUSA's business plan might be new for Louisiana but has been seen as an option as the United States seeks out new sources in a global competition with China for the rare minerals.

In an August paper published in Science magazine, Colorado School of Mines researchers analyzed federal data and concluded the nation ""could meet much of its demand for critical minerals by recovering materials currently discarded in mining waste,"" according to a Mining.com report.

For years, the Louisiana Environmental Action Network has been tracking waste piles in the river corridor left behind by Atalco and other processing plants, which are permitted to be taller that most buildings in the state.

Marylee Orr, director of the regional environmental group, said reuse would initially seem to be the best long-term solution to a difficult problem, but the details and enforcement matter.

""The idea of further processing waste to extract valuable constituents sounds positive,"" she said. ""As always, though, the reality of adequate regulation and enforcement looms large. As Atalco has shown, permits and regulations are only as good as the facility’s ability and willingness to follow the rules.""

State and company officials didn't say when a full plant would be built but said the overall project is expected to create 200 permanent direct jobs and 554 indirect jobs, not including temporary construction jobs.

'Solution' to waste problem

Known as ""red mud,"" the wastes are left from refining red bauxite ore into alumina, a white chemical that is a precursor to the critical industrial metal aluminum as well as other chemical products.

Stored in what are called ""ponds"" or ""lakes"" set off by levees, the red dirt is laced with heavy metals, like mercury and arsenic, and low-level radioactive isotopes that naturally occur in the ore mined in Jamaica and shipped to St. James Parish.

Those leftover constituents and other aspects of the dirt have made red mud difficult to reuse.

Ellis Sullivan, chief executive officer of ElementUSA, called his company's plans on Tuesday ""a solution"" to this longstanding problem.

""We will be recovering bauxite residue from Atalco storage impoundments and delivering it to a new off-site processing facility,"" he said in a statement. ""After a short demonstration phase, the bauxite residue will be permanently removed over time from the Atalco site and converted into value-added mineral products that are critical to U.S. national defense and industrial infrastructure.""

He added that once removal starts, the company will employ measures to control dust.

""During excavation and loading, we will implement robust dust-control measures, including moisture management, covered transport, and controlled handling procedures designed to prevent airborne emissions,"" Sullivan said.

Online records show ElementUSA has not filed for an air permit with the state Department of Environmental Quality, so it is not yet clear what kind of emissions the company expects.

""Enhancing the United States’ only alumina processing facility, providing roughly 40% of the country's alumina, is a critical investment in our nation’s future,"" he said.

The rare elements in the waste tailings make up only a tiny amount of the entire volume of red mud, according to past company testing. It wasn't immediately clear how ElementUSA would incorporate or otherwise deal with the rest of the reprocessed red mud once the sought-after minerals were extracted.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/d4/3d430b7d-6fdd-4e14-a4df-e39ccbb28496/68cc515e75044.image.jpg?crop=886%2C465%2C0%2C127,N,,2025-12-16 19:58:44.707535

“Her commitment to partnerships and science-based solutions has made the Mobile Bay program a national model.
Figures for our collaboration on the bipartisan ESTUARIES Act to reauthorize the National Estuary Program and continue investing in the health of our nation’s estuaries.” The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration.","WASHINGTON – The U.S. House of Representatives passed Congressman Shomari C. Figures (AL-02)’s bipartisan Enhancing Science, Treatment, and Upkeep of America’s Resilient and Important Estuarine Systems Act (ESTUARIES Act)(link is external), legislation to reauthorize the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Estuary Program (NEP) through 2031.

Figures is the first freshman Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to lead a standalone bill through committee and secure its passage by the full House.

“I am proud to lead this bipartisan effort to reauthorize a program that works and delivers real results for communities across the country,” said Congressman Figures. “The National Estuary Program supports locally led solutions that protect vital coastal ecosystems, strengthen water quality, and build resilience. Protecting and restoring Mobile Bay, which sits at the heart of my district, is essential not only to Alabama’s environment but to flood protection, our seafaring economy, and our region’s role in the national supply chain.”

The ESTUARIES Act reauthorizes the NEP for five years and adds the Mississippi Sound to the list of estuaries eligible for priority consideration. Since its creation in 1987, the NEP has protected critical habitats, improved water quality, and fostered regional resilience by empowering partnerships among the EPA, states, local governments, and community stakeholders.

“Mobile Bay is now home to the deepest port in the Gulf,” Congressman Figures continued. “Protecting the surrounding estuaries is critical not just to our local economy, but to our regional and national economy as well. This program succeeds because it puts local leaders in the driver’s seat and ensures federal dollars are used efficiently.”

The NEP currently supports 28 active estuary programs nationwide, spanning from Puget Sound in Washington and Santa Monica Bay in California to Mobile Bay in Alabama and Casco Bay in Maine. On average, local NEP programs leverage an additional $17 in non-federal funding for every $1 in federal investment.

Rep. Figures also recognized the leadership behind the program’s success in his district.

“I want to recognize Roberta Swann, who has led the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program since 2009 and will retire at the end of this year,” Congressman Figures said. “Her commitment to partnerships and science-based solutions has made the Mobile Bay program a national model. It is especially meaningful to advance this reauthorization in the same year she celebrates 16 years of leadership.”

The ESTUARIES Act is co-led by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Ranking Member Rick Larsen (D-WA-02) and Reps. Brian Mast (R-FL-21), Mike Haridopolos (R-FL-08), Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR-01), and Nick LaLota (R-NY-01), and is supported by a broad bipartisan coalition.

“Protecting and restoring Puget Sound, the nation’s largest estuary by water volume, is essential to Washington’s environment, culture and maritime economy,” said Ranking Member Larsen. “Thank you to Rep. Figures for our collaboration on the bipartisan ESTUARIES Act to reauthorize the National Estuary Program and continue investing in the health of our nation’s estuaries.”

Together the programs provide about $3 billion in funding nationwide, Bonta said.

In their lawsuit, the coalition of Democratic-led states contends the Department of Transportation has “quietly refused to approve” any new project funding under the programs since the spring of 2025, causing states to suspend charging station projects that were already in the works and to delay further building.

The Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.

The startup is backed by Jeff Bezos. The number came out in a Q&A with CEO Chris Barman, and put a fine point on how much demand has been building for the truck even as legacy players retool their EV truck strategies.

A Big Number With Caveats for Slate’s Reservations

Reservations aren’t sales, and refundable deposits in particular churn very heavily. Analysts at Cox Automotive and BloombergNEF have repeatedly warned that conversion rates will depend on pricing, financing availability and the pace of production ramps. Still, the fact that the gradient is steep and we are continuing to go up to 150,000 implies the Slate team is adding not just more recent hand-raisers but adding them faster than losing early sign-ups—early days, of course, but a positive signal in an industry reset.

In its Q&A, Barman promoted two concrete policy decisions that appeal to buyers seeking something for the money. Slate will not advance self-driving technology plans, sidestepping expensive hardware that can balloon sticker prices. And, yes, car seats can go in the optional rear seats — an unflashy but family-critical footnote that came up from many early adopters and one that underscores everyday utility over gadgetry.

Waning Demand for EV Trucks Challenges the Market

The milestone comes as electric pickups are facing headwinds. Ford has said it plans to phase out a fully electric F-150 Lightning and instead divert customers toward a generator-assisted vehicle after failing to reach volume levels that would earn money. Both Tesla’s Cybertruck and General Motors’ Silverado EV have been selling in limited numbers so far against their gas heritage, with S&P Global Mobility noting that pickup truck buyers remain “very sensitive” to price, how much range they give up when hauling cargo and whether there would be enough recharging stations near home.

Dealer data collected by Cox Automotive indicates robust EV inventory in bigger-size segments where weight, aerodynamics and the need to tow intersect with the cruel reality of battery cost and charging times. It is that environment in which Slate’s momentum is uncommon—and interesting.

Price and Packaging Are Slate’s Wedge in EV Trucks

Slate’s strategy is refreshingly straightforward: design an EV truck from the ground up to be cheap to produce, aim for a price tag in the mid-$20,000 range and eschew pricey bells and whistles.

By dodging the compromises of legacy platforms and focusing on lighter weight, simpler solutions, the company is attempting to crack the hardest code in EVs — cost.

Prices for batteries are falling, BloombergNEF reports, and if supply chains for manufacturing can be more localized the costs could shrink further. If Slate is able to qualify for important consumer tax credits while keeping options limited, the chances that reservation holders will convert are better—particularly those value hunters already stepping into their first EV.

Production Ambitions and Reality Checks in Indiana

At a refurbished factory in Warsaw, Indiana, Slate aspires to start with production of about 150,000 units annually — an ambitious goal for a new carmaker and at a level that would make it a substantial player in the compact and midsize pickup sectors.

Reaching that number requires a steady supply chain, prudent capital spending and quality manufacturing that satisfies pickup buyers’ expectations for longevity.

History offers cautionary tales. Like Lordstown and Canoo, both of which hyped significant reservations before stumbling on production, funding or go-to-market hurdles. Rivian’s ramp illustrates how even well-funded newcomers struggle with the steep learning curves around stamping, supply and service. The measuring stick of Slate’s performance will not be reservations, but throughput, quality, and cost control quarter by quarter.

What the Q&A Reveals About Target Customers

The most revealing queries from Slate’s audience were not around 0–60 times or autonomous highway features, but rather child-seat compatibility and practical options and real-world usability.

That’s in step with the wider demand shift tracked by S&P Global Mobility toward practical EV buyers that prioritize value, simplicity and reliability over top-end performance specs.

If Slate can make that practicality into a rugged, low-maintenance vehicle with predictable charging needs — and a service plan that gives peace of mind to first-time EV buyers — it could have enough space for a defensible niche while bigger brands recuperate.

The Metric That Matters Now: Deposits to Orders

If the company has crossed 150,000 reservations, that is a remarkable proof of interest. The next proof point is conversion: how many deposits turn into contracted orders once final pricing, financing and delivery windows are established. Keep an eye out for signs on final trims and option pricing, how many configurations meet the requirements of consumer incentives and if Slate can uphold build quality while scaling its Indiana plant.

At a time when major auto manufacturers are seeing retrenchment in their efforts to make electric pickups, Slate’s traction does stand out. If the company can translate this wave of reservations into steady production at a true mass-market price, it will have done what many incumbents and startups have floundered trying to do — make an EV truck pencil out for mainstream customers.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slate_ev_truck_edited_1765919057-1024x585.png,N,,2025-12-16 17:00:33.812148

****************************************************

National Taxpayers Union urges all representatives to vote “YES” on H.R. 3616, the Reliable Power Act authored by Rep. Balderson (R-OH). This legislation would require federal agencies to assess and mitigate the impact of any proposed regulations on the stability of the electric grid before those regulations are finalized to ensure the reliability of our systems.

Across the country, electricity demand is increasing at a pace not seen in decades. Data centers, advanced manufacturing, and population growth are placing unprecedented strain on an aging grid. To make matters worse, premature retirement of reliable generation sources, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear, have exacerbated the gap between supply and demand.

The accelerated decommissioning of generation from traditional fuel has occurred not due to market forces, but instead by state and federal policies that limit production, encourage investment in renewables, or increase environmental compliance costs. Worst of all was President Biden’s proposed greenhouse gas regulation known as Clean Power Plan 2.0, which would have had dangerous implications for grid networks. PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, even noted that the “Final Rule may work to drive premature retirement of coal units that provide essential reliability services and dissuade new gas resources from coming online.”

This legislation appropriately recognizes that a resilient grid requires a diverse and dependable generation mix. Rather than prioritizing one technology over another, the Reliable Power Act emphasizes outcomes—keeping the lights on and powering our economy from disruptions. Specifically, H.R. 3616 would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review federal agency actions so no final rule can move forward if it would cause a substantial negative impact on the adequacy of the bulk-power system. Equally important, the Reliable Power Act strengthens coordination between federal agencies, grid operators, and state regulators. Fragmented oversight and conflicting requirements have too often delayed critical investments or created uncertainty for those responsible for keeping the system running.

Far too often, federal agencies seek to institute rules that harm baseload power generation to reduce carbon emissions, but which ultimately raise costs on ratepayers or disconnect power plants from the grid. The Reliable Power Act finally breaks such a cycle and avoids future electricity rationing.

Roll call votes on this legislation will be included in NTU’s annual rating of Congress and “YES” votes will be considered the pro-taxpayer position.

Under South Carolina law, all energy users in the state are required to purchase electricity from their local utility.
It's a system that enables the largest energy users, which cause the most energy strain under the current system, to choose alternative energy sources.
For those who have concerns about this, limited retail choice does not signify complete deregulation of the state energy market.
Data centers will continue to be a hot-button issue this session, making commonsense conservative energy solutions such as limited retail choice even more crucial to consider.","From families to industries, everyone wants a piece of what the Palmetto State has to offer. As South Carolina continues to grow, we must identify sustainable energy solutions to mitigate an increasingly strained electricity supply while keeping rates affordable, especially as tech companies seek to bring more data centers to the state. This is exactly what limited retail choice has to offer.

Without a system such as limited retail choice in place, South Carolina will struggle to meet its mounting energy needs, and continued progress will be hindered by a lack of adequate energy infrastructure.

Under South Carolina law, all energy users in the state are required to purchase electricity from their local utility. This means only a small handful of companies are responsible for 100 percent of the state’s power in their assigned regions, and they are able to monopolize energy pricing as a result. Modernization requires us to embrace America First free-market policies and support healthy competition, particularly as advanced manufacturing and technology companies eye S.C. locations. By implementing limited retail choice and embracing President Donald Trump’s deregulation agenda, South Carolina will leave the current monopoly system where it belongs: in the past.

So what is limited retail choice? It's a system that enables the largest energy users, which cause the most energy strain under the current system, to choose alternative energy sources. This means industrial users would be able to purchase power from other states to make up for what South Carolina lacks in energy infrastructure, easing the burden for our power grid and our ratepayers.

This will raise South Carolina’s energy capacity instantly, without requiring costly construction projects on new power plants that take years to complete (if completed at all). For those who have concerns about this, limited retail choice does not signify complete deregulation of the state energy market. Rather, it strikes a balance between free-market competition and regulatory oversight. This will usher in competitive pricing while avoiding grid instability.

Limited retail choice is not a new concept. Nineteen states have already implemented limited retail choice, including Georgia, Texas and Virginia. A recent study conducted by Daymark Energy Advisors, which evaluated five states with such systems in place, estimated that this policy could save S.C. industrial energy users anywhere from $350,000 to $7 million annually depending on operational capacity.

It is also important to note that limited retail choice would not even be new to South Carolina. The natural gas market already operates under a limited retail choice system in which the state’s largest natural gas users are able to choose their supplier. Why shouldn’t South Carolina’s biggest energy users have a similar degree of autonomy with electricity?

Without limited retail choice, South Carolina ratepayers will be forced to pay the price for investment in our state through continued spikes in electricity prices to account for the significant energy capacity required by industrial users. Conversely, limited retail choice can empower South Carolinians through lower electricity rates and greater efficiency.

This will put more money in people’s pockets rather than generate higher energy costs for everyday ratepayers, allowing the benefits of economic growth to be felt statewide. By cultivating an energy market that is fair and free, South Carolina will open the door to energy diversification through policies such as ""behind the meter,"" which would permit industrial energy users to generate their own electricity through such innovative energy sources as nuclear and geothermal power.

As the upcoming legislative session approaches, now is the time for our policymakers to take action and prioritize commonsense energy policies that will promote responsible growth in our state.

Data centers will continue to be a hot-button issue this session, making commonsense conservative energy solutions such as limited retail choice even more crucial to consider.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/23/023bace9-21f4-4cbb-b4ef-5063cd4deaeb/5f1af3ec32d61.image.jpg?crop=1558%2C818%2C0%2C110&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-16 19:00:40.464166

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday’s separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

States like Virginia with the highest concentration of data centers could see average electricity prices increase by another 25 percent by 2030, senators noted.
But price increases aren’t limited to the states allegedly striking shady deals with tech companies and greenlighting data center projects, they said.
But it’s also a member of an industry lobbying group, the Data Center Coalition, that “has opposed state regulatory decisions requiring data center companies to pay a higher percentage of costs upfront,” senators wrote.
“To protect consumers, data centers must pay a greater share of the costs upfront for future energy usage and updates to the electrical grid provided specifically to accommodate data centers’ energy needs,” senators wrote.","Senators launched a probe Tuesday demanding that tech companies explain exactly how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills in communities where prices are already skyrocketing.

In letters to seven AI firms, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) cited a study estimating that “electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years” in “areas located near significant data center activity.”

Prices increase, senators noted, when utility companies build out extra infrastructure to meet data centers’ energy demands—which can amount to one customer suddenly consuming as much power as an entire city. They also increase when demand for local power outweighs supply. In some cases, residents are blindsided by higher bills, not even realizing a data center project was approved, because tech companies seem intent on dodging backlash and frequently do not allow terms of deals to be publicly disclosed.

AI firms “ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a ‘Fortune 100 company’ is planning an ‘industrial development’ seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,” senators wrote.

States like Virginia with the highest concentration of data centers could see average electricity prices increase by another 25 percent by 2030, senators noted. But price increases aren’t limited to the states allegedly striking shady deals with tech companies and greenlighting data center projects, they said. “Interconnected and interstate power grids can lead to a data center built in one state raising costs for residents of a neighboring state,” senators reported.

Under fire for supposedly only pretending to care about keeping neighbors’ costs low were Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Equinix, Digital Realty, and CoreWeave. Senators accused firms of paying “lip service,” claiming that they would do everything in their power to avoid increasing residential electricity costs, while actively lobbying to pass billions in costs on to their neighbors.

For example, Amazon publicly claimed it would “make sure” it would cover costs so they wouldn’t be passed on. But it’s also a member of an industry lobbying group, the Data Center Coalition, that “has opposed state regulatory decisions requiring data center companies to pay a higher percentage of costs upfront,” senators wrote. And Google made similar statements, despite having an executive who opposed a regulatory solution that would set data centers into their own “rate class”—and therefore responsible for grid improvement costs that could not be passed on to other customers—on the grounds that it was supposedly “discriminatory.”

“The current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying,” senators explained—where costs are shared across all users—”was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.”

Particularly problematic, senators emphasized, were reports that tech firms were getting discounts on energy costs as utility companies competed for their business, while prices went up for their neighbors.

Ars contacted all firms targeted by lawmakers. Four did not respond. Microsoft and Meta declined to comment. Digital Realty told Ars that it “looks forward to working with all elected officials to continue to invest in the digital infrastructure required to support America’s leadership in technology, which underpins modern life and creates high-paying jobs.”

Regulatory pressure likely to increase as bills go up

Senators are likely exploring whether to pass legislation that would help combat price increases that they say cause average Americans to struggle to keep the lights on. They’ve asked tech companies to respond to their biggest questions about data center projects by January 12, 2026.

Among their top questions, senators wanted to know about firms’ internal projections looking forward with data center projects. That includes sharing their projected energy use through 2030, as well as the “impact of your AI data centers on regional utility costs.” Companies are also expected to explain how “internal projections of data center energy consumption” justify any “opposition to the creation of a distinct data center rate class.”

Additionally, senators asked firms to outline steps they’ve taken to prevent passing on costs to neighbors and details of any impact studies companies have conducted.

Likely to raise the most eyebrows, however, would be answers to questions about “tax deductions or other financial incentives” tech firms have received from city and state governments. Those numbers would be interesting to compare with other information senators demanded that companies share, detailing how much they’ve spent on lobbying and advocacy for data centers. Senators appear keen to know how much tech companies are paying to avoid covering a proportionate amount of infrastructure costs.

“To protect consumers, data centers must pay a greater share of the costs upfront for future energy usage and updates to the electrical grid provided specifically to accommodate data centers’ energy needs,” senators wrote.

Requiring upfront payment is especially critical, senators noted, since some tech firms have abandoned data center projects, leaving local customers to bear the costs of infrastructure changes without utility companies ever generating any revenue. Communities must also consider that AI firms’ projected energy demand could severely dip if enterprise demand for AI falls short of expectations, AI capabilities “plateau” and trigger widespread indifference, AI companies shift strategies “away from scaling computer power,” or chip companies “find innovative ways to make AI more energy-efficient.”

“If data centers end up providing less business to the utility companies than anticipated, consumers could be left with massive electricity bills as utility companies recoup billions in new infrastructure costs, with nothing to show for it,” senators wrote.

Already Utah, Oregon, and Ohio have passed laws “creating a separate class of utility customer for data centers which includes basic financial safeguards such as upfront payments and longer contract length,” senators noted, and Virginia is notably weighing a similar law.

At least one study, The New York Times noted, suggested that data centers may have recently helped reduce electricity costs by spreading the costs of upgrades over more customers, but those outcomes varied by state and could not account for future AI demand.

“It remains unclear whether broader, sustained load growth will increase long-run average costs and prices,” Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers concluded. “In some cases, spikes in load growth can result in significant, near-term retail price increase.”

Until companies prove they’re paying their fair share, senators expect electricity bills to keep climbing, particularly in vulnerable areas. That will likely only increase pressure for regulators to intervene, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, Ari Peskoe, suggested in September.

“The utility business model is all about spreading costs of system expansion to everyone, because we all benefit from a reliable, robust electricity system,” Peskoe said. “But when it’s a single consumer that is using so much energy—basically that of an entire city—and when that new city happens to be owned by the wealthiest corporations in the world, I think it’s time to look at the fundamental assumptions of utility regulation and make sure that these facilities are really paying for all of the infrastructure costs to connect them to the system and to power them.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2249021916-1024x648.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 17:00:25.081751

Tuesday's separate lawsuit addresses the withholding of funding obligations for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million in Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator money.

Tuesday's lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania.

The Trump administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks that were put in place under Biden, in favor of policies that instead align with Trump's oil and gas industry agenda.

Once in office a second time, President Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden's “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, policies did not force American consumers to buy or automakers to sell electric vehicles.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent -- to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

Utilizing prefabricated modular skids from Miller Electric is key to scaling EVgo’s nationwide network.” Pat Eliason, Group President at Miller Electric Company, said:","EVgo announced that this year, it deployed more than 40% of its DC fast-charging stations using domestically manufactured prefabricated modular skids.

The company introduced prefabricated EV chargers in 2023 and installed the first public prefabricated site in early 2024. Given that EVgo installed several hundred new DC fast-charging stalls (see Q3 2025 report), 40% should represent a few hundred stalls and a double-digit number of stations.

The main advantage of the preassembled systems is a significant reduction in installation time and cost (on average, by 15%). Additionally, the quality and reliability of a prefabricated system are higher.

To offer prefabricated charging systems with 350-kW Delta Electronics chargers, EVgo teamed up with Miller Electric Company, an electrical contractor based in Jacksonville, Florida:

“Prefabrication ensures consistent, high-quality assembly in a controlled environment by assembling all charging equipment onto a single base frame made from American steel and aluminum at Miller Electric’s facility before shipment to the installation site. Since the partnership first launched in 2023, EVgo’s expanded work with Miller Electric has supported local job creation. Miller Electric has scaled capacity at its prefabrication facility and employs more than 1,400 people in the Jacksonville area. “

The prefabricated charging systems are modular. A single system can have up to 14 stalls (up to 7 dual-head chargers, we assume). Additionally, depending on the order, other elements may be added, such as Wi-Fi infrastructure, lighting, security cameras, and canopies.

As of today, EVgo prefabricated stations have been installed in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. The first sites are under development in North Carolina, Utah, and more.

Dennis Kish, President of EVgo, said:

“The prefabrication model is a win-win for EVgo because we can fast-track infrastructure deployment to meet charging demand and support workforce development in this growing industry. Utilizing prefabricated modular skids from Miller Electric is key to scaling EVgo’s nationwide network.”

“Sixteen years ago, Democrats passed Obamacare and fundamentally changed how health care is offered in the United States.
Democrats sold the bill by promising the American people that Obamacare would reduce health care costs, preserve plan choice, and lower premiums for the American people.
Policies in the Lowering Health Care Costs for All Americans Act would shine a light on nefarious practices perpetrated by these middlemen and lower drug costs for all Americans.
“The Lower Health Care Costs for All Americans Act would also finally appropriate funds for Cost Sharing Reductions.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, delivered the following opening statement at today’s Committee on Rules hearing on H.R. 6703, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act.

Chairman Guthrie’s opening statement as prepared for delivery:

“Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member McGovern for inviting me to testify today.

“Sixteen years ago, Democrats passed Obamacare and fundamentally changed how health care is offered in the United States. Democrats sold the bill by promising the American people that Obamacare would reduce health care costs, preserve plan choice, and lower premiums for the American people.

“However, here we are, a decade and a half later and it is obvious that the Democrats’ promises have not proven true. Health care spending has only increased, plan options have been depleted, and the American people are being crushed by the unaffordability of the one-size-fits-all, government-first approach Obamacare codified.

“Since its passage, health care premiums in the Obamacare marketplace have increased by 80 percent, deductibles are now on average $5,000, and the average out of pocket maximum sits at over $20,000. All the while, Obamacare policies redirected trillions in taxpayer dollars to big health insurance plans.

“Without a doubt, Obamacare has proven to be unaffordable.

“Seizing the opportunity of COVID-19, Democrats passed temporary ‘enhanced’ taxpayer-funded subsidies that go to big health insurance plans. These temporary COVID Credits were designed to mask the unaffordability of Obamacare, and they were passed not once, but twice, without a single Republican vote of support.

“Democrats have now argued that these additional subsidies should be permanent, but let’s not forget how we got here. It was Democrats that set up these credits to expire at the end of this year.

“When they were in charge, they chose not to make them permanent. If these subsidies are as essential as the rhetoric today would suggest, why would they choose to allow them to expire?

“In that same legislation, again passed with only Democrat votes, they chose to prioritize tax credits for the wealthy to buy electric vehicles and sent $27 billion dollars to Democrats’ politically connected friends through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction slush Fund (including $2 billion to a group that only had $100 in previous revenue), instead of making these enhanced tax credits permanent.

“Since the Democrats created these temporary COVID Credits we’ve seen an explosion of waste, fraud, and abuse that has exacerbated a major affordability crisis and hurt millions of Americans across the country.

“How have Democrats responded to this? By shifting the blame of their own failed policies onto Republicans, attempting to force legislation that would continue to send hundreds of billions straight to the coffers of big health insurance plans, and turning a blind eye to the growing evidence of widespread Obamacare fraud.

“They would rather put a Band-Aid on rising health care costs, masking their true impact on American families, rather than focus on policies to actually address the issue.

“The most frustrating part about this is that health care affordability is a real issue impacting all Americans, and in the past, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to pass policies that would have a real impact on lowering costs for everyone.

“Instead of working to pass policies that would implement real, lasting solutions to lower health care costs for all Americans, Democrats have chosen the partisan path in an attempt to turn their own Obamacare policy failures into political points.

“I am proud of the policies that Republicans have worked on as a part of the Lowering Health Care Costs for All Americans Act because they do exactly what the title of the bill says: advance real policies that lower costs for all Americans.

“The bill includes bipartisan policies that would finally take the first steps to hold drug industry middlemen, pharmacy benefit managers, accountable to their own customers: the American people. Policies in the Lowering Health Care Costs for All Americans Act would shine a light on nefarious practices perpetrated by these middlemen and lower drug costs for all Americans.

“The Lower Health Care Costs for All Americans Act would also finally appropriate funds for Cost Sharing Reductions. This policy would reduce ACA premiums by 11 percent – an even greater savings than extending the Democrats’ temporary COVID Credits. Funding CSRs has also enjoyed broad bipartisan support in the past, and it is a policy that was previously endorsed by my friends Ranking Member Pallone, Ranking Member Neal, and Ranking Member McGovern.

“I hope that we can work across the aisle to support this commonsense bill that would—without a doubt—increase health care affordability for all Americans.

“I also hope that, in 2026, Democrats will choose to rise above the politics and work with Republicans to advance real policy solutions that build on provisions included in the Lower Health Care Costs for All Americans Act to make health care even more affordable for the American people.”

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday’s separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

The Rehabilitation and Expansion of Bosaso Power Grid and Strengthening of Energy Sector Institutions project, funded through the African Development Fund ($9.62 million) and the Transition Support Facility ($13.74 million), will introduce new solar generation, expand the distribution network and install modern meters to help households manage energy use more efficiently. It will also bring solar home systems to families that have never before had access to electricity, including internally displaced people living in vulnerable conditions.

Somalia has one of the lowest electricity access rates in the world. About half of the population lives without power. Those who are connected pay extremely high prices as most electricity is produced with diesel generators, which are both expensive to run and highly polluting. Inadequate and unreliable electricity make daily life difficult and limit the growth of local businesses. Government agencies also struggle to manage the sector due to limited technical and financial capacity.

Bubacarr Sankareh, the Bank Group’s Lead Operations Advisor for Somalia, welcomed the approval, saying: “This project will change lives in Bosaso for families and small businesses. It will make electricity cheaper, cleaner and more reliable and is a major step toward a stronger and more resilient energy future for Somalia.”

These efforts are expected to reduce the cost of electricity for local residents and help businesses operate more reliably. Markets, small shops and service providers will benefit from steady and more affordable power. Families will experience better access to lighting, refrigeration and essential household services. Cleaner energy will also reduce pollution and improve living conditions in crowded neighbourhoods.

The project will also create new jobs during construction and long-term work opportunities in system operations and maintenance. It will also support public institutions through technical training and capacity building so that Somalia can better plan and regulate its energy sector.

This comes as Canada weighs its own electric vehicle future, and the U.S. recommits to gas cars — all while automakers struggle against Chinese EV dominance.
The under- and overtone of both letters was the elephant in the room: China, the clear global front-runner in electric vehicle production and sales.
""This is a global race to electric cars,"" Mathieu told CBC News from Brussels.
To ease tariff and trade pressures, Prime Minister Mark Carney paused Canada's electric vehicle sales targets, which also demanded all new Canadian car sales be electric by 2035.","The EU is scrapping its plan to ban all sales of new combustion-engine cars in a decade, following pressure from big automakers and some member states.

The European Commission, which proposes regulations for the 27-country bloc, announced some breathing room that effectively removes the previous hard target — where all new sales had to be zero-emission vehicles — and allows plug-in hybrids, hybrids and even combustion-engine vehicles to continue to be sold beyond 2035.

""In practice, 90 per cent of vehicles will be electric,"" said European climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra at a news conference in Strasbourg, France. ""For the remaining 10 per cent, we allow flexibility.""

The proposal, which still requires approval from member states and the European Parliament, says automakers can make up that 10 per cent through the use of sustainable renewable fuels or using lower-emissions steel made in Europe.

This is the second adjustment from the Commission for Europe’s auto sector, having already introduced flexibilities on how emissions would be counted earlier this year.

This comes as Canada weighs its own electric vehicle future, and the U.S. recommits to gas cars — all while automakers struggle against Chinese EV dominance.

While Hoekstra described this as a ""win-win"" for all, some critics see it as a distraction from an ambitious plan that would significantly lower Europe's emissions.

""The world is going electric and this will happen with or without Europe,"" said Lucien Mathieu, director of the cars program at Transport & Environment, a group of non-governmental organizations. ""What Europe risks doing — by clinging to the combustion engine and to the hybrids — is investing in these technologies that will be outdated.""

Ambition meets pragmatism

Other experts see today's move as a fair compromise, adjusting to current economic pressures for automakers.

""I think that the EU is taking a pragmatic approach,” said Joanna Kyriazis, director of policy and strategy at Clean Energy Canada. ""All countries with domestic auto sectors are revisiting their policy landscape to figure out what's possible, what's reasonable.""

""Hundred per cent is always a problematic goal,"" said Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at University of California, Davis. ""Banning gas cars, it may be great all the way to 90 and then very, very, very costly the last 10 per cent.”

The EV elephant

In the months leading up to Tuesday's proposed tweaks, there had been intense lobbying and pressure campaigns.

In a recent letter, six EU leaders called for allowing more fuel-efficient vehicles in order to ""pursue our climatic goal in an effective way, while not killing our competitiveness."" A counter argument, signed by a couple hundred members of Europe's electric vehicle industry, warned that diluting the goal would risk ""deeper dependency, lost influence, and falling irreversibly behind.""

The under- and overtone of both letters was the elephant in the room: China, the clear global front-runner in electric vehicle production and sales.

Kyriazis says Chinese-made EVs are low-cost, high quality challengers, but their dominance isn’t complete. While Europe has allowed them to be sold at a lower tariff rate than Canada and the U.S., they account for about 10 per cent of electric car sales.

""The fear has been that these EVs are just going to take over and kill domestic industry. And while they are popular vehicles among drivers, they haven't quite taken over,"" Kyriazis said.

But others see any slowing down from Europe as an open lane for China.

""This is a global race to electric cars,"" Mathieu told CBC News from Brussels. ""China is currently racing ahead, and Europe will not be able to catch up by investing in the technologies of yesterday.""

Turn signals

Today's proposed shif t isn't a compl ete reversal, unlike U.S. President Donald Trump's scrapping of EV mandates and tax credits as well as slashing fuel economy standards for gasoline vehicles. But experts say the climbdown will be watched around the world.

""It sends a message of mixed signals, a message of hesitation,"" Mathieu described, adding that the proposals serve as a compass for EV investment.

""We see today that it's hundreds of billions of euros invested in electric technology … all of those investments can be jeopardized if we change the targets while we're just starting or in the middle of this transition.""

To ease tariff and trade pressures, Prime Minister Mark Carney paused Canada's electric vehicle sales targets, which also demanded all new Canadian car sales be electric by 2035.

""Canada's at an inflection point right now,"" Kyriazis said, explaining that it can follow the U.S. example or adjust its plans slightly, as the EU is doing. ""I'm hoping … we take a similar approach of tweaking the policy to respond to this moment in time, while maintaining a clear market signal and commitment to electrification.""

And experts agree that whatever the road looks like to get there, getting off gas cars is worth the bumps along the way.

""Decarbonizing the light-duty vehicle sector is the closest thing to a silver bullet we have,"" Tal told CBC News.

""It's the one policy, the one technology that actually works, that can make a huge difference.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/092eff4d-9aae-43e6-bd2e-ad9f81e768e7,1765905686975/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%28859%2C1216%2C3468%2C1950%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-16 18:59:40.345382

At NSAC we are always guided by our members and the federal policy priorities we set together – this year those included strengthening the farm safety net, advancing climate resilience in food and agriculture, and building strong local and regional food systems that benefit farmers and families. We moved quickly and creatively to introduce bills in Congress designed to carry reforms and investments forward, we supported farmers and nonprofits navigating agency funding disruptions and terminations with guidance and peer support, and we organized our coalition to speak out in hundreds of channels nationwide – from social media to radio to local and national news – to elevate farmers’ and families’ stories about what was happening on the ground. This blog post reflects on that work, the progress made, the setbacks we faced, and the resolve that carried our coalition through a year marked by both instability and extraordinary collaboration.

Building Better Policies in Washington for the Farm Bill and Beyond

Congress failed to pass a full five-year farm bill again this year – leaving everyone who relies on this critical major legislation stuck for another year without an opportunity for real policy reforms or investments. NSAC and nearly 600 national, state, and local organizations delivered a joint letter to Senate and House leadership, as well as Agriculture Committee chairs and ranking members, urging Congress to advance not only an overdue farm bill but one that truly supports family farmers, strengthens rural communities, expands healthy food access, and more. The letter also called on Congress to correct harmful provisions enacted through the recently passed budget reconciliation bill.

We still saw some legislative wins this year: we helped draft, refine, and introduce nearly a dozen “marker bills” this year that together will build better farm and food policy in a future farm bill.

Farm Safety Net

Save Our Small (SOS) Farms Act – modernizes federal farm safety net programs to make crop insurance and disaster assistance more accessible for small, specialty, and beginning farmers, helping them stay on the land despite economic and climate challenges.

Crop Insurance for Future Farmers Act – makes crop insurance more affordable and accessible for new and veteran farmers by increasing the premium‑subsidy support and extending the time they’re eligible.

Farm Ownership Improvement Act – establishes a five‑year pilot program allowing farmers and ranchers to get pre‑qualified or pre‑approved for direct farm‑ownership loans to make it easier for new and beginning farmers to secure land.

Capital for Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act – creates a multi-year FSA loan pilot to help new farmers access flexible capital for startup costs, infrastructure, and management systems, addressing high barriers to entry and supporting the next generation of farmers.

Withstanding Extreme Agricultural Threats by Harvesting Economic Resilience (WEATHER) Act of 2025 – modifies the federal crop-insurance program to create a new type of coverage that pays farmers quickly and automatically when severe weather hits their area, giving them a simpler and more reliable safety net as extreme weather and natural disasters become more common.

Local and Regional Food Systems

Strengthening Local Food Security (SLFS) Act of 2025 – helps small and mid-sized farmers sell more locally grown foods to schools and community programs, boosting farmer income while giving families better access to healthy food.

Local Farmers Feeding Our Communities Act – helps small and mid-sized farmers sell more local food through state and tribal programs, creating stable markets for producers while improving access to fresh, nutritious food for families in need.

Strengthening Local Processing Act (SLPA) – standing challenges in the livestock and poultry supply chain. It advances a more resilient, competitive, and regionally rooted meat processing sector by updating the Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) program, increasing size eligibility, improving state cost shares, and requiring FSIS outreach. Together, these reforms would enable small and mid-sized processors to expand sales across state lines and strengthen regional food systems.

Climate Resilience

Agriculture Resilience Act – would adapt the farm bill to today’s realities by investing comprehensively across conservation, research, renewable energy, and rural development to help producers build resilience, boost profitability, and achieve net-zero agricultural emissions by 2040.

Strong Farms, Strong Futures Act – strengthens the Conservation Stewardship Program by creating region-specific climate mitigation practice bundles and higher cost-share incentives, giving producers more options and greater support to build complex and resilient conservation systems.

Support the WEST Act – strengthens key USDA conservation programs by boosting cost-share for water-saving and drought-resilient practices, expanding support for perennial systems, and enhancing soil-health outreach and testing to better serve producers in Western arid regions.

Organic Science and Research Investment (OSRI) Act – strengthens USDA’s organic research and data programs by boosting funding, coordination, and support for organic and transitioning farmers so that innovations in soil health, climate resilience, and sustainable production can benefit all producers and bolster rural economies.

Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act – strengthens USDA conservation programs to better support farmers adopting perennial and agroforestry systems, enhancing technical assistance, research capacity, and incentives to improve soil health, resilience, and long-term sustainability across US agriculture.

Converting Our Waste Sustainably (COWS) Act of 2025 – offers incentives for livestock and dairy farms to manage manure sustainably by funding practices and composting methods that cut greenhouse‑gas emissions and improve soil and water quality.

The government shutdown resolution package passed in November included a one-year extension of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 – the farm bill. This extension is largely “clean” – meaning without major changes to the 2018 bill – but it does have one problematic change that NSAC is fighting to remove in future bills: the bill removes key payment limits and income eligibility rules for EQIP and CSP, effectively enabling the largest operations to access unlimited conservation funding, shifting conservation resources away from smaller and mid-sized producers, and exacerbating existing trends where demand far exceeds available resources, shutting out access to these popular programs.

Protecting Federal Investments in Sustainable, Equitable Policy

This year’s federal budget process, shaped by a major reconciliation package and competing House and Senate spending proposals, set in motion decisions that will influence conservation, farm viability, and community resilience for years to come.

The spring and early summer centered on the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB), a major reconciliation package that folded remaining Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) conservation dollars into the permanent farm bill baseline, securing long-term funding but removing the climate guardrails that ensured those dollars supported climate friendly practices. OBBB shifted significant resources away from nutrition assistance programs and toward commodity programs, putting vulnerable communities at risk while abandoning programs that support the vast majority of farmers and rural communities. Overall OBBB represented a mixed outcome: a long-term win for conservation funding, but a failure to invest in long-term solutions that promote markets and invest in production systems that build all farmers’ autonomy and self-determination.

Appropriations debates intensified through the summer. The House advanced a $25.5 billion FY26 agriculture bill along party lines with major cuts to conservation, research, and local food systems programs, along with several harmful policy riders. The Senate, in contrast, passed a bipartisan $27 billion bill that largely preserved funding for core farmer- and community-serving programs. With no agreement in place by September 30, the government entered the shutdown that lasted from October 1 to November 12.

The FY2026 agriculture appropriations bill included in the shutdown resolution reflected continued funding cuts to several important USDA programs. While some programs maintained their current funding levels, others saw reductions, limiting USDA’s capacity to provide technical assistance, support innovative production, and strengthen local and regional food systems at a time when farmers need those services most.

Pressing USDA to Better Serve Farmers

With the start of the new Trump Administration came major shifts in USDA leadership and direction. Throughout the year, NSAC challenged the agency’s harmful program terminations, staffing cuts, and policy reversals, while lifting up farmer stories and working to advance our coalition’s priorities wherever possible. NSAC and partners worked extensively to secure funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for critical conservation and rural energy programs this year. Delays and cancellations in payments by the Trump Administration left tens of thousands of farmers and ranchers without funds that were already contractually committed by the federal government. Despite over $2.3 billion in signed contracts nationwide, these interruptions forced farmers to cover project costs out of pocket, threatening farm viability and undermining trust in federal programs. Across all of our campaign priorities, our coalition worked to ensure USDA hears from the producers most affected by its decisions and remains accountable to the communities it is meant to serve.

Proposed USDA reorganization: In July, USDA announced a reorganization proposal with little detail and no meaningful input from farmers. NSAC submitted extensive comments outlining how the plan could destabilize critical functions, from agricultural research to conservation programs to components of the farm safety net. We also mobilized farmers, advocates, and partner organizations to weigh in, despite USDA’s failure to follow the standard Federal Register comment process for a proposal of this scale.

USDA staffing crisis: This year revealed the depth of USDA’s ongoing staffing crisis. Through our multi-part blog series, we highlighted how the loss of more than 18,000 staff positions, and additional reductions expected under proposed restructuring, has already weakened the agency’s ability to deliver conservation assistance, research, technical support, and other essential services. By documenting impacts across key agency mission areas, especially at NRCS, we helped policymakers and the public understand the stakes and the urgent need for a transparent, farmer-informed process to rebuild USDA’s capacity.

With these agency-wide challenges in view, our campaigns worked on multiple fronts to hold USDA accountable and push to safeguard the programs farmers rely on.

Farm Safety Net

NSAC recently published a major analysis of the current farm crisis, highlighting rising production costs, collapsing crop prices, and unprecedented instability in federal programs. NSAC has continued to press USDA to take immediate action to restore program stability, provide revenue-based relief and loan protections, and strengthen the farm safety net so that farmers can weather this crisis and stay on their land.

In early December, USDA announced the Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) Program to address the economic impacts of tariffs and provide needed economic relief. NSAC, in partnership with the National Young Farmers Coalition, provided a swift analysis of the announcement and the limited program details that were released. NSAC highlighted the importance of FBA as a first step in providing economic assistance to farmers, but underscored the need for additional action to repair and expand the safety net to support all farmers.

2025 marked ten years since the first Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) crop insurance policies became available for producers. Since the introduction of this new risk management option in the 2014 Farm Bill, NSAC continues to advocate for improvements via legislation and regulatory changes at USDA that would make the product more accessible and functional for a broader set of producers.

USDA has continued to distribute disaster relief funding through the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program (SDRP) throughout this past year. Prior to the announcement of SDRP Stage 2 in late November, which specifically provides assistance for non-insured crop producers, NSAC provided guidance to Farm Service Agency (FSA) leadership on how to ensure accessibility to program funds for those producers. These recommendations included streamlined and reduced paperwork, clearer instructions in USDA documentation, and exemptions to the requirement for crop insurance enrollment among others. NSAC continues to provide support to our members as Stage 2 of SDRP applications remain open through April of 2026.

Local and Regional Food Systems

Early in the year, USDA abruptly paused and then later terminated the Local Food Purchase Agreement (LFPA) program, a nationally popular program with bipartisan support that helped farmers grow and sell produce into local schools, hospitals, and institutions. NSAC swung into action in partnership with National Farmers Union to deliver a letter with more than 1,000 signatures urging the program’s reinstatement. We helped over 100 farmers share their stories about why this program matters for their communities and businesses in press stories nationwide and raised the alarm on Capitol Hill, hosting briefings and meetings led by affected farmers, which led to bipartisan support for legislative solutions for the future of this program.

This year, NSAC focused on deepening stakeholder engagement around the FDA Food Traceability Rule, working closely with the Reagan-Udall Foundation to explore new possibilities for future food safety improvements and gather industry insights to inform more practical, effective implementation.

In October, USDA’s Beef Strategy Report offered modest wins for small and very small processors, such as reduced fees for overtime and holiday inspections. But limited funding in the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program underscored the need for continued advocacy to ensure these processors can access the resources they need.

Climate Resilience

At USDA, shifting priorities in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) and the Rural Development Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan programs created uncertainty for farmers seeking to adopt renewable energy. An August memo from USDA deprioritizing larger ground-mounted solar projects and raising questions about whether grants can be used to purchase solar technologies manufactured outside of the US, left producers with few clear answers, even as NSAC pressed USDA for needed guidance.

NSAC opposed EPA’s proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding, as removing the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases undermines climate protections. The proposal leaned on a discredited draft claiming climate change is “neutral or beneficial” for most agriculture, contradicting decades of research and farmers’ experience on the ground.

In September, NSAC worked for weeks both behind the scenes and in the press to persuade USDA to open its SARE funding pool, which helps farmers and researchers address sustainability and profitability concerns on farms. We helped coordinate a letter with more than 500 farmer signatories urging USDA to ensure the timely release of SARE funding. While we succeeded in seeing the RFA released, the delay until September 11 left host institutions little time to secure awards before the fiscal year ended, jeopardizing farmers’ access to regionally specific research.

Stronger Together

One of NSAC’s longtime coalition sayings reminds us that “No one knows everything. Together we know a lot.” Our coalition is at its strongest when we lean into our shared values and practice relationship-centered, collaborative advocacy. This felt especially true in a year as complex as 2025.

In February, nearly 100 member organizations and more than 30 farmers from 17 states gathered in Washington, DC for our winter meeting and lobby day, one of our largest to date. Meetings were held with roughly 150 lawmakers to share farmer stories and underscore the critical importance of federal agriculture programs. Despite funding freezes and political chaos, our coalition’s collective voice made it clear that Congress must ensure USDA fulfills its commitments. In August, NSAC coalition members from across the country attended our summer meeting in Stowe, Vermont, to ground ourselves in shared strategy – and of course visit amazing local farms and eat lots of maple creemees.

After many years of planning, NSAC completed a new 5-year strategic plan and has begun a new 2-year policy priority-setting process to be ready for 2026-2028 and beyond. Earlier this year, NSAC also developed an interactive time of our coalition’s history.

Looking Ahead to 2026

2025 presented steep challenges, requiring us to defend decades of hard-won progress while continuing to push forward. This year reinforced the importance of being resourceful and creative in a rapidly changing policy landscape – and we’ll keep it up next year too. Farmers, ranchers, and families nationwide all deserve a food and farm system that nourishes people, stewards our environment, and builds strong economies: we believe this is a future everyone can help create. Here’s a preview of what’s to come from us in 2026:

We will continue to campaign around the priorities our members and their thousands of farmer and community leaders bring to our shared table: reforming the farm safety net, bolstering resilient local and regional food systems, and fostering climate change resilience. We’ll bring these priorities to appropriations, to a potential new farm bill, to USDA, and everywhere in between here in DC.

We’ll gather in person together with our members and farmer leaders as always: in DC this winter and out in the field in August. This time together helps us build our strategies and strengthen our relationships as we learn from one another and advocate together.

Our analysis – always free and available to the public here on our blog – will continue. We will continue to highlight what’s happening in DC, what it means for farmers and eaters, and lift up ways for all of us to be heard on the issues that matter for food and farms.

Throughout 2026, we will continue mobilizing grassroots action, delivering timely analysis, and supporting our members and partners as we build momentum for a sustainable, resilient, and equitable farm and food future.",https://sustainableagriculture.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC04336-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 16:01:19.616889

The company shared the figure in a new Q&A video with CEO Chris Barman, where she answers questions from those reservation holders about the company’s plans for self-driving (there are none), or whether owners will be able to affix a car seat to the optional rear seats (they will).

Reservations are a somewhat helpful metric for gauging general interest in a new car, but they are by no means a signal of sure success. Time and again over the last few years, we have seen EV companies tout reservation figures only to go bust, either because they weren’t able to get through the difficult process of standing up production, or because they weren’t ready to have cars on the road.

For Slate, it’s promising that the number has continued to climb, meaning that new reservations are coming in faster than any attrition the company might be seeing. That said, Slate crossed the 100,000 reservation mark all the way back in May, right after it came out of stealth, so it took a good seven months to grow the list by 50%. And looking forward, Slate plans to make 150,000 of these EVs per year at the factory it’s refurbishing in Warsaw, Indiana, so it will need to attract far more buyers if it plans to succeed in the market.

Any continued enthusiasm for Slate’s EV has to be a reassuring sign for the company, given the state of electric trucks overall these days. Just yesterday, Ford announced it is ending production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the first major battery-powered pickup truck to hit the U.S. market a few years ago. (It’s being replaced by a version with a gas generator attached.) The company said the Lightning simply wasn’t making enough money — a fact exacerbated by how Ford was never able to sell more than a few thousand per quarter. Sales of other electric trucks, like Tesla’s Cybertruck and General Motors’ Silverado EV, have also struggled to stay above that mark.

Of course, the Lightning was a sort-of Frankenstein’s monster of a vehicle, with Ford shoehorning EV technology into a design that was originally meant for gas powertrains. Slate’s truck has been designed from the ground up to be an EV, and the company is hyper-focused on selling it for a price tag in the mid-$20,000 range. The decline of offerings from Ford and others may help clear the way for Slate to find early success — that is, until Ford’s real shot at a low-cost EV hits the market in 2027.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Blank-Slate-Profile_web.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-12-16 16:02:57.750189

The Final Regulations significantly modify some of the rules set forth in the formerly proposed regulations (the Proposed Regulations), which we discussed in a prior GT Alert. Consistent with our prior GT Alert on the Proposed Regulations, this GT Alert focuses on certain aspects of the Final Regulations that are relevant to special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).

Summary

The Final Regulations, which generally apply to stock repurchases occurring after Dec. 31, 2022, provide an exception for repurchases of certain types of stock issued before the Inflation Reduction Act's enactment. This exception may be available to SPACs that completed their initial public offerings prior to Aug. 16, 2022.

Because no similar exception was available under the Proposed Regulations, some SPACs may have filed excise tax returns and calculated their excise tax liability for prior tax years without the benefit of this exception. The preamble to the Final Regulations provides specific guidance for SPACs that would like to file a refund claim in these circumstances.

Exception for Certain Stock Issued Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act's Enactment

Although the Treasury Department and the IRS received numerous comments requesting exceptions from the excise tax for repurchases of mandatorily redeemable stock and stock that is subject to a unilateral put option, no such exceptions were included in the Proposed Regulations. The Final Regulations, however, provide an exception for repurchases of stock issued prior to Aug. 16, 2022 (i.e., the date of the Inflation Reduction Act's enactment), if, at the time such stock was issued and continuing until the time of the redemption, the stock was subject to (i) mandatory redemption by the corporation, or (ii) a unilateral put option by the holder.

The Final Regulations do not define the term ""unilateral put option."" However, the typical redemption rights of holders of SPAC stock may be viewed as substantially similar to a unilateral put option, and under that view this exception might be available to SPACs that completed their initial public offerings prior to Aug. 16, 2022.

Applicability Dates; Effect on Prior Tax Returns

The Final Regulations generally apply to stock repurchases occurring after Dec. 31, 2022. However, because the Proposed Regulations did not provide the exception described above, many SPACs may have filed excise tax returns and calculated their excise tax liability for prior tax years without the benefit of this exception.

If a SPAC previously filed a Form 7208, Excise Tax on Repurchase of Corporate Stock, applying the Proposed Regulations and wishes to file a refund claim after the effective date of the Final Regulations, the SPAC should consider filing a Form 720-X, Amended Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, for the quarter (or previously amended quarter, if applicable) in which the SPAC filed the original Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, and attach a corrected Form 7208 (with the word ""Amended"" added to the top of the corrected Form 7208). If a taxpayer other than the SPAC wishes to file a refund claim, the taxpayer should consider filing a claim on Form 8849, Claim for Refund of Excise Taxes, and attach Schedule 6, Other Claims, and a corrected Form 7208.

Conclusion

Given the new exception from the excise that was introduced in the Final Regulations, SPACs that completed their initial public offerings prior to Aug. 16, 2022, and that paid excise tax in prior taxable years should consult with their tax advisors regarding the possibility of filing a refund claim. Further, surviving companies from prior de-SPAC transactions should consult with their tax advisors to determine whether they are in a position to file a refund claim for excise taxes previously paid by a SPAC.

,EPA,2025-12-16 19:46:59+00:00,www.wbur.org,"After months of delay, EPA will give Mass. over $55 million for lead pipe replacement","Vivian La, Barbara Moran",,,,,https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/12/16/epa-massachusetts-lead-pipe-replacement,"Gulizia said that personnel paid through the program tested some 300 of Revere’s water lines for lead this year.
In its announcement, the EPA asserted there are far fewer lead service lines nationwide than previously estimated: about 4 million, down from 9 million.
Past estimates from industry experts and the EPA have ranged from 6 million to 10 million lead service lines.
In 2024, the EPA finalized a rule requiring drinking water systems nationwide to replace all water service lines containing lead by 2037.
“The delay and uncertainty with announcing the new allotments has forced us to pause our Lead Service Line Replacement Program and pause these much-needed projects,” said Gov.","Massachusetts will receive more than $55 million from the Environmental Protection Agency this year to help municipalities and other water providers find and replace lead service lines. The money comes after a monthslong delay, a complaint from the governor and a public spat between U.S. Sen. Ed Markey and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

""Although we're quite grateful for this tremendous amount of federal funding to do this critical work, having delay after delay makes it really hard to get this money out to communities,"" said Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bonnie Heiple.

Massachusetts has some of the oldest water infrastructure in the country, and many cities and towns have limited records pinpointing the locations of lead service lines. Checking the lines, which carry fresh water from the street into homes, is often time-intensive and expensive. So, many communities rely on EPA funding.

“Sometimes we just need to go out and physically dig something up and put eyes on it,” said Jorman Mota, assistant city engineer for the Chelsea Department of Public Works. “Can't really do that without the funding.”

Digging a small pit to test a line can cost between $2,500 and $3,000, said Mota. The city estimates that there could be up to 2,000 service lines left to check, or about 40% of Chelsea’s public water system. “It adds up pretty quickly,” Mota said.

The fate of another EPA program — the “Get the Lead Out” initiative — remains uncertain. The program provided technical assistance to approximately 200 communities nationwide, including six in Massachusetts, to help identify lead pipes and accelerate their replacement.

“It was a huge help,” said Anthony Gulizia, assistant superintendent for Revere's Water and Sewer Department. Gulizia said that personnel paid through the program tested some 300 of Revere’s water lines for lead this year.

“ Revere's a big city,” he said. “We have over a hundred miles of water main, and we only have a department of 12 guys.”

The EPA did not respond to a request for clarification about whether the program will continue.

In its announcement, the EPA asserted there are far fewer lead service lines nationwide than previously estimated: about 4 million, down from 9 million.

While some experts said this update could be “right-sizing” the data, others said it is likely a vast undercount.

“When EPA came up with this new number, it sort of blew the doors off of everyone,” said Erik Olson, senior strategic director for health at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. Past estimates from industry experts and the EPA have ranged from 6 million to 10 million lead service lines.

Olson worries that an undercount could result in some states getting less money in future rounds of funding. States that already have robust systems to track lead service lines could receive more money than states without good data, he said.

In a statement, the EPA attributed the reduction to “improved data.” However a new EPA inventory released in December noted that states that had not yet reported their lead service lines would have pipes listed as “non-lead.” Since certain state reporting is optional until November 2027, the data “may not reflect actual total non-lead service line counts,” according to the EPA website.

The possible undercount is unlikely to affect funding for Massachusetts; the state has made steady progress toward identifying and replacing lead water lines in recent decades, state officials said. Nearly all water providers in the state have submitted inventories of their service lines.

There is no safe level of lead exposure, according to the EPA. Lead is especially dangerous for pregnant women and young children, and lead poisoning can lead to learning disabilities and developmental delays. In drinking water, the primary source of lead is from pipes.

In 2024, the EPA finalized a rule requiring drinking water systems nationwide to replace all water service lines containing lead by 2037. That followed the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, which included $15 billion dedicated to lead service line remediation. The law mandated that the EPA distribute $3 billion to states each year for five years.

Since 2022, Massachusetts spent over $102 million in federal funds to support approximately 160 communities and public water systems to identify and replace lead service lines.

In addition, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), which provides water to 61 cities and towns around Boston, offers grants and zero-interest loans to member communities to replace lead service lines. The program is funded by water customers, rather than the federal or state governments.

Despite the progress, state environmental officials estimate that up to $359.4 million more than the funds already received will be needed to replace all the remaining lead service lines in Massachusetts.

“It's always been clear that the federal money is not going to fully pay for all the service lines to be replaced,” said Olson, of the NRDC. He said local and state investments, which have historically funded upgrades for water infrastructure, will need to ramp up.

Jennifer Pederson, executive director of the Massachusetts Water Works Association, an industry group, said replacing a service line on a resident's property can cost $3,000 to $8,000. And while some municipalities ask homeowners to pick up the tab, some water providers pay the full cost.

""Lead service line replacement is not cheap,” she said. “It's a significant investment.""

“Regardless of whether it's 9 million lead service lines or 4 million lead service lines, it's still far too many, and we still don't have the federal funding needed to replace all of them,” said Wendi Wilkes, who served as director of infrastructure implementation at the EPA's Office of Water during the Biden administration.

State and water system officials were expecting the latest installment of federal funding to arrive this past spring, so they could continue their efforts. When the money hadn’t arrived by fall, elected officials began to complain.

“The delay and uncertainty with announcing the new allotments has forced us to pause our Lead Service Line Replacement Program and pause these much-needed projects,” said Gov. Maura Healey in an Oct. 9 statement.

“The Trump Administration fails to understand the importance of supporting local projects to get lead out of our drinking water.”

In late November, Markey led the Massachusetts delegation in writing a letter to the EPA's Zeldin, urging the EPA to release the funds. The next day Zeldin posted on social media, mocking the senator and claiming that Massachusetts had not spent the money EPA had allotted to it for lead pipe removal since fiscal year 2023.

According to state documents, however, Massachusetts has awarded around $102 million in grants and loans on lead pipe remediation projects since 2022. There's $53 million remaining in federal funds that communities have yet to apply for, state officials said.

MassDEP Commissioner Heiple called Zeldin's claims ""patently untrue"" and dismissed his statement as ""all-caps name calling.""

""That's not the way we do business here,"" she said.

According to MassDEP, the state has never had to return lead service line funding to EPA, unlike other states that have failed to spend their funds.

Of the $55 million the EPA awarded Massachusetts this year, more than $21 million is re-allotments from other states that failed to spend their funds.

“I’m glad the EPA responded to my request to finally get this money out the door. I look forward to working with partners in Massachusetts to make sure we have the support, authorities, and resources our communities need to get lead out of the water and keep our children safe,” Markey said in an email.",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lead_Pipes_Funding_Errors_24297715923452-1000x667.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 16:01:27.267067

“More importantly, the very high end EVs, the 50, 60, 70, $80,000 vehicles, they just weren’t selling,” Farley told CNBC.
Farley had established Ford’s Model E division in 2022 to innovate on electric vehicles and operate as a startup within the more-than-100-year-old automaker.
At the same time, Farley told CNBC that he knew when he established Model E, it would be “brutal business-wise.” That may have been an understatement.
In under three years, the Model E division has lost $13 billion, more than double Ford’s net income for 2024.","Ford said this week it would cease production for the original electric F-150 Lightning, which was once touted as a breakthrough for the industry, and shift some of its existing workforce to producing a hybrid version of the pickup with a gas-powered generator called an EREV‚ or an extended range electric vehicle. The automaker said it would be taking a $19.5 billion charge in 2026 as a result of this “customer-driven shift.”

With that in mind, it’s worth reviewing what Farley said at the Ford Pro Accelerate summit in Detroit in September. EVs will remain a “vibrant industry” going forward, he said, but also “smaller, way smaller than we thought.” The end of the $7,500 consumer incentive would be a game-changer, Farley added, before predicting that EV sales in the U.S. could plummet from to 5% from a previous 10%-12%.

Speaking to CNBC on Monday about Ford’s electric pivot, Farley claimed the EV market had, in fact, already shrunk to around 5% of the U.S. vehicle market. The automaker’s EV lineup was simply out of sync with consumer demand, he said.

“More importantly, the very high end EVs, the 50, 60, 70, $80,000 vehicles, they just weren’t selling,” Farley told CNBC.

As part of its pivot, Farley said the company is listening to consumers.

“We’re following customers to where the market is, not where people thought it was going to be, but to where it is today,” he said.

This means prioritizing hybrid and semi-gas-powered EREVs over pure-play EVs. These categories are what customers are still interested in, Farley said.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1232994130-e1765911075888.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-12-16 15:00:28.640287

Glendale, CA – Glendale Water & Power’s (GWP) Intermountain Power Project (IPP) agreement has transitioned to a 100% coal-free energy resource, currently operating on natural gas while preparing for future hydrogen use.

The plant is located near Delta, Utah and operated under the supervision of Los Angeles Department of Water & Power. This major change lowers portfolio emissions, reduces long-term carbon-compliance costs, and better aligns Glendale with California’s decarbonization requirements, while strengthening reliability and supporting cleaner, more resilient energy utilization.

The City is focusing on a hydrogen-ready future, securing long-term access to a unit designed to gradually increase its blend of clean hydrogen. This positions Glendale to participate in the regional shift from natural gas to hydrogen as the technology becomes viable.

“For the first time, our power portfolio contains no coal-fueled energy resources, a significant milestone in our long-term commitment to sustainability and a cleaner energy future for our community. This achievement keeps us firmly aligned with the City Council’s goal of reaching 100% clean energy by 2035,” said Scott Mellon, General Manager of GWP.

The renewed IPP agreement offers a strong value proposition: it supports near-zero-carbon operations, helps Glendale meet future regulatory mandates, reduces dependence on buying carbon credits, and improves long-term cost stability by lowering exposure to carbon-related risks.

“Glendale’s transition to a 100% coal-free power supply marks a major step forward in our commitment to a cleaner, healthier, and more resilient future for our community. By establishing reliable hydrogen supply, we’re ensuring that Glendale remains at the forefront of innovation and reflects our dedication to delivering responsible, forward thinking energy solutions,” said Mayor Ara Najarian.

To reach this goal, GWP has completed extensive steps, including:

Early feasibility discussions on hydrogen conversion.

Reviewing engineering studies, timelines, and operational impacts.

Conducting internal modeling to ensure alignment with SB100 and future grid utilization.

Evaluating reliability impacts during the transition away from fossil fuels.

Working with partners to refine the agreement and clarify hydrogen-conversion responsibilities.

Providing ongoing updates to leadership to keep the city aligned with long-term clean energy goals.

In Q3 2025, over 5.3 GW of energy storage was installed nationwide. Third-quarter installations increased 31% year-over-year. Q2 2025 remains the record quarter for deployments, with deployments decreasing in Q3 by 6% quarter-over-quarter.

Through three quarters, the industry has exceeded the total deployment of the full year 2024, said the report.

“Strong growth in the U.S. energy storage market reflects a simple reality: meeting rising demand and keeping the grid reliable increasingly requires storage,” said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis, ACP.

The utility-scale segment was the primary driver of capacity totals, with 4.6 GW of the 5.3 GW total carried by this segment, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Texas and California represented 82% of total utility-scale storage deployment.

The residential energy storage market continues to make strides, installing 647 MW in Q3, marking the seventh consecutive growth quarter for the segment. Residential energy storage deployments grew 70% year-over-year in Q3. Wood Mackenzie projects Q4 2025 will set a record for the residential sector as customers accelerate installations ahead of the Section 25D tax credit expiration. The residential segment’s shift toward third-party ownership models, which accounted for 57% of the market in Q3 2025, is helping to mitigate the impact of the Section 25D expiration, said the report.

Community, commercial and industrial battery energy storage declined 8% year-on-year for Q3, installing 33 MW. California represented 54% of installations in this segment. Wood Mackenzie said Illinois and Massachusetts have emerged as key markets for the segment. California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) 3.0, and Illinois’ rebate programs are expected to sustain steady deployment through 2029, said the report.

Wood Mackenzie increased its five-year forecast for utility-scale storage deployments by 15% compared to its projections released in the first half of 2025. It said that the market may plateau or even decline in 2026 and 2027.

“Although domestic battery manufacturing continues to ramp up to meet new tariffs and non-foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirements for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Wood Mackenzie projects near-term supply chain adjustments and constraints will drive an 11% contraction in the US utility-scale storage market in 2026 and an 8% decline in 2027,” said the report.

However, Wood Mackenzie expects strong recovery, with double-digit year-over-year growth in 2028 and 2029 as U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity comes online.

The firm forecasts nearly 93 GW of storage deployment across the U.S. in the next five years.

“Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Air-cooled_commercial_and_industrial_energy_storage_system.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 15:00:42.064881

This has not been a typical year for science in America. Going beyond the headlines is important to understand what policymakers, scientists, and scientific institutions have built over generations. America is a scientific powerhouse, with federal funding fueling research breakthroughs that can maintain our global leadership. Congress plays an important role, whether by creating new federal science institutions, setting standards for scientific advancement, or allocating funding to science agencies. As a AAAS/ASGCT Congressional Policy Fellow in the House of Representatives, I witnessed much of this action up close.

How Congress Supports Science: Mechanisms for Funding and More

Congress has set the standards for scientific advancement through its constitutional power to promote science, including through Article I, Section 8 which grants it power “to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”. Congress influences these standards through allocating funding, writing and passing legislation, and establishing science funding agencies among other mechanisms.

The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering research and development (R&D), which includes developing a strong science and engineering workforce and enhancing American competitiveness in the global economy. Congress makes decisions that directly affect researchers through allocating funding to federal agencies and setting guidelines for its use, which we refer to as “policy for science.” The majority of R&D funding is concentrated in a subset of federal agencies driving American innovation and economic growth.

Congress determines the budget for federal science agencies including NIH, NSF, NASA and others, and writes legislation which establishes federal science and technology programs and agencies, thereby influencing the direction of U.S. scientific research. Additionally, Congress supports research infrastructure at national laboratories, which is required for cutting edge research to continue in these settings. Finally, Congress utilizes expertise and knowledge gained through science and technology to develop effective policies addressing critical challenges in our society.

The federal government is America’s top source of basic research support, providing 40 percent of total U.S. spending on research within its exploratory phases. Congressional investment in science and technology has fueled research findings that are vital for advancing medicine and health, in addition to building a strong and robust workforce. Funding for science has fluctuated across Presidential administrations, which can dramatically impact the research performed and types of training provided to the next generation. In the current administration, large amounts of grant funding at major science agencies including NIH and NSF have been terminated or frozen in several research areas. The NIH saw about $2.3 billion in unspent funds across nearly 2,500 grants frozen or terminated, while NSF had over 1,300 grants totaling about $700 million in unspent funds cut.

Congress may choose to act on revenue legislation pursuant to the proposals in the President’s budget, which may ultimately dictate R&D federal expenditures. As an example, the 109th the Congress included proposals to increase incentives for industrial R&D which passed in both chambers. In general, allocations for R&D spending by Congress are shaped by various political environments (e.g. a Republican-controlled House of Representatives may be less likely to support climate change research). They are also shaped via influential levers of power at any given time (e.g. Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee Hearing from the House Science, Space and Technology Committee on Assessing the Threat to U.S. Funded Research examined the current threat to the U.S. research enterprise posed by malign foreign actors).

One important recent law is the massive bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which provided for programs and policies in manufacturing and science, established AI and biotechnology standards, elevated federal R&D for basic and applied research, and supported training a strong STEM workforce. The legislation directs $280 billion over the next ten years, including $200 billion for scientific R&D and commercialization; some $52.7 billion for semiconductor manufacturing, R&D, and workforce development; $24 billion in tax credits for chip production; and $3 billion for programs aimed at leading-edge technology and wireless supply chains. At the two-year mark, during the Biden administration, several programs had been implemented showing advancements in semiconductor manufacturing, job creation, regional economic development, national security and innovation across the country.

A History of the U.S. Government Supporting Science

The partnership between the federal government and universities for the past 75 years has enabled much of this innovative research to take place in laboratories nationwide. Before World War II, science was rarely in effective contact with policymaking and the political process. The U.S. government played a relatively minor role in supporting American colleges and universities, which relied heavily on philanthropic endowments and private funding. This changed with Vannevar Bush, at the time Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, a federal agency formed in 1941 to mobilize science during the war. Bush’s 1945 text Science the Endless Frontier was commissioned by President Franklin Roosevelt, in response to his requests for recommendations on a national policy for science.

Bush’s proposals led to the creation of the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1950 (P.L. 81-507). To this day, NSF supports critical science discoveries moving this country forward. Additionally, World War II saw unprecedented levels of government support for scientific research, with federal dollars making up over 80 percent of all R&D spending in America by war’s end. Today, federal investments in research still provide a vital source of basic science support.

Congress also established the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) through the “National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976” (P.L. 94-282). OSTP’s goal was to provide the President with scientific and technological advice at the highest level of government. Today, the OSTP Director is the President’s main “science advisor” and co-chairs the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) among other functions. An interview by Arati Prabhakar, former Science and Technology Advisor to President Biden, highlights the Cancer Moonshot as an example, with the goal to halve the cancer death rate by 2047 and change the experience of those going through cancer. This is a concrete goal that can be acted upon via OSTP guidance on an important national issue for this country.

What We’ve Built: An American Scientific Powerhouse, Powered by Taxpayers

The U.S. is a global leader in science and innovation, supported by strong historic investments in basic science. These investments have helped garner our nation’s researchers the most Nobel prizes of any country. Additionally, U.S. scientists publish more research, receive more citations and earn more patents than any other nation, with significant contributions from immigrant inventors.

Private industry and philanthropy contribute important research support, particularly when funding cuts to science have been significant. However, these mechanisms can’t replace the steady support traditionally provided by the federal government for science that is essential for our global competitiveness. Incentives for research support and approaches to solving problems differ between federal government funding and philanthropy or industry, although there may be some overlap. Additionally, funding levels for scientific research in universities and non-profits through these sources are variable. In 2023, $58.6 billion came from the federal government, with $24.2 billion from philanthropy.

Where We Are Now: Challenges and Some Brights Spots

As a AAAS/ASGCT Congressional Policy Fellow with Rep. Bill Foster in the House of Representatives this past year, I witnessed and participated in congressional support of science up close, including through introducing bipartisan legislation focused on STEM immigration and the research pipeline. This work has been critical particularly given the Trump administration’s research funding cuts, and there is a strong need for Congress to act to restore funding. And while such legislation may not pass in the 119th Congress, its introduction can still help show congressional support for promoting American science and enabling the next generation of scientists to pursue research careers.

Although the U.S. has long been a leader in science and innovation, recent funding cuts have threatened this leadership and sent ripple effects through the scientific enterprise. Termination of funding has led to layoffs at federal agencies, impairing our nation’s ability to drive research forward, and negatively impacting research projects across our nation’s leading universities and national laboratories. The downstream effects of such cuts can lead to an entire generation of talent on the brink of being lost while other countries are attracting American scientists through support for research funding, relocation services, and access to state-of-the-art labs.

Despite federal research funding cuts, Congress continues to support scientific research on both sides of the aisle. In the legislative branch, funding for science has received bipartisan support for multiple federal agencies, including through the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, which funds NSF, NASA, NOAA and NIST. Congress has also stepped up to defend NIH in both the House and Senate.

Individual Members of Congress are working to support scientific research and the next generation of scientists through legislation, letters, speeches, and other activities. Examples of some of our bipartisan work in Foster’s office this past year include the Keep STEM Talent Act which would make certain advanced STEM degree holders eligible for permanent resident status. Another example is introducing the CRISIS Act, which would make certain vetted Russian nationals with advanced STEM degrees eligible for permanent resident status. While often these kinds of efforts can take multiple Congresses to gather sufficient bipartisan support and require the right political environment to advance and pass, they send a strong message that Congress is supporting science and scientists in this country.

Conclusion

Congress is essential to advancing U.S. research and innovation, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology on the global stage. Although the research enterprise is currently undergoing a challenging time, Congress continues to support scientific research on both sides of the aisle both in terms of funding, facilities, and STEM workforce development. Now is the time for those invested in the future of science to engage with their Members of Congress to ensure continued progress. As a scientist who has worked in Congress, I was consistently amazed at the hard work taking place behind the scenes to further science in America. This is not the time for experts to disengage; we need you.

The writedown was seen as the most visible sign to date of the auto industry’s pullback from a technology carmakers wholeheartedly embraced early this decade, exacerbated by President Donald Trump’s cancellation of electric-vehicle tax breaks.

Ford Motor’s shares rose 1.3% before the bell on Tuesday following the announcement. Tesla ‌edged 0.6% lower and General Motors was flat. U.S.-listed ‌shares of Stellantis were up about 1%.

Washington’s action has deepened the decline in sales, forcing the Detroit Three automakers – Ford, GM and Chrysler-parent Stellantis – to roll back their ambitious EV plans in the U.S. and pivot back ​to their hybrids and gasoline-powered vehicles.

“Ford’s strategic reset is a clear acknowledgement of shifting market realities and consumer demand,” Morgan Stanley analysts ‍said.

The charges are a “painful reset for the ​company” but one that is essential to align itself ​with consumer interests which would eventually improve profitability and returns for Ford, ‍Morgan Stanley said.

U.S. sales of EVs fell about 40% in November following the expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit on September 30. The incentive had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand.

Since September, Ford shares gained 14%, GM rose 34% and Tesla ‍advanced about 7%.

“This move by Ford was to be ‌expected (and should be expected for others) given a new reality on the dramatically weaker U.S. EV environment, driven by weaker demand and heavily reduced compliance requirements,” Barclays analysts said.

It is, however, a step in the right direction, and can help Ford improve profits, they added.

The ESRP is Austin Energy’s strategy to ensure the grid is more reliable and resilient against extreme weather and other disruptions, can recover quickly from outages and adapt to future challenges.

The ESRP includes a combination of hardening existing infrastructure, improving the grid to better accommodate Distributed Energy Resources (DER) like solar and batteries and continuing ongoing initiatives like vegetation management and upgrading equipment.

“Compared to statewide averages, Austin Energy's system is at least twice as reliable, but there's always room for improvement,” said General Manager Stuart Reilly. “Austin Energy’s resiliency efforts will go toward building an even more reliable electric system for our community.”

The utility’s data-driven efforts will target investments where they will make the biggest impact. The goal is to help as many people as quickly as possible, emphasizing vegetation management and wildfire mitigation.

Austin Energy’s ESRP priorities in 2026 include:

Expand the circuit hardening program to 10 circuits: Circuit hardening is upgrading existing overhead lines with more robust equipment (reclosers and fuses) and better technology to withstand damage and be more reliable.

Proactively replace 40 segments of underground cable.

Begin wildfire circuit hardening and apply it to 10 circuits in high wildfire risk areas.

Align vegetation management with risk & hardening efforts.

Inspect 8,000 poles.

Deploy 30 main line reclosers and 100 lateral reclosers in strategic locations: A recloser is an automatic switch on power lines that detects faults, briefly cuts power to clear temporary issues (like a branch falling) and then automatically recloses to restore power, significantly reducing outage time.

Conduct circuit optimization studies.

The utility’s initial budget forecast for the full 10-year implementation shows a $735 million investment in system improvements, including:

$340 for vegetation management and wildfire mitigation.

$280 million for circuit hardening, pole inspection, sectionalization and automation.

$115 million for intelligent systems, grid analytics and progress dashboard.

The approved FY26 budget allocates $60 million for ESRP-related utility expenses, including:

Long-term growth In the long term, Shangraw said he expects the inverter market to recover by the early 2030s.","China—the world’s leading solar PV market by volume and production—will see its inverter sector contract by 5% in 2025 to 304GW, a greater contraction than the global average. This is the first drop since 2019. The Chinese PV sector has been restructuring and changing course as it tries to end massive manufacturing overcapacity, sustained low prices and fierce competition between major players. This “policy uncertainty” will have ripple effects in the inverter space as well as in crystalline silicon solar manufacturing.

The rest of the Asia-Pacific market without China will expand its inverter market to 89GW in 2025, Woodmac said, supported by major investments in domestic manufacturing and emerging rooftop PV segments in India and Southeast Asia.

Europe and the US will both continue to experience decline and turbulence over the next two years. European inverter shipments face “sustained decline”, Woodmac forecasts, falling from 88GW to 83GW in 2025 and continuing to decline below 75GW annually by 2032. The forecast said this is down to “persisting inventory challenges and reduced utility-scale capture prices in key markets like Spain.”

European inverter manufacturers have faced challenges in recent years, as Chinese competitors have moved into the space with massive manufacturing capacities and low product prices.

Simultaneously, Europe’s solar market growth is set to fall for the first time in a decade this year, with 2025 levels only reached again in 2030, according to SolarPower Europe. This decline has been driven by faltering rooftop markets in many major European countries, which will hit inverter shipments particularly hard as smaller rooftop projects naturally deploy more inverters per megawatt installed.

The phaseout of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits for solar deployments will impact the US inverter market, Woodmac said, seeing the market decline by a significant 22% in 2026.

Beyond region-specific dynamics, the industry as a whole is seeing changes. Inverter prices are falling across the board, Woodmac said, driven primarily by Chinese manufacturing competition and technological advances. US prices are over 50% higher than the global average, “as market leaders Enphase and SolarEdge must compete against a growing number of Chinese vendors in Europe, Latin America, and APAC markets,” the Woodmac report said.

Cybersecurity for solar inverters

Cybersecurity is also becoming a major concern around solar inverters, as both the EU and US governments look to reduce their exposure to digital infrastructure outside of their direct control. Shangraw said stricter policies on cybersecurity are expected in 2026, which “could impact the competitive landscape between domestic and foreign manufacturers.”

US lawmakers have explicitly called for restrictions on Chinese inverters’ access to the market, while PV Tech reported today that the EU has included solar inverters as a “high-risk” product in its Economic Security Doctrine. These measures could increase the mix of domestically produced inverters in the two markets, or at least diversify from the few dominant firms in the sector. Europe in particular has installed almost 80% of its new inverters from Chinese companies, according to statistics from the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC).

“There is adequate existing local manufacturing supply or potential to ramp up to supply for the United States and the European markets,” Cormac Gilligan, associate director at S&P Global Energy, told PV Tech. Cybersecurity requirements would “at a minimum, increase utilisation rates of existing domestic manufacturing or potentially lead to expansion in manufacturing in the European Union markets and in the United States by non-Chinese manufacturers,” he added.

Long-term growth

In the long term, Shangraw said he expects the inverter market to recover by the early 2030s. “Electrification, AI demand growth and a cyclical repowering market will provide a solid foundation for inverter demand over the next decade,” he said.

“Companies that navigate the current challenges while investing in next-generation technologies will emerge stronger when the market recovers in the late 2020s.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lead-image.-Bill-Mead-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 17:59:20.620693

There are 74 million natural gas utility customers and roughly 161 million electric customers, resulting in an estimated $124 in higher natural gas costs for the average American family since January 2025.
Natural gas pipelines and regional power grid operators feature natural gas indices in their FERC-jurisdictional tariffs for various terms and conditions of service.
Many natural gas financial derivative contracts used in hedging and speculation settle against the natural gas price indices.
Federal law requires FERC to ensure that spot natural gas price indices feature adequate price discovery and market transparency.","Key Findings

Public Citizen’s analysis of federal data demonstrates that American households have paid $12 billion more for natural gas since Donald Trump took office in January than they paid a year earlier. The costs borne by residential consumers in the first nine months of 2025 are up 22% from the same period a year earlier.

The average American family has paid over $124 more on their utility bills in the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period a year earlier due to rising natural gas prices.

Record exports of natural gas—primarily in the form of Liquefied Natural Gas shipped from eight U.S. terminals—have played the largest role in this significant price burden for household consumers, as LNG exports are also up 22% over that same time. Combined demand from exports and gas-fired power generation for data centers is pushing natural gas prices higher, threatening consumers with higher fuel and electricity bills.

Impartial government energy analysts have found that LNG exports are causing higher natural gas prices for U.S. consumers. In 2026, prices will be 16% higher than this year “primarily due to increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.”[1] The U.S. Energy Information Administration says in its November 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook.

Twenty-five percent of S. domestic natural gas production is now exported (via pipeline and LNG)—up from just 5% a decade ago, according to federal data.

Natural gas consumption by eight LNG export terminals now exceeds the gas consumed by the more than 73 million U.S. households that are served by natural gas utilities.[2] The United States is the world’s largest natural gas exporter.

Trump’s Explicit Promise To Cut Americans’ Energy Bills In Half Contributed To His Electoral Victory

During the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly proclaimed that, if elected, he would slash Americans’ energy bills in half within 12 months.[3] Trump authored an Oct. 1, 2024 op-ed for Newsweek where he pledged: “We will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months—not just for businesses but for all Americans and their families.”[4]

In his Sept. 5, 2024 speech to the Economic Club of New York, Trump proclaimed, “My plan will cut energy prices in half or more than that within 12 months of taking office.”[5]

On Sept. 23, 2024, at a campaign rally in Indiana, Pa., Trump declared, “If you vote for me, I will cut your energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months. We’re going to cut them down in half.”[6]

At an Aug. 14, 2024 rally in Asheville, N.C., Trump proclaimed, “I’m announcing today that under my leadership, the United States will commit to the ambitious goal of slashing energy and electricity prices by half, at least half. We intend to slash prices by half within 12 months … We’re looking to cut them in half, and we think we’ll be able to do better. And every single thing that I promised, I produced, every single thing … So, we think your energy bills will be down by 50 to 70 percent. How good would that be for a thing called inflation? How — how good would that be? You know, energy is such a big topic, such a big cost.”[7]

On Sept. 29, 2024, in Erie, Pa., Trump boasted that “here’s a promise I’m making to you. I will cut your energy and electricity prices in half, 50% — 5-0 — within 12 months of taking the oath of our … Within 12 months, within 12 months of taking the oath of office, I will cut your energy prices by 50%, and it’s not going to be hard and I will terminate the natural gas export ban.”[8]

On Aug. 17, 2024, Trump proclaimed at a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., that “We’re going to get your energy prices down. We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%.”[9]

In a key post-election poll, Trump enjoyed a 39-point advantage over Harris among voters who said they supported him because of the level of price inflation.[10]

But as Americans’ utility bills continue to rise, Trump now claims that concerns about energy affordability are “a con job by the Democrats”; that polls showing voter concerns with affordability “are fake”;[11] that, as he said at a cabinet meeting, “The word ‘affordability’ is a Democrat scam”[12]; and that, as he announced at a Pennsylvania political event, affordability is a hoax.[13]

Americans Are Struggling With Energy Affordability

One in six Americans—21 million households—are behind on their energy bills. Forced disconnection from utility service because families cannot afford payments is climbing: 3 million in 2023, 3.5 million in 2024, and 4 million in 2025.[14] In addition, 37.4% of families earning less than $50,000 a year reported in a recent Census survey that they were unable to pay an energy bill at least once in the past 12 months.[15] The result is staggering household utility debt. The impact of high electricity prices can be seen in rising overdue bills. Since December 31, 2023, overdue household energy bills have risen by about 31%, from $17.5 billion to $23 billion by June 30, 2025.[16]

Americans’ utility bills are rising at twice the rate of inflation.[17] The nationwide average retail residential price for one kilowatt-hour of electricity rose from 16.82 cents to 18.07 cents between September 2024 and September 2025, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a gain of 7.4%.[18] The price of natural gas delivered to U.S. residential consumers has increased from $22.71 per thousand cubic feet in September 2024 to $24.66 in September 2025, an 8.1% increase.[19] At the same time, LNG exports increased from 363,030 million cubic feet in September 2024 to 451,755 million cubic feet in September 2025, a 22% increase.

Even registered Republican voters are increasingly blaming President Trump for the affordability crisis.[20]

Natural Gas Exports Are A Significant Contributing Factor To Residential Utility Price Increases

There are four broad variables impacting U.S. utility prices in recent months and into the near future, some of which Trump administration policies are making worse:

Higher domestic natural gas prices, driven primarily by record LNG exports.

Electric transmission and distribution costs, which include extreme weather and wildfire liabilities. These costs are administered by state or federal regulators and have been exacerbated by climate change.

Electricity demand load growth, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence data centers, along with transportation electrification.

President Trump’s unprecedented cancellation and revocation of billions of dollars of permitted renewable energy projects, combined with his unlawful abuse of emergency authorities to impose punitive tariffs, have injected chaos into domestic supply chains, stifling domestic investment in energy infrastructure.

Of these four factors, record natural gas exports not only represent the largest impact on natural gas prices, but feature clear statutory solutions to help protect consumers. The Natural Gas Act — passed by Congress during the Great Depression — asserts in Section 1 that “the business of transporting and selling natural gas for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest,”[21] with the U.S. Supreme Court affirming that the “primary aim” of this 87-year-old law is “to protect consumers against exploitation at the hands of natural gas companies.”[22] Section 3 of the law forbids exports of natural gas unless the Department of Energy determines the exports to non-Free Trade Agreement countries are “consistent with the public interest.”[23]

Trump explicitly promised voters he would slash energy bills by half within the first year, and Trump’s victory is attributed in part to that pledge. But electricity prices are rising at twice the rate of inflation, driven primarily by higher natural gas prices stemming from record LNG exports. And notably, Trump’s executive order on LNG exports — issued just hours after taking the oath of office — fails to prioritize protecting consumers from higher prices as part of the export public interest determination.[24]

While energy demand for artificial intelligence data centers has played a role in increasing electric rates for household consumers, an analysis by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory demonstrates that increased power loads from data centers can help lower electricity bills as long as revenue from their rates helps spread out the overall cost of operating the power grid among all electricity consumers.[25] That’s because many electric grid costs are fixed, and increased demand (even from data centers) can lower prices for other customers, including households. However, the study noted that this trend may not necessarily continue into the future if power demand continues to grow and if data centers cut sweetheart deals on lower rates, or fail to pay their share of interconnection costs.

Projections of spectacular future AI data center demand are highly speculative,[26] and even leaders within the AI development industry acknowledge that they are in the midst of a speculative investment bubble. Millions of GPUs housed in AI data centers gobble unfathomable quantities of electricity, with projections to add to the U.S. the existing power generation capacity of Japan in the next five years to accommodate data centers and other load growth.

This is absurd. Projections of load growth tethered to the speculative bubble have already forced utilities to backpedal on generation capacity commitments for data center projects that failed to materialize.[27]

Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) rental rate data suggest that the U.S. has already reached overcapacity for AI data centers, with prices for GPU rentals plunging from a year earlier. Banks are starting to more aggressively hedge against AI data center borrowing to protect themselves from a market crash.[28]

Electric power generation only represents about 7% of a data center’s operating cost. If natural gas ends up being the fastest way to boost generation, then doubling the cost of generation to 14% of operating costs to make sure the power comes online fast enough might make economic sense, As a result, data centers, unlike households, may be insensitive to gas price increases[29] and appear more likely to drive up the cost of natural gas for all customers, making it more expensive for residential consumers to heat their homes.

LNG is methane gas condensed into a liquid form by reducing its temperature to -260°F. This process is known as liquefaction. LNG occupies about 1/600th the volume of methane in its natural, vapor state, making it more economical to ship across oceans.

Liquefication occurs at specific terminals featuring large heat exchangers, which function as giant refrigerators. These heat exchangers are arranged at the facility in a connected series, called trains. The natural gas enters the heat exchangers and cools it to -260°F, thereby turning it into a liquid. This process involves the burning and release of a large number of pollutants.

The U.S. did not become an LNG exporter until 2016. Indeed, the first export terminals were originally designed as import facilities. Prior to the fracking boom, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan argued in 2003 that the U.S. had to expedite LNG import terminal permitting, and developers initially started building LNG import terminals before changing directions and building multi-billion-dollar export terminals.[30] Fracking was only able to expand on a large scale after Congress granted the process sweeping exemptions from compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.[31] Oil and gas lobbyists demanded immunity to head off federal litigation challenging the injection of contaminants in Alabama coalbed methane fracking operations.

There are eight active LNG export terminals, listed from the largest feedgas consumer to the smallest, by billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d)

Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana (with a 41% investment from Brookfield Asset Management) with 4.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in November 2025

Venture Global’s Plaquemines at 3.9 Bcf/d (although not technically in full commercial operation)

Cameron LNG (owned 33.2% by Mitsui, 27.6% by Sempra, 22.6% by KKR/ Canada Pension, and 16.6% by Total) with 2.2 Bcf/d

Cheniere Energy’s Corpus Christi with 2.1 Bcf/d

Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass at 1.7 Bcf/d;

Freeport LNG at 1.7 Bcf/d (with Jera and Osaka Gas as minority partners)

Kinder Morgan’s Southern LNG in Savannah, Georgia, and Berkshire Hathaway’s Cove Point in Maryland are splitting about 1.3 Bcf/d.

Two additional export terminals, Golden Pass – a joint venture between Exxon Mobil and Qatar Energy — and the Corpus Christi expansion, are also currently exporting prior to their formal designation of commercial operation. New facilities and capacity additions will double existing export capacity by 2029, exacerbating the current domestic price pressure families are facing.[32] Indeed, Plaquemines’ recent start “has redrawn natural gas flows and is already lifting prices east of Henry Hub as pipelines strain to keep pace.”[33] Henry Hub is the main U.S. natural gas benchmark price.

Public Citizen Analysis of Federal Data Shows Huge Natural Gas Price Increases Under Trump

American households pay natural gas prices for essential utility service in two ways. First, nearly 74 million American households[34] — or roughly 184 million people — have residential natural gas utility service. Second, natural gas supplies roughly 43% of the fuel for electricity in the United States, so natural gas prices are directly reflected in power bills in most U.S. states.

From January 2025 through September 2025 (the most recent month available from EIA), household consumers have paid $12 billion more for natural gas (both in natural gas and electric utility service) compared to the same period in 2024. This means that the average American family has paid $124 more for utility service since Trump took office due to rising natural gas prices. These higher prices are primarily caused by record LNG exports,[35] with the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s November 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook finding that higher natural gas prices are attributable to LNG exports, but they estimate that U.S. natural gas prices in 2026 will be “16% higher than in 2025, primarily due to increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.”[36] The EIA finds it is a long-term trend: because LNG export capacity is set to double by 2029, we expect this LNG export price hike on American families to become more severe over the next several years, a problem that is likely to be exacerbated by power demand from data centers.[37]

Our price impacts analysis relies upon U.S. Energy Information Administration data, measuring U.S. natural gas residential consumption, correlated with the average price of natural gas delivered to residential consumers, and comparing the period January-September 2024 to January-September 2025 shows that American households paid $6.7 billion more for natural gas utility service. We then linked natural gas volumes delivered for electric power correlated by the price paid by electric utilities for the gas, adjusting for the residential share of electric utility customers to estimate the natural gas cost share for household electric utility service to be $5.3 billion higher for the 2025 period compared to 2024. Adding the two means a $12 billion estimate for the higher natural gas costs paid by residential utility customers. There are 74 million natural gas utility customers and roughly 161 million electric customers, resulting in an estimated $124 in higher natural gas costs for the average American family since January 2025. Our calculations only assess direct natural gas costs paid by residential utility customers, which underestimates actual costs since Americans pay higher prices for other goods and services from higher natural gas costs borne by commercial and industrial customers.

Industry executives and analysts determine that record U.S. gas exports drive up domestic prices as the exports tighten the domestic market. Exporters, some owned by foreign companies, are buying domestic fracking operations to exploit the higher domestic prices their exports are causing (for example, Japan-based Jera’s $1.5 billion acquisition in the Haynesville shale).[38]

Wood Mackenzie found that U.S. gas price volatility has been on a clear upward trend over the past decade, mainly due to sharply increased LNG exports,[39] and has concluded that the combination of increased demand for both data centers and feedgas for LNG exports will require higher domestic natural gas prices.[40] “During the coldest days of winter, LNG exports and local consumers are competing for the same supply molecules. In extreme weather scenarios, there may not be enough gas supply to satisfy both,” Eric McGuire, a Wood Mackenzie energy analyst, told the Financial Times.[41]

Record LNG exports aren’t just raising prices for U.S. households, but expensive gas is making domestic coal more economic to dispatch, resulting in coal output increasing nearly 13% in the U.S. since Trump took office.[42]

Trump Actions Are Exacerbating America’s Affordability Crisis

Trump inherited America’s status as the world’s largest natural gas producer and exporter, but his actions have exacerbated the crisis. On Jan. 26, 2024, President Biden initiated a pause on pending LNG export applications to ensure the statutory public interest review “is committed to the affordability of energy and economic opportunities for all Americans.”[43] That’s because the macroeconomic analysis upon which DOE relied for its public interest assessments — developed and implemented in Trump’s first term — concluded that LNG exports at any volume will always be in the public interest because, even if households pay higher utility bills, the income shareholders earn from owning stock in LNG companies will exceed families’ higher energy price burden.[44] The Biden pause culminated with a December 2024 report that determined additional approvals of LNG exports threatened Americans with higher energy price burdens.[45] Further analysis by Resources for the Future found that price increases resulting from exports are likely to be twice as high as the Biden administration estimated. “Domestic gas prices could rise substantially more than DOE anticipates,” Resources for the Future wrote.[46] President Trump demonstrated his prioritization of LNG exporters at the expense of domestic energy affordability when he signed Executive Order 14154 within hours of taking the oath of office on January 20.[47] Section 8 of EO 14154 ordered the Secretary of Energy to “restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquefied natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible … In assessing the ‘‘Public Interest’’ to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application.” Notably absent from Trump’s order is any explicit requirement that the public interest review prioritize an impact on Americans’ energy affordability. The Trump administration announced that public interest reviews of LNG export applications would not include an environmental analysis as called for in the 2024 study, thereby expediting approvals.[48] DOE Secretary Chris Wright said in May that since President Trump took office, five LNG export authorizations have been issued, totaling 11.45 billion cubic feet per day.[49]

In approving Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG export application in August 2025, the Trump administration determined that increasing LNG exports would have only a “relatively modest” and “minimal” impact on domestic energy prices, and declined to perform an energy affordability analysis.[50]

In recent months, Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have acted as global gas salesmen, traveling to Europe to push exports and gut European methane regulations while attacking mainstream climate science. Over the summer, Trump announced a trade agreement calling for the European Union to triple energy imports from the U.S., buying $250 billion per year of fossil fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), an import target widely seen as dubious.

The head of commodities strategy at ING Bank told the Wall Street Journal that the trade deal numbers are “just not realistic. You’d essentially have to divert all energy trade. That’s just not possible.” In reality, Europe’s LNG imports have been declining due to the deployment of renewables and demand-reduction policies, a recent Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis report found. This goal of supplying $250 billion worth of fossil fuels to the EU each year would expose U.S. families to higher energy prices. Already, the flood of LNG into the global market in the last few years has driven up U.S. natural gas prices considerably, and consumer prices are likely to increase even further as Trump pushes for even more exports.

President Trump has endorsed the Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act, which would eliminate the public interest review for all gas exports, rendering the export of the commodity natural gas no longer subject to regulatory oversight.[51] Trump has explicitly framed his so-called energy abundance agenda to maximize fossil fuel exports rather than to address domestic energy affordability, as the President’s new National Security Strategy explicitly includes “Expanding our net energy exports” in its explanation of Energy Abundance.[52]

The Trump administration has prioritized LNG exports as part of trade negotiations on his punitive tariffs[53] — and in none of the announcements has his administration noted the impact increased LNG exports have on eroding domestic energy affordability. The Trump administration’s war on renewables threatens consumers with higher electric rates,[54] arbitrarily canceling or revoking permits for nearly $8 billion in domestic projects,[55] and leaving the nation vulnerable to energy shortages.[56]

In early December 2025, U.S. natural gas futures exceeded $5 per million British thermal units (Bcf), the highest price in more than three years, in part because of record feedgas flows to LNG export facilities,[57] as the U.S. became the first nation to export 10 million metric tonnes of LNG in a single month.[58] On Nov. 9, natural gas consumption by U.S. LNG export terminals—called feedgas volumes —exceeded 20 Bcf per day for the first time ever.[59]

The International Energy Agency reports that America’s surge in LNG export capacity will trigger more domestic price volatility for American consumers while potentially softening key global natural gas benchmarks. Which means that America’s consumers are subsidizing the world’s consumption of U.S. -produced gas, resulting in higher, more volatile prices here at home.[60]

More Gas Pipelines ≠ Lower Prices For Consumers

The natural gas industry and its supporters frequently claim that building more pipelines will always lead to lower prices for households. Indeed, President Trump claimed that if New York State approved two new natural gas pipelines, including the 400 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day Northeast Supply Enhancement, “you would have a $5,000 savings per family. All we need is a simple approval from New York.”[61] But an even larger 525 MMcf per day Leidy Southeast Expansion was completed by 2016[62] that linked Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale to New Jersey, yet natural gas prices in the region did not decline, but actually rose since the Leidy Expansion.[63]

While this industry-funded push to convince lawmakers and the public to expand natural gas pipeline capacity to serve domestic energy demand is the product of a shakedown by President Trump,[64] most proposed pipelines will simply lock in higher energy prices while delivering windfall profits for the hedge fund speculators that increasingly snap up pipeline capacity during open season bidding. In addition, the EIA reports that existing mid-Atlantic gas pipeline capacity is being used to fuel expanded LNG exports out of the Gulf Coast.[65] Indeed, nearly half of all recent gas pipeline expansion capacity was driven by the growing LNG export industry on the Gulf Coast. Instead of moving gas from areas of production to markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, flows instead shifted toward the Gulf to meet LNG demand for exports.[66]

Indeed, when Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy announced their merger in January 2024 to form Expand Energy, they boasted that their combined fracking assets in the PA-OH-WV Marcellus shale would optimize existing pipeline capacity to serve LNG exports from the Gulf Coast.[67] There has been $50 billion worth of new natural gas pipeline capacity in the United States mostly to serve expanded LNG exports.[68]

Most new gas storage capacity has been built in proximity to LNG export terminals to support export operations, rather than in regions to support gas-fired power generation or gas distribution utilities.[69]

Traders Controlled By China Have Reaped Hundreds of Millions In Windfall Profits Reselling US LNG Export Cargoes

The United States is unique in that it allows LNG export developers to utilize free-on-board structures that allow offtakers to move U.S. LNG cargoes to any third party willing to be the highest bidder. In contrast, most other LNG exporting nations rely more on rigid point-to-point contracts where the offtaker’s final destination is largely immovable.[70] This flexibility for U.S. LNG exporters has bestowed windfall profits for companies — including those controlled by the People’s Republic of China. Companies controlled by the Chinese government that hold offtake agreements with U.S. LNG exporters have earned hundreds of millions of dollars flipping U.S. cargoes of gas onto the global spot market.[71] Despite China’s profiteering, Trump’s Energy Secretary proclaimed that the U.S. seeks to sell more U.S. LNG to China.[72]

When arbitrators determined that LNG exporter Venture Global had improperly denied China’s Unipec access to its contractually obligated offtake agreement, Venture Global was forced to pay Unipec for the violation.[73]

While the U.S. under Trump prioritizes natural gas exports and actively seeks to undermine domestic renewable energy production, China now makes more money exporting clean energy than the U.S. earns from exporting fossil fuels.[74]

Under-regulated Gas Spot Markets Expose Consumers To Price-Gouging

For decades, wholesale natural gas prices were subject to strict price controls established and enforced by the federal government. But in a series of deregulatory initiatives, Congress ended price controls effective January 1993. While FERC regulates the rates that interstate natural gas pipelines can charge, once the gas exits that pipeline system into regional market hubs, prices are completely unregulated. States have no authority to oversee these pricing hubs, and FERC can only act if it finds evidence of market manipulation. A natural gas index price is derived from trades within specific geographical boundaries that market participants voluntarily report to a price index developer. Price index developers are private, for-profit companies that classify most of the voluntarily reported data as proprietary then commodify and sell the data only to those that can afford the very expensive subscription fees.

These voluntarily reported transactions determine the price of natural gas for millions of households and businesses across the country, as market participants reference index prices in their physical and financial transactions. Natural gas pipelines and regional power grid operators feature natural gas indices in their FERC-jurisdictional tariffs for various terms and conditions of service. State utility commissions rely on natural gas indices as benchmarks when setting rates. Many natural gas financial derivative contracts used in hedging and speculation settle against the natural gas price indices. Hundreds of billions of dollars of energy transactions rely upon voluntarily-reported price indexes — a 21st century version of a smoke-filled, price-fixing establishment.

Federal law requires FERC to ensure that spot natural gas price indices feature adequate price discovery and market transparency. Spot natural gas price indices are structurally non-competitive and the voluntary nature of reporting trades renders them susceptible to market manipulation. FERC should therefore establish an electronic information system, as authorized by 15 USC § 717t–2(a)(4), which states that “the Commission shall consider the degree of price transparency provided by existing price publishers and providers of trade processing services . . . The Commission may establish an electronic information system if it determines that existing price publications are not adequately providing price discovery or market transparency” [emphasis added]. Such “an electronic information system” could be based on actual transactions, and not limited to those voluntarily reported, and would be freely available to all interested parties through a platform hosted by the Commission, rather than the proprietary, commodified data model of the index publishers.

Indeed, FERC conceived of the idea of having authority to create its own electronic natural gas price reporting system. In testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on Feb. 10, 2005, FERC’s general counsel Cynthia A. Marlette included in her prepared testimony a section entitled Price Transparency in Natural Gas and Electric Markets, where she declared:

It would be helpful if the Congress clarified the Commission’s authority to require the development of an electronic price reporting system, and if the Congress gave the Commission the ability to require all electric market participants to participate in such a reporting system . . . and make it publicly available.[75]

Policy Recommendations

LNG Exports:

Enforce the Natural Gas Act’s mandate that exports can only be approved if they are found to be in the public interest, which would preclude any exports that increase domestic prices.

Revise DOE’s public interest review of LNG exports to include a distributional analysis of the impact higher natural gas prices have on households.

Limit Free-on-Board contract terms that allow financial traders to divert LNG cargoes to whatever party is willing to pay the highest price, rather than based on national interest destinations.

Restrict traders politically connected to the People’s Republic of China from holding offtake agreements with US export terminals.

Instruct DOE to limit or prohibit LNG exports during times of domestic shortages or price spikes.

Critics warn delays in going 100 per cent electric will let Chinese EVs pull ahead

The EU is scrapping its plan to ban all sales of new combustion-engine cars in a decade, following pressure from big automakers and some member states.

The European Commission, which proposes regulations for the 27-country bloc, announced some breathing room that effectively removes the previous hard target — where all new sales had to be zero-emission vehicles — and allows plug-in hybrids, hybrids and even combustion-engine vehicles to continue to be sold beyond 2035.

""In practice, 90 per cent of vehicles will be electric,"" said European climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra at a news conference in Strasbourg, France. ""For the remaining 10 per cent, we allow flexibility.""

The proposal, which still requires approval from member states and the European Parliament, says automakers can make up that 10 per cent through the use of sustainable renewable fuels or using lower-emissions steel made in Europe.

This comes as Canada weighs its own electric vehicle future, and the U.S. recommits to gas cars — all while automakers struggle against Chinese EV dominance.

While Hoekstra described this as a ""win-win"" for all, some critics see it as a distraction from an ambitious plan that would significantly lower Europe's emissions.

""The world is going electric and this will happen with or without Europe,"" said Lucien Mathieu, director of the cars program at Transport & Environment, a group of non-governmental organizations. ""What Europe risks doing — by clinging to the combustion engine and to the hybrids — is investing in these technologies that will be outdated.""

Ambition meets pragmatism

Other experts see today's move as a fair compromise, adjusting to current economic pressures for automakers.

""I think that the EU is taking a pragmatic approach,” said Joanna Kyriazis, director of policy and strategy at Clean Energy Canada. ""All countries with domestic auto sectors are revisiting their policy landscape to figure out what's possible, what's reasonable.""

""Hundred per cent is always a problematic goal,"" said Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at University of California, Davis. ""Banning gas cars, it may be great all the way to 90 and then very, very, very costly the last 10 per cent.”

The EV elephant

In the months leading up to Tuesday's proposed tweaks, there had been intense lobbying and pressure campaigns.

The under- and overtone of both letters was the elephant in the room: China, the clear global front-runner in electric vehicle production and sales.

Kyriazis says Chinese-made EVs are low-cost, high quality challengers, but their dominance isn’t complete. While Europe has allowed them to be sold at a lower tariff rate than Canada and the U.S., they account for about 10 per cent of electric car sales.

""The fear has been that these EVs are just going to take over and kill domestic industry. And while they are popular vehicles among drivers, they haven't quite taken over,"" Kyriazis said.

But others see any slowing down from Europe as an open lane for China.

""This is a global race to electric cars,"" Mathieu told CBC News from Brussels. ""China is currently racing ahead, and Europe will not be able to catch up by investing in the technologies of yesterday.""

Turn signals

""It sends a message of mixed signals, a message of hesitation,"" Mathieu described, adding that the proposals serve as a compass for EV investment.

""We see today that it's hundreds of billions of euros invested in electric technology … all of those investments can be jeopardized if we change the targets while we're just starting or in the middle of this transition.""

To ease tariff and trade pressures, Prime Minister Mark Carney paused Canada's electric vehicle sales targets, which also demanded all new Canadian car sales be electric by 2035.

""Canada's at an inflection point right now,"" Kyriazis said, explaining that it can follow the U.S. example or adjust its plans slightly, as the EU is doing. ""I'm hoping … we take a similar approach of tweaking the policy to respond to this moment in time, while maintaining a clear market signal and commitment to electrification.""

And experts agree that whatever the road looks like to get there, getting off gas cars is worth the bumps along the way.

""Decarbonizing the light-duty vehicle sector is the closest thing to a silver bullet we have,"" Tal told CBC News.

""It's the one policy, the one technology that actually works, that can make a huge difference.""",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-16 17:59:04.988077

THE LIGHT BETWEEN APPLE TREES: Rediscovering the Wild Through a Beloved American Fruit. Priyanka Kumar. 256 pp. Island Press, 2025. $32.

In her new book The Light Between Apple Trees: Rediscovering the Wild Through a Beloved American Fruit, Priyanka Kumar seeks to explore how apples might be able to better connect us to the wild and give us another viewpoint into ecological problems such as threats to biodiversity and climate change. She takes the reader on a tour through various histories of apple trees and different varieties of apples, and she introduces us to a diverse array of people whose lives and family legacies are intertwined with these fruits.

Kumar’s own connection to apples started with a childhood visit to an apple orchard in the foothills of the Himalayas and continues through to the present, at her current home in New Mexico. Kumar is a naturalist who studies ecosystems and biodiversity, and she realized how abstract and remote many ecological problems feel when one doesn’t have access to areas of wilderness such as large forests. What is more accessible to many people are areas of “micro-wilderness,” as she calls them—spaces “at the boundary of the urban and the wild.” Orchards are one of these places.

Kumar posits that apple trees, then, may serve as a catalyst to interest in ecological restoration: Connecting people with the natural sources of their food can be an important first step, and apples are relatable to most people. Her quest to find old apple trees in the wilds of New Mexico connects the dots along 400 years of production to a time when people were more in touch with nature. She writes:

To absorb the significance of biodiversity loss and climate change, it helps to engage with the biosphere that enables life on this planet, including our own. This book is one map of what such engagement could look like.

The text is structured over 14 calendar months, with Kumar first reviewing the history of apples in North America, and eventually taking readers on a journey into the apple orchard world, introducing farmers and ranchers, as well as New Mexico–based orchardist Gordon Tooley. In addition to pruning and protecting the trees, Tooley propagates them so their genetics can persist, and he gives the apples descriptive names when variety designations have been lost, such as “Nearly Dead apple.” Maintaining these older varieties can create genetic resources for apple breeders in a period where the gene pool appears to be shrinking. Apples have historically been extremely diverse in North America, but approximately 80 percent of apple varieties unique to the region have been lost. According to Tooley, “No genus can afford to lose that much variety.” Historic orchards that contain rare varieties of apples are not protected in ways that other kinds of land are. Kumar writes that 90 percent of all the apples sold in chain grocery stores come from only 11 varieties, and “81 percent of all apple varieties available to gardeners, orchard keepers, chefs, and cider-makers are endangered. Perhaps rare heirloom varieties of fruit trees on public and private lands should be offered similar protection as endangered trees or birds.”

Although Kumar seeks to link our connection to apples with ecological interest and activism, her writing is strongest when she focuses on conserving native plants and natural habitats, rather than preserving apple trees. The text feels much more cohesive and purposeful when she writes about different kinds of gardening, such as straw-bale gardening to help guard against the effects of global warming, or what she calls “wild gardening,” reenvisioning how we grow plants (and for whom).

It was a one-two punch of news, with the exciting part for us being the introduction of an EREV F-150. The other fist of news, while somewhat predictable, was maybe even more important and timed to be released after the market closed. Ford is changing its big EV plans and paying the price for it this year.

The big picture of it all is interesting to me, so it’ll lead The Morning Dump today. I think Ford is getting off easy, especially when you look at other trends. The earliest report of November EV sales shows a huge 40% drop. In Europe, Volkswagen is closing a plant for the first time in 88 years. Can you guess what it makes?

And, finally, GM has done ok in the EV space, but there’s one big drawback to buying most GM EVs. Will the company’s latest move fix this problem?

Ford Didn’t Get Off Easy, But It Could Have Been Worse

When Ford announced last year that it was creating a Skunkworks team to develop a sub-$30k EV separate from all the other electric vehicles it was developing, it was clear that the company was having serious second thoughts about whether or not it could make big electric cars work.

It’s long been my view, and David’s view, and Lucid founder Peter Rawlinson’s view that the battery technology is just not there to make big EVs work as well as EREVs can. With the exception of the Mustang GTD, Ford is a mainstream brand that makes the biggest chunk of its money from selling trucks to people who do work or, at least, people who like to imagine doing work. It does this at a massive scale, moving somewhere around three-quarters of a million F-Series trucks a year.

It’s no surprise then that Ford’s view was that it could build a lot of big electric vehicles for that kind of customer. A big three-row SUV, a couple of trucks, and an electric van. All extremely Ford products.

With the announcement that it was discontinuing the all-EV F-150 Lightning and making it an EREV instead, Ford also mentioned it was giving up its big EV dream and focusing on other things.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

These actions provide a path to profitability in Model e by 2029, targeting annual improvements beginning in 2026. The actions will also improve profits in Ford Blue and Ford Pro over time with early signs of benefits in 2026. As a result, Ford expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items, the majority in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the remainder in 2026 and 2027.

As part of these special items, the company expects approximately $5.5 billion in cash effects, with the majority paid in 2026 and the remainder in 2027. To support these actions, Ford and its subsidiaries plan to hire thousands of people across America, reinforcing the company’s leadership as the top employer of U.S. hourly autoworkers.

That $19.5 billion is Ford cancelling most of its big EV plans, including the three-row (widely expected) and the electric van (also, not a surprise). Ford says it’ll keep the affordable, probably Maverick-sized EV truck it teased earlier this year, built on the company’s Universal EV Platform.

The key words in all of this are “choice” and “affordability.” Looking at the relative success of an automaker like Hyundai, Ford thinks it’ll bring a bunch of different pieces together for different consumers, and expects that by the end of the decade, about half of its cars globally will be electrified in some manner.

While nearly $20 billion is a huge amount, I think the muted market reaction so far today is a sign that this was sort of priced in, and that the potential for profits from hybrids and trucks means Ford is better off not wasting the money.

EV Sales Down 41% In November, But Rivian Does Better

The latest EV Market Monitor from Cox Automotive shows that EV sales dropped 41.2% year-over-year and 5.2% compared to October. This was no surprise and reflects two different, but connected political realities. Last November, more people bought EVs because the election of President Trump made them fear they’d lose out on an EV tax credit. Then, in September of this year, that tax credit went away.

While most brands struggled, it wasn’t universal as Cox points out:

Despite November’s weakness, year-to-date EV sales remain 2.1% above last year’s pace. EV share of total sales fell to 5.4% in November, the lowest since April 2022 and down from October’s 5.8%. By volume, the market leaders were Tesla (39,800), Rivian (4,500), Ford (4,188), Chevrolet (3,112), and Hyundai (2,853). Tesla dropped 2.1% month over month but gained 2.2 percentage points of market share to reach 56.7%, as competitors faced even steeper declines. Several brands posted year-over-year sales volume gains, with Rivian leading at 7.6% and showing the strongest momentum. Rivian’s sales volume was up 14.1% from October.

Wow, good on Rivian.

VW Closes First Plant In Germany In 88 Years

If you want to have a bookend for modern Volkswagen, I don’t think you can do better than the Dresden Glass Factory. It was built to produce the VW Phaeton, which, while a car I love, was a good example of the insanity of peak-Piech era thinking. It’ll be the first plant to close in VW’s post-WWII history, and the last vehicle to roll off the assembly in is an ID.3 EV created in the company’s whiplash response to Dieselgate.

The plant will be taken over by a VW-led partnership:

From DFP via MSN:

From January 2026, Volkswagen, Saxony and the Technical University (TU) of Dresden are entering into a strategic partnership and will put the Transparent Factory to new uses.

The plan is to create an innovation centre for key technology fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, microelectronics and chip design.

The TU intends to use almost half of the space in the factory in future. The 230 employees are to keep their jobs in Dresden for the time being.

“For the time being” is how long, exactly? Asking for a friend.

GM Will Get Apple Music

General Motors makes a nice EV, and is one of the few companies that is well-positioned to keep making a wide range of EVs into the future. The company also doesn’t put Apple CarPlay or Android Auto in most of these cars, and plans to remove the software from future vehicles. This sucks!

The company is starting to make some improvements, though, by at least offering Apple Music and podcast apps (hopefully, Apple Podcasts) to its vehicles. Here’s what the company said in a press release:

To make listening effortless, GM is making audio streaming standard through OnStar Basics for all 2025 and newer vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. That means customers can access their favorite music, audiobook, podcast, and news apps — including Apple Music — at no additional connectivity cost for eight years with their vehicle purchase.

“We are bringing the Apple Music app to GM vehicles in a way that takes full advantage of our industry-leading audio capabilities,” said Tim Twerdahl, GM’s vice president of global product management. “It’s the latest example of how we’re expanding entertainment choices built directly into our vehicles.”

This does sound like, after eight years, you’ll have to pay to use basic apps.

Cancellation of US federal tax credits for EV purchases also contributed to the decision.

""Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs, and regulatory changes,"" the company said in its announcement.

""This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable Ford,"" said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. ""The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.""

Of course, this leaves assembly plants idle and battery plants with no customer for their cells. Ford's plan is to convert its BlueOval City in Tennessee, a greenfield project built specifically to make EVs, to a pickup truck plant. That plant was built to assemble 500,000 EVs annually.

Battery cells from Ford's Kentucky and Michigan plants will be used for the company's new stationary energy storage business targeting data centers. That will mean 20 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells going to data centers instead of EVs in 2027.

Ford has not only killed the Lightning EV, but also the work in progress toward a battery-electric mainstream F-150 called Project T3. When Ford announced Project T3, Farley said, ""Project T3 is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to revolutionize America's truck. We are melding 100 years of Ford truck know-how with world-class electric vehicle, software, and aerodynamics talent."" The T3 F-150 was to have hit showrooms in 2026.

Ford has declared its new EV strategy is built on these four pillars:

This means focusing on Ford's Universal EV Platform, the simplified EV developed from the company's skunkworks project that is slated to result in production of a mid-size electric pickup at the Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.

The current F-150 Lightning EV will be replaced by a new extended-range electric vehicle that the company promises will retain the current truck's electric-only power delivery and sub-five-second 0 – 60 mph acceleration, but with a combustion-powered generator aboard that will provide more than 700 miles of driving range.

Ford has also killed off planned new electric vans for the United States and European markets. Europe will continue with its existing electrified van models, while the US will add a new, more affordable commercial van with gas and hybrid versions that will be built at the company's Ohio Assembly Plant in Sheffield, OH.

The Ohio plant will be renamed the Ford Pro hub, while the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center becomes the Tennessee Truck Plant. The battery plant in Glendale, KY, will produce five-megawatt stationary battery storage packs using the factory's prismatic-style LFP cells. This will be packaged in a 20-foot container for transportability, with production starting by mid-2027.

Ford partnered with SK On to build the Kentucky battery plant and another one in Tennessee. The partners have struck a deal that sees Ford take complete control of the Kentucky plant as part of its stationary energy strategy, while SK On will own and operate the Tennessee plant.

The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, MI, will partially pivot to stationary energy storage too.

On Dec. 15, the Michigan-based automaker outlined its vision for the future of electric vehicle production, which is set to be slow down and be reorganized, impacting BlueOval City.

Here's what we know so far about how the restructuring will change things at the Tennessee plant.

What will Ford's Tennessee Truck Plant produce?

BlueOval City was previously expected to produce Ford's next generation of electric trucks — but no longer. Now, the West Tennessee facility will create new “Built Ford Tough” gas-powered trucks, which the company described as ""affordable.""

""The company is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturingfootprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storagebusiness,"" Ford's statement read. ""As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.""

Reflecting that change, the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center has been renamed to the Tennessee Truck Plant.

When will production begin at the Tennessee Truck Plant?

The start of production has faced numerous setbacks and delays since the BlueOval City project was first announced in September 2021. Back then, production was originally expected to start in 2025.

Among the most recent delays, in June, Ford informed suppliers and employees of plans to delay mass production of its new electric trucks at BlueOval City until 2028. Prototype builds were still set to start at BlueOval City in 2027.

Now, production of ""Built Ford Tough"" trucks in Tennessee is expected to begin in 2029.

How many jobs will be created at Ford's new Tennessee plant?

Ford's restructuring will reduce the number of jobs that will be created at the BlueOval City plant. Originally, the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center was expected to employ 3,300 people — that number has now been reduced to 2,300.

That's not including the 80 salaried employees — the leadership staff — Ford announced had been hired during a tour in May at the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center.

Ford said it plans to hire thousands of new employees across the U.S. in next few years, including that 2,300 in Tennessee, 2,100 employees at the battery plant in Kentucky, and additional employees at the Ohio assembly plant.

What other changes has Ford made to its electric vehicle production nationwide?

Ford's primary electric vehicle production will take place at the Louisville Assembly Plant, where a midsize electric truck will begin production in 2027. The next generation of Ford's electric F-150 Lightning will be shifted to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) model in Dearborn, Michigan.

Ford scrapped plans for a new electric commercial van for Europe. It also plans to replace a similar van for North America with both gas and hybrid models.

A new business focused around a battery energy storage system is also being launched by Ford. The existing U.S. battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Kentucky, will be repurposed ""to serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market.""

Ford said the reduction of electric vehicle manufacturing is ""consistent"" with the company's goal of becoming carbon neutral across its vehicles, manufacturing facilities and supply chain no later than 2050. The automotive company still expects approximately 50% of its global volume to be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030.","https://www.commercialappeal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/08/PMCA/83520602007-250508-blue-oval-statue-05.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-16 18:59:48.496227

He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry.
His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware.
This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.","This story was originally published by Canary Media.

David Stevenson stood in a circle of friends and colleagues in an Orlando, Florida, hotel lobby. Everyone but him wore a lapel pin that read ​“I ♥ Fossil Fuels.”

“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”

Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.

But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in U.S. waters.

The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​“The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.

Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”

And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.

The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.

Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes” — not wind development — were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.

At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power — the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance — appeared to be on the downswing, with many U.S. facilities having recently shuttered.

We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.

I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.

The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the U.S. seems impossible.

The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.

Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.

A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.

“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved. … I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.

Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own — namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.

“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction … and tactics that delay action.”

* * *

Stevenson, now 75, describes himself as ​“a lifelong conservationist.”

In the driveway of his Lewes, Delaware, home sits the hybrid vehicle he often drives to a nearby beach. Solar panels glint atop the roof, which Stevenson custom-designed in 2013 to be at the ​“optimum angle” to soak up the sun. A framed newspaper article about one of his cross-country bike rides hangs on the wall of his home office, nestled alongside photos of his seven children and 19 grandchildren.

His career has intersected with clean energy — and even wind — at various points.

While working for DuPont in the 1980s, Stevenson helped the chemical giant develop the long-lasting coatings used to make first-generation solar panels and wind turbine blades. In 1999, after leaving the company, he started his own construction business and acquired certifications in energy efficiency and home weatherization. He said he eventually co-founded the Delaware Green Building Council to promote this kind of work.

But despite Stevenson’s environmentally minded career and interests, he’s built a reputation as someone dedicated to preventing, rather than enabling, renewable energy.

After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”

According to the D.C.-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.

For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.

It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.

Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm — a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware — were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”

The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.

“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”

At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration — first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.

Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.

He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.

The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”

Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.

Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”

In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone — ​“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.

He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.

Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them — as the Brown University researchers put it — was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.

His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.

There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the east coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.

Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.

In January 2023, right-wing media took an interest in whales. There had been a slew of marine mammal deaths along the east coast of the U.S. in prior weeks — and conservative media put the blame on seismic surveys for the future offshore wind developments ramping up along the New Jersey coast. Fox News host Jesse Watters interviewed a leader of Protect Our Coasts NJ, a founding coalition member that Stevenson had helped become a nonprofit.

This wasn’t the first time the media had amplified baseless speculation about wind power killing whales. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, had run a similar story in 2017. But in early 2023, the claims were getting attention from Fox, local news, and even the Associated Press.

Stevenson was in near disbelief when he heard Tucker Carlson, then a commentator on Fox News, mention offshore wind and whales in multiple segments.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.

I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”

But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the ​Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted that the campaign prompted a U.S. General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)

Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms.

Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”

The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the U.S. — during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities — and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.

Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.

As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”

In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”

In this ongoing phenomena, 40% of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.

I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”

Trump wasted no time coming after offshore wind when he took office in January 2025. On day one, he issued an anti-wind executive order that paused all permitting activity and derided the installations as ​“big” and ​“ugly” to an indoor stadium full of supporters.

For Stevenson and a dozen others in his influential cohort, the executive order was a good step — but it wasn’t enough to simply block new projects from advancing. In February, they petitioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue stop-work orders to the installations already being built, alleging that the projects posed a risk to whales. This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.

And it wasn’t long before the Trump administration tried to give the Stevenson-led coalition what it wanted. All five of the offshore wind projects under construction in America either have been delayed by recent stop-work orders or are reportedly under threat of receiving one.

Some in the coalition opposed such moves, recognizing that stopping projects already underway would raise energy costs. Steve Haner, a senior fellow at the Virginia-based conservative think tank Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, refused to endorse Stevenson’s petition to pause the five projects under construction — objecting especially to halting America’s largest project, a 2.5-gigawatt wind farm being built off the Virginia coast.

Under a hypothetical cancellation, according to Haner, ​“the ratepayers are on the hook” for the billions in sunk costs.

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction — but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings” — an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf” — which helped secure a reversal from Trump.

Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.

At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.

Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built in America for the next decade — save for the five already under construction.

Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term.

“They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.

It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.

Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives — ones that go beyond whales — for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the U.S. vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)

Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”

The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change — and what to do about it — evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”

“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’ … A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”

These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”

Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​“Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment.” The book came out in early fall — just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life with a decade-long delay of U.S. offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.

Nowadays, Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.

“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”

All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas — which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal — was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.

Republican moderates in Washington have expressed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, utility bills, which Stevenson called his ​“primary motivation” for his anti-wind work, have skyrocketed in the Northeast and are projected to only climb higher if Trump’s policies continue to strangle the offshore wind sector.

Stevenson has increasingly drifted from the direction that other coalition members are taking. Protect Our Coast NJ — which first fanned the flames of misleading claims about whales — has embarked on a different disinformation campaign: spreading the false idea that offshore wind cables cause cancer. Embracing outlandish claims — whether it’s whale-killing ​“windmills” or cancer-causing cables — is a broader trend among Republicans who buy into conspiracy theories with their party’s rise to power.

Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32% jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.

“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy. … You don’t want 100% believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Madison–Wisconsin who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the U.S. is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.

Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seemed relieved to be doing so.

On our most recent call, in late November, Stevenson told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)

He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” Stevenson told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry — and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.

Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed offshore wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.

Stevenson also told me on the phone that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. Exxon Mobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.

I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.

I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view — that readers might see it that way.

“I don’t care if people hate me or not,” he said. ​“I’m doing what I think is right.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/12/stevenson-armchair-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 17:00:00.328617

Moller Group, has signed a long-term deal with Microsoft for carbon removal credits generated at a bio-methanol plant that would be built at the site of a shuttered paper mill in central Louisiana.

C2X is developing the Beaver Lake bio-methanol production project near Pineville in Rapides Parish at the site of the former International Paper mill, which closed in 2009.

The $2.4 billion plant, according to Houston-based C2X, is being designed to convert locally sourced forestry thinnings, treetops and sawmill residues into bio-methanol for consumption by global and U.S. customers in the shipping, aviation, chemicals and industrial sectors, with commercial operations expected to begin in 2029.

“The Beaver Lake project combines the benefits of bio-methanol production for customers in hard-to-abate sectors with permanent carbon removals,” said Brian Davis, CEO of C2X.

Under the agreement, Beaver Lake will deliver carbon removal units, each representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere and stored in secure geologic formations in Louisiana, which Microsoft will use to meet its carbon negative goals.

The Beaver Lake project will deliver 3.6 million removal units to Microsoft over a 12-year period, according to C2X. Microsoft plans to be carbon negative by 2030. Through its internal carbon fee funds, the tech giant reports it has purchased more than 30 billion kilowatt-hours of green power and reduced emissions by 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

Phillip Goodman, director of carbon removal portfolio at Microsoft, said the Beaver Lake project provides an opportunity for large-scale carbon removal and also drives broader decarbonization initiatives through the production of green methanol.

C2X expects more than 1,150 construction jobs along with more than 600 direct and indirect jobs.

The Beaver Lake project is the first of several green methanol production facilities planned by C2X. In 2023, the company signed a framework agreement with the Egyptian government for a potential facility near the Suez Canal for the production of up to 1 million tons of green methanol annually.

C2X is majority owned by A.P. Moller Group, parent company of Maersk, the world’s second largest container shipping company. ENEOS, Japan’s largest integrated energy company, is a minority shareholder in the company.

Buck Vandestern, executive director of the Louisiana Forestry Association, said the Beaver Lake project could help replace jobs lost following the closure of three of the state’s paper mills during the last two decades. In April, the International Paper Co mill shut down in Campti in Natchitoches Parish, where 481 workers lost their jobs.

“We recognize the great potential in Louisiana to expand the forestry industry‘s base,” said Vandestern. “We have thousands of landowners who have done an excellent job growing trees, to the point now that we’re growing 70% more wood than what we’re taking out of the forest. And this also creates some challenges in keeping our forests healthy.”

Vandestern said that Drax, a U.K.-based firm seeing to reduce its greenhouse footprint, imports wood pellets processed by Morehouse BioEnergy at the former Bastrop paper mill. These pellets are used to generate electricity at a plant in North Yorkshire, England.

“A focus today is on the energy-related industries, where they’re configuring the molecules of wood into different compounds that can be used in the transportation, the aviation, and the shipping industries,” said Vandestern.

The company is expected to create 200 direct new jobs with an average salary of $90,000, which is 28% above the average St. James Parish wage. Louisiana Economic Development (LED) estimates the project will result in an additional 554 indirect new jobs, for a total of 754 potential new job opportunities in the Southeast Region.

“ElementUSA’s investment in Gramercy is a game-changer for the region, strengthening Louisiana’s role in advanced manufacturing while securing a domestic supply of critical minerals used in defense operations,” President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc. Michael Hecht said. “At a time when global supply chains are under pressure, this project helps ensure the materials the nation depends on are refined in the United States. It also raises the state’s profile as a place where complex, strategic projects can move quickly from concept to reality.”

“ElementUSA’s investment marks a major step in strengthening America’s critical minerals supply chain, and Louisiana is proud to play a leading role in that effort,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “This project advances essential mineral production in the United States and positions Louisiana’s workers and communities at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry. As President Trump has consistently said, strengthening America’s industrial base is a top priority, and Louisiana is delivering the projects that turn that vision into reality.”

Facility Development and Production Plans

ElementUSA will use its proprietary processes to extract gallium, scandium, iron and other critical minerals from more than 30 million tons of bauxite residue, the byproduct of the alumina refining process. Supported by a $29.9 million U.S. Department of Defense grant, the company will first construct a demonstration facility to validate its extraction process and guide the design of a future commercial-scale facility.

“We are humbled and energized by the Department of War’s trust in ElementUSA at this pivotal moment for America’s critical minerals landscape,” CEO of ElementUSA Ellis Sullivan said. “This project in Gramercy will demonstrate how the United States can produce gallium and scandium at scale using innovative extraction technologies, reducing foreign dependence and ensuring our warfighters and industries have reliable access to these strategic materials.”

“Louisiana has supported this effort for more than four years, and that partnership has been instrumental to our progress. Now, with federal support in place, we can advance our prototype facility and move toward our full-scale vision: a world-class plant in Louisiana capable of processing over one million tons of bauxite residue annually and producing a suite of essential minerals including gallium, scandium and iron that will strengthen America’s industrial base and national security.”

Since announcing its initial plans in 2021, the company has advanced its technology and development work at the Gramercy site to support domestic critical mineral production. Over the past several years, ElementUSA has refined its proprietary extraction process and evaluated the site’s bauxite residue resources, laying the groundwork for this next phase of investment.

“ElementUSA’s investment decision is another clear sign that Louisiana’s strategy is working,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “By strengthening our competitiveness, aligning agencies through a whole-of-government model, and listening directly to companies, we’ve built the conditions that turn interest into investment. This project brings high-quality jobs, new industry capabilities and long-term advantages for Louisiana and the U.S.”

Construction of the demonstration facility is expected to begin in mid-2027, with initial production targeted for the third quarter of 2028.

“This project is a significant investment in our community, providing hundreds of new direct and indirect jobs; however, it’s also an investment in America,” St. James Parish President Pete Dufresne said. “Enhancing the United States’ only alumina processing facility, providing roughly 40% of the country’s alumina, is a critical investment in our nation’s future.”

LED Incentive Packages

To win the project in Gramercy, the state of Louisiana offered ElementUSA a competitive incentives package that includes the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart and a $6 million performance-based grant for utility and infrastructure improvements. The company is also expected to participate in Louisiana’s Quality Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption programs.

The investment follows closely on the heels of Aclara Resources announcing a $277 million heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish.

Both projects received Louisiana Economic Development support centered on workforce training through LED FastStart and performance-based infrastructure grants, though at different scales. ElementUSA was offered a $6 million grant along with participation in the Quality Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption programs, while Aclara Resources received a $3 million grant and is expected to participate in the High Impact Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption programs.

Together, the projects point to Louisiana’s growing competitiveness in attracting critical minerals and rare earth processing operations tied to national supply chain and defense priorities.

Federal Efforts to Reshore Rare Earth Processing

The projects align with broader federal efforts to build a domestic rare earth and critical minerals supply chain as the United States works to reduce its reliance on China, which currently dominates global production and processing of many of these materials.

Rare earth elements are essential inputs for semiconductors, defense systems, electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies, and industry analysts have warned that concentrated foreign supply can expose U.S. manufacturers to price volatility and supply disruptions.

Developing domestic processing capacity is expected to improve supply stability over time and could help moderate costs for U.S. technology and advanced manufacturing sectors.

BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, MI, a $3.5 billion project set to open in 2026, originally would have focused on providing Ford some of the infrastructure needed to produce EVs.

Now, after losing $13 billion since 2023 on its EV business, plants like the one being built in Marshall will be refocused towards battery storage to support things such as utilities, wind and solar power developers and data centers.

The move, in tandem with Ford's decision to drastically scale back EV production, reflects American consumers wanting smaller, more affordable models when it comes to EVs and having concerns about battery range or access to charging stations, according to the Wallstreet Journal.

The opportunity cost of failing to power the AI revolution is too high for American innovation to ignore—market and regulatory forces are already converging to deliver affordable, cleaner, efficient, and reliable energy solutions.

COMMENTARY

Historically, calls for an energy transition, often framed under ESG (environmental, social, governance) principles, had gained traction. The business community embraced this with one caveat: they needed to ensure economic viability and shareholder returns. Around the same time, Generative AI, notably ChatGPT, emerged as a transformative technology poised for unprecedented disruption. Suddenly, the abstract need for more power became an urgent, concrete, and highly valuable commercial demand.

The AI boom extends beyond data and machine learning; it demands immense and rapidly escalating energy to power the data centers forming its foundation. Demand is skyrocketing: the International Energy Agency forecasts global data center energy consumption could reach 1,720 TWh by 2035 under certain conditions—exceeding Japan’s current electricity usage.

Scaling AI will have its challenges. The real bottleneck is not desire; it’s delivery. Our nation’s model for deploying capital to expand our grid infrastructure and permitting and interconnection processes, designed for a different era, are now face to face with the exponential speed of technological progress. Recent surveys indicate that permitting and application processes are the most significant barriers to energy supply growth, often exacerbating capital costs through delays.

However, the U.S. regulatory apparatus is actively adapting. Acknowledging rapid growth in large commercial and industrial electricity demand, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate rulemaking procedures.

FERC responded to the directive by issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR), aiming to promote efficient and timely access to transmission service for large electrical loads and highlighting AI data centers as a critical new class of facilities that require accelerated grid access.

This raises the critical question: where is the capital to fuel the needed infrastructure going to come from? The old method of regulators setting customer rates to fund capital projects, interconnections and the grid is not going to be sufficient. Capital will need to come from other sources, including private equity, the capital markets, and tech companies. That private equity, which typically seeks five-year returns, is already providing capital signals confidence that this challenge will be resolved quickly.

Diverse approaches will be necessary, evolving through several potential pathways. For instance, tech giants have increasingly bypassed the congested grid by financing dedicated, “behind-the-meter” power sources, such as co-located natural gas plants or solar farms with battery storage. Similarly, urgency from the tech sector may compel an unprecedented level of collaboration between utilities, regulators, and developers, a partnership that has been elusive for decades.

Another path includes significant investment and innovation in Grid-Enhancing Technologies (GETs) and large-scale battery storage to radically improve the efficiency and capacity of the existing grid. New energy efficiency solutions that monitor AI model costs and computing will also continue to advance. Interestingly, AI itself should help grid operators more efficiently move and balance load and capacity.

Energy leaders will be best served to focus on the elements in their control: coordinating with regulators, deploying capital at pace, connecting energy resources to the grid, building resiliencies where appropriate, creating the right deal structures for financing the future, and scenario planning for different regulatory outcomes. Although challenges to costs and permitting processes remain, the industry has reached a crucial turning point where it’s no longer waiting for perfect conditions to act.

Ultimately, a combination of these strategies will likely create a dynamic, competitive ecosystem aimed at a singular goal: delivering affordable power, fast. The central question is whether the regulatory framework can adapt quickly enough to enable this transformation, or if it will remain a primary bottleneck. The outcome will determine the pace of both the energy transition and the AI revolution.

Therefore, the critical issue for 2026 and beyond is not if we will have enough energy, but how it will be delivered. The path taken will have profound implications for the U.S. economy, its energy landscape, and its leadership in our technological future.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fig1-stocksnap-transmission-distribution-td.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 16:01:15.078624

Small businesses need affordable energy to grow and operate

Small businesses are pushing for legislation to provide affordable energy options. The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act and the Energy Choice Act have advanced in Congress and would help bolster domestic energy production.

The SPEED Act heads to the U.S. House floor, aiming to clarify ambiguous provisions and expedite environmental review processes. The Energy Choice Act would stop state and local governments from banning energy services based on the type of energy. It was approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and will advance to the full House floor for a vote.

In NFIB’s most recent Problems and Priorities survey, small business owners ranked the cost of natural gas, propane, gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil as their sixth most pressing issue. Many small business owners have felt the impact of growing energy costs and have had to take extreme measures to adjust.

“As the owner of a powder coating company, reliable and affordable energy; especially natural gas, is essential to my ability to operate and grow. Here in Massachusetts, moratoriums on new natural gas service and the blocking of pipeline projects have restricted my capacity to expand, increased my operating costs, and undermined my competitiveness. These policies ultimately force higher costs onto my customers and hinder local manufacturing,” said NFIB Member Korey Bell, Westside Finishing Co., Inc. in Holyoke, Massachusetts.

With the demand for energy at an all-time high, the need for domestic energy has never been greater. Both the SPEED Act and the Energy Choice Act will help facilitate the production of American energy, providing reliable and affordable energy options. Read NFIB’s letter of support for the Energy Choice Act for a deeper look at the benefits this bill provides for small businesses.

The State Energy Planning Board (Board), chaired by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris, voted unanimously today to approve a State Energy Plan (Plan). The Plan includes recommendations, which are based on findings from more than a year-long assessment of current systems and future energy needs through 2040, that will guide the State’s energy-related decision making.

Today’s approval of the Plan advances multiple objectives of the State including ensuring affordable, abundant, reliable, and clean energy while supporting economic development, equity, and a healthy environment. The plan embraces the State's continued commitment to renewables while also noting that a variety of energy sources, like advanced nuclear and natural gas, will be needed to help New York meet its overall energy needs over the next 15 years.

NYSERDA President and CEO and State Energy Planning Board Chair Doreen M. Harris said, “The State Energy Plan is the product of a pragmatic and objective process that comes at a critical yet challenging time for energy planning in New York as we continue to build out renewable resources while factoring in new energy demands and confronting federal headwinds. I commend my fellow Board members and state agency staff for their dedication to developing this Plan, which identifies specific actions to advance over the next several years while maintaining resource diversity – which is key to continued energy reliability and affordability for all New Yorkers.”

The Plan was developed at a time when the energy sector faces significant uncertainty stemming from economic pressures and a shift in federal priorities and policies away from renewable energy projects. The analyses conducted for the Plan have been updated to reflect the latest available data and federal actions since modelling was completed for the Draft Plan released in July 2025. Updates also included further focus on energy affordability considerations and strategies to manage system costs, including through demand-side flexibility and added discussion of new, large loads and ways to manage associated grid and cost impacts.

The analyses inform five primary planning goals and associated actions to continue to meet New York's energy needs which include:

delivering abundant, reliable, resilient and clean energy through a diverse mix of resources and supply infrastructure, while supporting energy efficiency and load flexibility;

providing affordable energy to households and equitable benefits – with a focus on reducing the upfront costs of efficiency and clean energy choices to help cut spending and lessen the burden for lower-income households;

supporting economic growth and competitiveness by investing in workforce development, meeting the needs of large energy users, and attracting new industry, including clean energy leaders;

strengthening partnerships across New York’s innovation ecosystem to foster economic development, create jobs, and provide greater leverage for State investments; and

continuing progress toward decarbonization and a clean energy economy.

Fact sheets summarizing the analyses are available on the State Energy Plan website .

The process to update the State Energy Plan was announced in August 2024. The State Energy Planning Board , comprised of the heads of ten State agencies and authorities, appointees from the Governor, Senate, and Assembly, and the president of the New York Independent System Operator, commenced its work to assess and compile data to inform the Draft State Energy Plan, which was released in July 2025 for public review and comment.

The release of the 2025 Plan follows a robust public comment period which included 10 public hearings, seven in-person and three virtual, and written comment. The State Energy Planning Board received and considered nearly 15,000 written comments and more than 1,000 people attended public hearings, with nearly 450 providing oral comments – which were also considered. The Board received input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including individual New Yorkers, environmental organizations, utilities and energy companies, labor unions, and trade and business organizations, underscoring the importance of the Plan’s focus on energy affordability and maintaining an abundant and diverse mix of energy sources and supply infrastructure.

Successful implementation of the Plan will involve State agency coordination, partnership with all levels of government and local communities, and participation of private sector entities invested in New York’s energy future. The Board is required to prepare biennial reports every second year following the issuance of a State Energy Plan that discuss the ability of the State and private markets to implement the policies, programs, and other recommendations in the Plan and recommend new or amended policies as needed. Interested parties are encouraged to sign up for email updates on the Plan .

New York State Public Service Commission Chair Rory M. Christian said, “New York State has long focused on ensuring plentiful, affordable, reliable, and clean energy services to the citizens of New York. Energy planning is far from a simple endeavor. Each iteration of the State energy plan has focused on addressing immediate needs and proactively addressing challenges on the horizon. Today, we have many challenges.

New York State's Climate Agenda

New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors. The State is also working to disburse the historic $1 billion Sustainable Future Program, which will deliver targeted funding to lower emissions, reduce household energy costs, and spur green job growth.",https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Assets/Common/Images/favicons/nyserda/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-16 14:00:23.141139

LMR: Performance without the premium The north star of GM’s future roadmap is commercializing LMR, which Kelty describes as a ""step change"" in battery technology.
""LMR unlocks the premium range and performance at an affordable cost,"" Kelty explains during his Battery Show 2025 keynote.
Swapping that for an LFP pack would save roughly $6,000 in battery costs, but range would drop to 350 miles.
The company can now model changes in battery chemistry and instantly predict impacts on safety, cost, range, and charging rates.","For years, the electric vehicle (EV) industry has been locked in a struggle between two dominant battery chemistries. On one side, you have Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC), the high-energy, long-range champion that powers premium vehicles but comes with a steep price tag. On the other hand, there is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP), the affordable, durable workhorse that sacrifices range for cost savings. Automakers have largely been forced to choose between giving the customer range anxiety or sticker shock.

But according to Kurt Kelty, General Motors’ Vice President of Battery Propulsion and Sustainability, the industry is on the verge of breaking this trade-off. GM is preparing to deploy a “Goldilocks” chemistry that promises the best of both worlds: Lithium Manganese Rich (LMR) technology.

Kelty, an industry veteran with over 30 years of experience dating back to Panasonic’s early work in the 1990s, outlines a strategy that moves beyond incremental improvements. By fundamentally altering the chemistry and form factor of the battery cell, GM is trying to achieve the holy grail of mass electrification.

LMR: Performance without the premium

The north star of GM’s future roadmap is commercializing LMR, which Kelty describes as a ""step change"" in battery technology.

Historically, high-performance EV batteries relied heavily on nickel for energy density and cobalt for thermal stability. While effective, these materials are expensive and subject to volatile supply chains. The industry responded by reducing cobalt in favor of higher nickel content, creating the ""high nickel"" chemistries that dominate the US market today.

LMR takes a different path. It dramatically reduces reliance on both nickel and cobalt by replacing them with manganese. Manganese is abundant, affordable, and sourced globally, which makes it an attractive candidate for scaling production.

""LMR unlocks the premium range and performance at an affordable cost,"" Kelty explains during his Battery Show 2025 keynote. ""We've got range approaching that of the high nickel, but at a cost similar to the LFP.""

The implications for vehicle packaging are significant. Kelty illustrates this with the Chevrolet Silverado EV. Currently, equipping the truck with a high-nickel battery pack yields a massive 490 miles of range, but at a premium cost. Swapping that for an LFP pack would save roughly $6,000 in battery costs, but range would drop to 350 miles. Many truckers just aren’t willing to make that compromise.

LMR is a ""sweet spot"" between these extremes. It can deliver over 400 miles of range for the Silverado, but with a cost structure comparable to the cheaper LFP pack. This allows GM to maintain the utility required by truck and SUV owners (i.e., GM’s core demographic) without pricing the vehicles out of the mass market.

Leapfrogging, not copying

The push for LMR is also a strategic move against Chinese manufacturers who have mastered LFP production.

When asked about competing with China’s dominance in scale and cost efficiency, Kelty was blunt: copying the market leader is a losing strategy. ""If we just do LFP, like the Chinese are going to do, we're not going to win,"" Kelty asserted.

Instead, GM intends to ""leapfrog"" current standards by commercializing LMR, aiming to be the first automaker to bring it to market in 2028. While acknowledging that LFP has its place for entry-level, economy vehicles, Kelty views LMR as the primary engine for the mass market. This differentiation is not trivial. By offering 33% higher energy density than a similarly sized LFP cell at a comparable cost, GM hopes to insulate itself from commoditized price wars while offering a superior product.

Virtualization and safety

Moving to a manganese-rich chemistry isn't without technical hurdles. Critics and engineers alike have historically noted challenges with voltage decay and impedance at low states of charge. Furthermore, removing cobalt raises valid safety concerns regarding thermal runaway.

GM will be addressing these risks through what Kelty calls the industry's most advanced computational virtual engineering capabilities. The company can now model changes in battery chemistry and instantly predict impacts on safety, cost, range, and charging rates.

""We can model that at the cell level, we can model it at the pack level, then model it at the vehicle level, and we can do this in days,"" Kelty said, noting that such processes previously took months.

This virtualization was necessary for the new LMR cells. When Kelty’s team proposed a massive new cell format, he was initially skeptical about its safety characteristics. However, modeling predicted the cell would pass propagation tests (preventing fire from spreading from one cell to another). When physical prototypes were finally built, they performed exactly as the AI models predicted. This capability allows GM to be aggressive with chemistry changes while maintaining stringent safety standards.

Simplification via prismatic cells

Chemistry is only half the equation. Packaging is the other. GM is moving toward prismatic cell form factors for its next-generation packs, a structural change that radically simplifies the battery pack architecture.

The switch to prismatic cells is expected to reduce the number of parts in a battery pack by over 50%. This reduction lowers manufacturing complexity, reduces weight, and ultimately drives down costs. It also enables the 33% energy density gain over LFP mentioned earlier.

Localization as a strategy

Behind the technology is a massive effort to localize the supply chain. Kelty emphasizes that technical leadership must be paired with supply chain resilience. The goal is to make the supply chain ""independent and rooted in North America.""

This goes beyond just assembling battery packs in the US. GM is investing in the localized production of cathode precursors, active materials, electrolytes, and separators. By 2028, the company expects the local content of its battery cells to increase eightfold compared to today. Such vertical integration will hope to insulate the company from geopolitical shocks and reduce logistics costs, further contributing to the affordability of the final vehicle.

Beyond the vehicle: The energy ecosystem

Finally, Kelty argues that the value of these batteries extends even beyond transportation. GM is actively piloting Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies that let EVs stabilize the electric grid by discharging during peak demand and charging when prices are low.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt4d1c0fedb94784b1/69419c7692e6d65dc07c0573/GM-logo-newHQ.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-16 17:59:36.926875

Amazon commissioned an independent research firm to conduct a first-of-its-kind study examining whether data center electricity costs are subsidized by other ratepayers.

The research found that Amazon fully pays for its own electricity costs to power its data centers.

Amazon data centers can generate surplus revenue that utilities can use to invest in grid improvements for customers.

Are everyday residents paying higher electricity bills because of data centers?

As data centers power the streaming, shopping, and AI services we rely on daily, this question has become increasingly common in community conversations.

When we looked for independent research to examine this issue, we found that no comprehensive studies existed. To get a clear, data-driven answer, we commissioned research firm Energy and Environment Economics (E3) to conduct a first-of-its-kind economic impact study, while deepening our collaboration with utility partners across the country.

What drives electricity prices?

Before exploring the findings, it’s important to understand what drives electricity prices for households. Electricity prices are made up of several components, notably the cost to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity to homes and businesses. These elements together determine what customers see in their monthly statements.

A Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study found that U.S. electricity costs have increased by 23% from 2019 to 2024. The study also found that this increase was driven by multiple factors, with a significant portion coming from updating the posts and wires that carry and distribute electricity.

Most of America’s power grid is showing its age—70% of power lines were built over 25 years ago, many dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Think of it like replacing old plumbing in a house—utilities need to update these systems to keep electricity flowing reliably to all customers.

In the U.S., electricity rates are based on the costs to serve and vary by customer type: residential, commercial, and large industrial users like data centers. Utilities are increasingly adopting specialized rate structures for large industrial customers to ensure they pay for their electricity and infrastructure costs and prevent these costs from being shifted to other customers.

What did the study reveal? Amazon pays its own electricity costs

What did E3's study reveal? First and foremost, Amazon pays for its own electricity costs—these expenses aren’t added to the bills of local residents or businesses. More surprisingly, our data centers in some regions actually pay more than the costs needed to power them.

This creates a financial surplus that utilities like Entergy Mississippi, Pacific Gas and Electric, and others can use to modernize the power grid, which improves reliability for the benefit of all customers. For a typical 100-megawatt (MW) Amazon data center, this additional contribution amounts to $3.4 million in 2025 and is projected to reach $6.1 million by 2030.

Regional partnerships supporting grid modernization

E3’s study also highlights how Amazon is taking significant steps to support grid modernization and carbon-free energy development. The research shows how Amazon’s investments often support the modernization of energy infrastructure that powers its data centers and the surrounding community, which also can help keep prices lower for other customers. For example:

Virginia: In Northern Virginia, the region with most data centers in the world, a 2024 Dominion Energy earnings report noted their residential customers pay 10% below the national average for transmission costs, with large customers like data centers picking up 9% of these costs.

Mississippi: Entergy is using investments from Amazon and other large customers to fund its $300 million “Superpower Mississippi” grid reliability campaign at no cost to residential customers. As part of this plan, Entergy aims to reduce the overall frequency and duration of outages for the average Mississippi customer by approximately 50%.

California: Pacific Gas & Electric says each gigawatt of data center demand could reduce the average household electricity bill by 1% to 2%.

Oregon: Amazon’s partnership with Umatilla Electric Cooperative uses an innovative self-supply agreement where Amazon sources its own energy, including from renewable energy sources, which prevents other customers from covering those costs.

“Through our ‘Superpower Mississippi’ initiative, we’re making a $300 million investment to transform our grid like never before,” said Haley Fisackerly, president and chief executive officer of Entergy Mississippi. “Typically, these kinds of large-scale upgrades would translate to higher electricity bills for our customers. But thanks to the influx of new customers like Amazon coming to Mississippi, we’re able to fund these critical reliability improvements without passing any added costs on to our residential and small business customers. It’s a true win-win: We’re delivering a more robust, resilient grid, while ensuring our rates remain well below the national average.”

Investing in carbon-free energy

While our data centers are helping to support grid modernization and reliability improvements, we are also helping to bring new carbon-free energy to regional power grids. Amazon has invested in more than 600 solar and wind projects globally. When Amazon funds new solar panels and wind farms, that energy gets added to the power grid that serves everyone in the area, including homes, businesses, and our data centers.

Across the four states explored in the study, we’re adding approximately 4.2 GW of firm carbon-free energy to power grids, which is enough to power more than a million U.S. homes. We’re also investing billions into emerging technologies like small modular nuclear reactors to help provide reliable, carbon-free electricity for our data centers.

A collaborative approach for the future

This collaborative approach extends beyond carbon-free energy investments to every aspect of how we operate. Managing energy needs in communities requires ongoing conversations and partnerships. That’s why Amazon remains committed to working closely with our utility partners to ensure we’re paying to power our data centers, while also supporting the modernization and expansion of the grid.

As data centers continue to grow and evolve, we’ll keep monitoring our impact and adapting our approach to support the communities where we operate. By continuing this data-driven, collaborative approach, we aim to ensure that the digital future we’re building benefits everyone—both online and on their monthly utility bills.

The automaker announced a major shift in its EV plans late Monday, with the company expecting to take on about $19.5 billion in one-time charges to account for the costs of a restructuring plan that will see the automaker focus more on hybrid and plug-in vehicles, while pulling away from pure EVs. Ford said it plans to recognize most of the $19.5 billion in charges during the fourth quarter, with about $5.5 billion in cash effects to be paid through 2027.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.""

The next generation of Ford's F-150 Lightning electric truck will now be an extended-range EV rather than a fully electric vehicle. Ford said its plans to start introducing smaller, more efficient and affordable EVs remain on track for 2027.

Ford said its electric vehicle unit should be profitable by 2029 after making these changes, and that some of its battery-producing plants will shift to making stationary batteries for homes, businesses, and data centers.

General Motors (GM) and other automakers have made changes to their EV plans as well in recent months, anticipating a drop in demand after a $7,500 EV tax credit expired at the end of September. Automakers are also facing less pressure to shift to more sustainable vehicles, as the Trump administration has loosened emissions requirements.

Ford said it expects that by 2030, about half of its vehicle lineup will be made up of a combination of hybrids, EVs, or extended-range EVs, compared to about 17% of its lineup today.

The decline follows record shipments of 589 GW AC in 2024 (see China Leads 589 GW AC Global PV Inverter Shipments In 2024). Wood Mackenzie links the decline to ongoing market uncertainty across major regions, including China, Europe, and the US.

The Chinese market will see a major decline this year, its first drop since 2019, to 304 GW AC in 2025, an annual loss of 5%. The analysts cite policy uncertainty for this decline, as the country transitions from the 14th to the 15th Five-Year Plan. Yet, it will maintain its dominance in this space with a cumulative inverter demand of more than 2.9 TW AC through 2034, adds Wood Mackenzie.

Asia Pacific excluding China (APeC) will grow to 89 GW AC in 2025 as domestic manufacturing takes off in India and Southeast Asia, along with the emergence of rooftop PV segments.

For the European market, persisting inventory challenges and reduced utility-scale capture prices in key markets like Spain will likely bring down the shipments to 83 GW AC in 2025 from 88 GW AC in 2024. Inverter shipments will continue to decline below 75 GW AC annually by 2032 in this part of the world.

The US, Wood Mackenzie projects, will be a 47 GW AC market this year before declining 22% in 2026 as tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are phased out.

“After years of an exponential rise in solar inverter demand, continuous shipment growth is no longer realistic for even the top global inverter manufacturers,” said Wood Mackenzie Research Analyst Joe Shangraw. “Instead, vendors will need to adapt to new demand drivers to stay competitive: hybrid solar-plus-storage systems, retrofits and repowering, cybersecurity features, 2000-volt architectures, and grid services.”

Strong competition from Chinese manufacturers and ongoing technology improvements continue to put downward pressure on prices across all categories. Wood Mackenzie expects the steepest price decline for utility-scale inverters with Chinese domestic 3-phase string inverters to fall below $0.02/W AC, while central standalone inverters will approach $0.01/W AC by 2034.

Nevertheless, Shangraw sees the solar inverter market recovering and growing beyond 2024 levels by the early 2030s on the back of rising electrification, AI-driven power demand, and inverter replacements.

The WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies marked a historic breakthrough: the first global rules targeting subsidies that contribute directly to overfishing and overcapacity.","Trend 1: Exposing Harm from Subsidies Beyond Market Distortion

When the World Trade Organization (WTO) was created in 1995, subsidies took centre stage in global trade rules. Economic thinking of the time was clear: subsidies were distortions that pushed prices below their ""true"" cost, shielded inefficient industries, and discouraged innovation.

As Shruti Sharma, Lead at IISD Energy, recalls: ""There was no climate or inequity agenda in this conversation. The main concern was just fiscal discipline and efficiency.""

The debate zeroed in on unfair competition from major agricultural subsidizers. ""Agriculture subsidies were creating oversupply and lowering global prices. The aim was to level the playing field,"" notes IISD policy analyst Facundo Calvo. This concern contributed to shaping the WTO Agriculture Agreement, which introduced the first global rules to curb trade-distorting farm support and improve market access for agricultural products.

By the late 1990s, the debate broadened. Scholars and environmental groups began asking not only whether subsidies distort markets, but whether they cause environmental harm.

""We began assessing subsidies—distorting or not—based on the harm they caused.""

Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, Vice President

A turning point came in 1997, when the Earth Council published the first independent estimate of global subsidies across agriculture, energy, water, and transport. The figure neared USD 1 trillion, and much of it was shown to undermine sustainable development.

It added a new layer to the narrative. ""The focus moved beyond distortions,"" says IISD's Vice President, Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder. ""We began assessing subsidies—distorting or not—based on the harm they caused.""

Think tanks and civil society stepped in, and IISD's Global Subsidies Initiative became a leading voice calling out environmentally harmful support. Analysts started assessing subsidies not just by their production and trade effects, but by their impact on people and nature—whether through deforestation, pollution, increased emissions, collapsing fisheries, or unhealthy food systems.

Trend 2: Shifting Subsidies to Fix Market Failures

When subsidies are viewed through lenses other than those of pure economic efficiency, however, complexity enters the story. They can harm ecosystems, but they can also protect people and drive innovation.

Food systems are a clear example. Subsidized cheap food can undercut farmers when prices fall too low, yet the same support can improve food security by lowering the cost of food for poor consumers in net food-importing developing countries. As Facundo Calvo puts it: ""Lower prices can be good or bad depending on whom you ask: producers or consumers. Remove all agricultural subsidies, and you risk food insecurity, rising poverty, and malnutrition.""

This understanding shifted the debate from eliminating subsidies to repurposing them toward public goods: resilient agriculture, healthier diets, and sustainable production.

""We are entering a promising phase in which reforming domestic public support to better serve nature and livelihoods is open for discussion among farmers, policymakers, and other relevant actors.""

Cristina Larrea, Director, Agriculture, Food, and Sustainability Initiatives

Brazil, for example, is reforming agricultural subsidies to support low carbon practices, regenerative agriculture and reforestation. Malawi is reforming its agricultural input subsidy to scale the use of organic fertilizers. Meanwhile in India, state governments are reforming electricity subsidies for agriculture and the scale up of solar-powered irrigation.

""We are entering a promising phase in which reforming domestic public support to better serve nature and livelihoods is open for discussion among farmers, policymakers, and other relevant actors,"" says Cristina Larrea, IISD's Director of Agriculture, Food and Sustainability Initiatives.

Trend 3: Subsidies as a Green Industrial Policy Tool

The energy sector shows how green industrial policy can drive global market shifts. Germany's early renewable support created demand when solar was still expensive. China then subsidized solar manufacturing at a massive scale—first for export, then at home. Costs collapsed, installations soared, and clean power became competitive.

Tara Laan, IISD's Energy Lead, notes: ""It's been a real positive for the planet—solar is now affordable and available at scale. As electric vehicles and renewables expand,"" she adds, ""subsidies for fossil fuels like gasoline, diesel, and gas are likely to decline over time.""

This model is now being replicated across clean technologies, from batteries and electric vehicles to hydrogen and heat pumps. Governments are increasingly using subsidies not only to correct environmental externalities, but also to build domestic industries, secure supply chains, and capture the economic benefits of the energy transition.

Trend 4: The Rise of Global Subsidy Races

Green industrial policy has accelerated innovation and deployment at a pace that market forces alone were unlikely to deliver—but it has also intensified concerns about subsidy races and trade tensions. A series of shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, recent shifts in the United States' trade policy, and the scale and strategic orientation of Chinese state support to industry, have reinforced another role for subsidies: geopolitical insurance.

Governments are now intervening not only to secure markets, but also to secure supply chains, reduce dependence on foreign manufacturing, and retain value-added production and jobs within their borders. These subsidy races risk deepening global inequities. Countries with large fiscal space can attract investment and shape emerging industries, while poorer economies struggle to keep up. ""Wealthy economies compete with subsidy packages. Those with fewer resources turn to local-content requirements or trade restrictions to develop domestic capacity,"" says Alice Tipping, IISD's Director of Trade and Sustainable Development.

Ivetta Gerasimchuk, IISD's Energy Director, sees this moment as a fundamental reversal in the global subsidy narrative: ""The table has flipped. For years, developing countries were urged to reform subsidies under a neoliberal lens. Today, they’re seeing it’s the rich economies who pump unprecedented subsidies into global markets, while the developing world has been reforming theirs for fiscal pressure reasons.""

Trend 5: Tackling Environmental Challenges through Targeted Global Regulation

Does today’s surge in subsidy competition mean the world has abandoned efforts to discipline them? ""The context is certainly challenging, but not entirely bleak,"" says Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, noting that in the last few years, meaningful steps have been taken to curb inefficient and environmentally harmful subsidies.

The WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies marked a historic breakthrough: the first global rules targeting subsidies that contribute directly to overfishing and overcapacity. The Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability includes rules specifically on fossil fuel subsidies, using a novel way to calculate the balance between fossil fuel subsidies and carbon pricing. Beyond trade, new signals are emerging in public international law. The International Court of Justice recently issued an advisory opinion stating that fossil fuel subsidies may constitute an unlawful act when they undermine states' climate obligations.

Together, these developments suggest that even as subsidy use expands for strategic and industrial goals, the international system is slowly building guardrails to constrain the most damaging forms of government support.

As countries navigate environmental objectives, industrial competitiveness, and fiscal pressures, subsidy reform is increasingly being used as a powerful tool to steer economies toward new models.

What’s Next?

The debate ahead is less about whether subsidies should exist, but how to discipline harmful ones and reform others to serve public goals.

The BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky was originally slated to begin production of advanced lithium-ion batteries this year.
In October 2024, Ford announced a separate battery supply deal with LG Energy Solution for the European market.","Dive Brief:

Korean battery maker SK On says it remains committed to building out a Tennessee plant originally intended to supply electric vehicle batteries to Ford after a joint venture with the car maker was called off, the company said in a statement.

The manufacturer will maintain its strategic partnership with Ford and continue to supply EV batteries for its future vehicles, SK Americas spokesperson Joe Guy Collier said in an email. However, going forward, SK On plans to focus more on “profitable and sustainable growth” in the U.S. by supplying batteries produced in the Tennessee plant to other customers, including for stationary energy storage systems, the company said.

“This agreement allows SK On to strategically realign assets and production capacity to improve its operational efficiency,” the battery maker said in a statement. “It also enables the company to enhance productivity, operational flexibility, and respond more effectively to evolving market dynamics and diverse customer needs.”

Dive Insight:

Ford and SK On reached a mutual agreement to dissolve their electric vehicle battery joint venture, BlueOval SK, Collier confirmed in an email last week.

The joint venture was established in September 2021 as part of a planned $11.4 billion investment by the two companies to build three large-scale manufacturing plants — one in Tennessee and two in Kentucky — to produce advanced batteries for Ford’s future EVs.

Under the terms of the dissolution agreement, each company will independently own and operate the joint venture’s former production facilities, Collier said. A Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the two battery plants in Kentucky, and SK On will assume full ownership and operate the battery plant in Tennessee.

“SK On is committed to the Tennessee plant long-term,” the company said. “We plan to make it a key part of our manufacturing base for advanced batteries in the U.S.”

The dissolution of BlueOval SK is still subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, but it’s expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2026, according to SK On.

BlueOval SK officially broke ground on its battery manufacturing campus in Kentucky in December 2022. In December 2024, the Department of Energy announced the closing of a $9.6 billion direct loan to BlueOval SK. CBT News reported Monday that the DOE would restructure and reduce the loan following the announcement of the joint venture’s end, and that Ford is “cooperating voluntarily to accelerate repayment.”

The funds were earmarked for the construction of the three U.S. plants. The loan was the largest-ever granted by the DOE’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which was designed to increase domestic production of EVs and related components to boost U.S. competitiveness in the global auto market.

Amid declining EV sales and the ending of the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 on Sept. 30, Ford says it does not require the additional battery production capacity it originally anticipated.

The BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky was originally slated to begin production of advanced lithium-ion batteries this year. But Ford announced plans last year to delay its EV launches in order to expand its hybrid vehicle offerings and the planned production start was pushed forward to 2026.

Despite the billions of dollars of investments in electrification, Ford has yet to make a profit selling EVs. The automaker’s Model e EV division lost $5.1 billion in 2024, which followed a loss of $4.7 billion in 2023. The division is still losing money in 2025. In Q1, Ford reported an EBIT loss of $849 million on $1.2 billion in revenue for its Model e division.

Still, Ford announced another $5 billion investment in electrification this summer, including $2 billion to modernize its Louisville, Ky. plant for the production of a new, more affordable electric pickup.

The dissolution of the joint venture also comes after President Donald Trump announced plans last week to rollback Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards put in place by the former Biden Administration that would have required automakers to achieve average fuel economy of 50.4 miles a gallon by 2031.

The plans were announced at a White House event that was attended by Ford CEO Jim Farley, who expressed his support for the plan. The automaker currently counts on the sales of fullsize gas-powered trucks and SUVs for a majority of its profits.

In October 2024, Ford announced a separate battery supply deal with LG Energy Solution for the European market. The terms of the agreement included supplying Ford with an estimated 109 gigawatt hours of batteries for its commercial EVs beginning in 2026. Also as part of the deal, Ford said it would relocate battery production for the electric Mustang Mach-E from LG’s factory in Poland to its U.S. facility in Michigan by this year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/7AuUBh4-oKdB6A12wMq9BwODIWkHevETgiOKvB9hpAg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8xMjAyMjJfRk9SRF9CT1NLX0NlbGVicmF0aW9uXzAxLndlYnA=.webp,N,,2025-12-16 14:00:32.077047

For many of the low-income households we serve, this season doesn’t just mean turning up the heat – it means agonizing choices between paying the power bill or putting food on the table, filling prescriptions, or covering rent.

Duke Energy’s latest proposal to raise rates by 15% over two years threatens to make those choices even harder. Fortunately for struggling customers, Gov. Josh Stein and Attorney General Jeff Jackson have intervened in the case, noting that a bill increase of between $23 to nearly $30 more per month would be a significant hardship on many customers. And these requested rate hikes don’t even factor in the price Duke charges customers for fuel, which is layered on top in separate rate proceedings.

These numbers may not seem large to some, but for families already living paycheck to paycheck, they can be devastating. Every extra dollar spent on electricity is a dollar taken from groceries, medicine, or childcare. And when the temperatures drop, electricity usage rises – meaning the burden is even heavier in the months when families can least afford it.

History shows a significant driver of the cost of electricity is the high cost of gas, a burden Duke Energy lays entirely on its customers. Gas prices are unpredictable and expensive, and subject to global market situations beyond our control. Customers are on the hook to pay for every cent of fuel costs to run Duke’s plants. Duke pays nothing. The imbalance of that dynamic is direly unfair to customers.

There are better, more affordable ways Duke could be meeting energy needs in North Carolina. Solar, for example, is the cheapest way to generate electricity. Costs continue to come down year over year. And, when you pair solar with batteries, it becomes an even more reliable energy resource. Unlike gas, renewables don’t expose families to global market shocks. They provide stable, predictable costs – exactly what North Carolina families need.

Duke Energy should be taking every possible step to lower cost burdens for its customers, not raising rates while planning to invest customer money in expensive gas plants. Families deserve an energy future – and an energy present – that protects them from high bills, not one that locks them into decades of unaffordable costs.

This winter, as families across our state struggle to stay warm, we urge Duke Energy and regulators to remember who pays the price for every decision.

The global solar inverter market is set to contract over the next two years, according to analysis from Wood Mackenzie.

The consultancy is forecasting the market will fall to 577 GWac in 2025, a 2% year-on-year decrease, followed by a further 9% drop to 523 GWac in 2026.

Wood Mackenzie says the downturn follows record shipments in 2024 and reflects market uncertainty across China, Europe and the United States.

China’s solar inverter market is set to decline 5% in 2025 to 304 GWac, representing the first annual decline in 2019. Nevertheless, the country is still expected to maintain its dominance in the global market, accounting for over 2.9 TWac of cumulative inverter demand through to 2034, according to Wood Mackenzie’s forecasts.

European inverter shipments are on track to drop from 88 GWac to 83 GWac this year, before falling beneath 75 GWac annually by 2032 due to reduced utility-scale capture prices and inventory challenges. In the U.S., the inverter market is expected to drop by 22% next year as Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are phased out.

The Southeast Asian market is one region to buck the downward trend, with the solar inverter market growing to 89 GWac this year, supported by domestic manufacturing investments and emerging rooftop PV segments.

Joe Shangraw, research analyst for Wood Mackenzie, says the solar inverter industry is facing “a period of strategic realignment as manufacturers navigate evolving market dynamics and regulatory frameworks.”

“After years of an exponential rise in solar inverter demand, continuous shipment growth is no longer realistic for even the top global inverter manufacturers,” Shangraw continued. “Instead, vendors will need to adapt to new demand drivers to stay competitive: hybrid solar-plus-storage systems, retrofits and repowering, cybersecurity features, 2000-volt architectures and grid services.”

Shangraw added that cybersecurity concerns in the U.S. and European governments over inverter remote-access capabilities are expected to impact the competitive landscape between domestic and foreign manufacturers.

“We expect the two regions to follow different strategies to address cybersecurity concerns,” Shangraw explained. “Europe is expected to expand upon the Cyber Resilience Act by introducing additional software, reporting, and remote-access requirements that could serve as economic or logistical barriers to foreign manufacturers. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers in the US are urging the Department of Commerce to implement restrictions on Chinese inverter imports, adding uncertainty to the roadmap for both foreign and domestic manufacturers.”

By the early 2030s, Wood Mackenzie is projecting the solar inverter market to recover and surpass the 2024 market size with electrification, AI demand growth and a cyclical repowering market set to provide a solid foundation for inverter demand. “Companies that navigate the current challenges while investing in next-generation technologies will emerge stronger when the market recovers in the late 2020s,” Shangraw predicted.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Solar_park_inverter_and_mounts.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:01:46.294042

The automaker has announced it will stop production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, citing profitability challenges in the EV market. At the same time, Ford revealed plans to dissolve its battery joint venture with SK Innovation by the end of Q1 2026, pending regulatory approval. These moves underscore Ford’s strategy to streamline operations and prioritize its wholly owned battery manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and Michigan.

The end of the all-electric F-150 Lightning

The F-150 Lightning, once addressed as a breakthrough in the EV market, has been discontinued. Despite earning praise, including being named the 2023 Truck of the Year by MotorTrend and featuring Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) capabilities, the Lightning fell short of expectations. It became a financial drain for Ford due to its high production costs. Originally priced at $40,000, the truck’s price soon rose to $ 55,000 for the 2025 model, discouraging many potential buyers.

Andrew Frick, president of Ford Blue and Ford Model e, explained during a call with reporters, “The American consumer is speaking clearly. They want the benefits of electrification like instant torque and mobile power, but they also demand affordability. Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas.”

Launching a battery energy storage system business

One of the most significant aspects of the announced Ford’s new strategy is its entry into the battery energy storage (BESS) market. The company plans to repurpose its battery manufacturing facilities in Glendale, Kentucky, to produce advanced BESS solutions, investing roughly $2 billion over the next two years to scale the business. These systems, designed for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial applications, will leverage Ford’s battery technology expertise to meet growing demand for BESS in the US.

By focusing on its wholly owned battery manufacturing facilities and advancing its expertise in battery energy storage systems (BESS), Ford is positioning itself as a formidable new entrant in the rapidly growing BESS sector and a potential competitor to Tesla Energy with its recent announcement. Ford’s entry into the market introduces a new dynamic, potentially intensifying competition and driving further innovation in the sector

According to the announcement, Ford aims to bring 20 GWh of annual capacity online by 2027, with initial production expected within 18 months. The Kentucky facility will manufacture LFP prismatic cells, battery modules, and 20-foot DC container systems, positioning Ford as a key player in the energy storage market. This move not only diversifies Ford’s revenue streams but also aligns with the increasing need for sustainable energy solutions.

Expanding hybrid and affordable EV options

In addition to its new energy storage business, Ford is doubling down on hybrid vehicles and affordable EVs. By 2030, the company expects hybrids, extended-range EVs, and fully EVs to account for 50% of its global volume, up from 17% today. This shift is driven by customer demand for vehicles that balance electrification with practicality and affordability.

Ford also stated that it will expand its hybrid lineup and focus on affordability, mirroring Toyota’s long-standing strategy of prioritizing hybrids and diverse powertrain options. While Toyota has consistently championed hybrids as a cornerstone of its electrification strategy, it has recently doubled down on hybrid investments in the US to boost innovation and sustainability and create hundreds of new jobs. Ford is now adopting a similar path. Ford’s pivot includes developing a Universal EV Platform for smaller, cost-effective electric models and expanding its hybrid lineup, aligning with Toyota’s philosophy of balancing electrification with practicality and customer demand.

Ford’s new Universal EV Platform will underpin a range of smaller, cost-effective electric models, starting with a midsize pickup truck to be assembled at the Louisville Assembly Plant in 2027. The next-generation F-150 Lightning will transition to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture, combining the benefits of electric power with the reliability of a gasoline generator. This hybrid approach addresses the limitations of the all-electric Lightning, offering an estimated 700+ mile range and enhanced towing capabilities.

Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer, emphasized the importance of this evolution: “The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series. Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love — 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration — and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive.”

Reinforcing American manufacturing

The company plans to hire thousands of new employees across the US and invest in its facilities in Tennessee and Ohio. The Tennessee Truck Plant, formerly the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center, will produce new gas-powered trucks starting in 2029, while the Ohio Assembly Plant will focus on gas and hybrid commercial vans.

Ford’s evolved strategy prioritizes customer needs, affordability, and profitability. By expanding its hybrid lineup, developing a low-cost EV platform, and entering the energy storage market, Ford is positioning itself for long-term success. While the all-electric F-150 Lightning may no longer be part of Ford’s lineup, its legacy as a technological innovation remains, showcasing the potential of electrification in the truck segment. Ford’s shift to BESS marks a bold step toward addressing the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions in the US, particularly for data centers and infrastructure.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt164d06c6aba93641/65143345946cdee2b7fde852/F-150_20Lightning_Platinum_on-road_02.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-16 13:01:17.431858

The order consolidated existing proceedings, including a technical conference convened on November 1, 2024 to discuss generic issues related to the co-location of large loads at generating facilities and a complaint filed in November 22, 2024 by Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation) against PJM. Collectively, the Commission combined the formal records of those proceedings in issuing the show cause order so as to focus primarily on existing provisions in the PJM OATT and a PJM Guidance Document issued on March 22, 2024. As the Guidance Document furnished procedures and best practices for co-located large loads in PJM, but did not formalize all of those rules in the PJM OATT, Constellation alleged in its complaint that certain utilities within the PJM footprint had exploited the lack of formal requirements in blocking co-located generating units. For additional context on co-location in PJM, please refer to our article: FERC Orders Review of Co-Located Generation for Data Centers in PJM.

The show cause order solicited comments from stakeholders and industry participants regarding potential revisions to the PJM OATT if the Commission ultimately determined that it had been unjust and unreasonable. Namely, the Commission sought to spur discussion with respect to: jurisdictional issues (in the context of co-location, states determine which entities are legally permitted to provide electricity to retail customers in co-location arrangements); OATT provisions (the lack of applicable provisions may have resulted in undue discrimination or preferential treatment, particularly relating to co-located generating units arranging for wholesale transmission or retail distribution service); and reliability and resource adequacy (potential impacts if co-located generation is not accounted for by grid operators). A number of other issues were raised in the show cause order, such that the Commission is compelled under section 206 of the FPA to ensure maximum protection to customers and ratepayers under its jurisdiction in the circumstance that a refund is mandated.

During the ensuing comment period, a significant number of parties filed responses, answers, and reply comments to the show cause order. On March 24, 2025, the Indicated PJM Transmission Owners (the above-captioned entities listed for Docket No. EL25-49-001) submitted an answer indicating support for the Commission determination that the existing PJM OATT is just and reasonable and that co-located end-use large loads should be treated as load in front of the meter and designated in PJM as Network Load. Specifically, the Indicated PJM Transmission Owners asserted that the existing forms of transmission service in the PJM OATT (Network Integration Transmission Service and Point-to-Point Transmission Service) sufficiently apply to co-location arrangements. The Indicated PJM Transmission Owners also supported procedures by which large loads would be ""appropriately studied, charged, and factored in operationally"" by PJM and transmission owners. As such, the Indicated PJM Transmission Owners stated that, as ""beneficiaries of the transmission system,"" large loads and data centers should pay their share to avoid undue cost shifting to other ratepayers. The Indicated PJM Transmission Owners also emphasized that even ""isolated"" data centers may utilize grid services including frequency regulation, voltage support, and backup power.

For its part as the regional grid operator, PJM filed an answer on March 24, 2025, arguing that most co-location arrangements in its market should be treated as Network Load. PJM also stated that certain state laws within its footprint may grant local utilities retail franchise rights, which would preclude generating units from selling energy directly to a co-located large load regardless of wholesale rules under jurisdiction of the Commission.

Constellation, and other independent power producers, contended that the current provisions within the PJM OATT are tantamount to barriers to entry for co-located large loads. In its answer, Constellation stated that if a load is fully and physically disconnected from the grid, it does not utilize services provided by the incumbent transmission system and therefore should not subject to transmission charges.

Companies such as Amazon and Google (commonly known as hyperscalers by utilizing data centers for artificial intelligence) filed respective answers that co-location is often a bridge solution until regulatory certainty around interconnection timing and processes is improved. The companies generally offered a willingness to pay for transmission services, but conditioned it on the premise that ""unused"" transmission capacity should not be included in such allocations. Google proposed a commitment-backed requirement (that would align with recent efforts to streamline and expedite the interconnection queue), whereby only financially viable projects could enter the interconnection queue study process in order to filter out speculative requests.

And, from a technical perspective, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) filed comments on April 23, 2025, largely echoing its refrain over the past year by highlighting the risks posed to reliability of the bulk power system. NERC specifically stated that, if a data center trips offline without warning, the respective system operators may not have imposed specific visibility and modeling standards necessary to respond accordingly in order to avoid a cascading disruption of grid services. Notably, NERC found that nuclear generation is well-suited for co-located large loads, given ""its inherent high-capacity factor, load-carrying ability, and steady performance even in extreme weather conditions."" NERC also reiterated that incidents caused by large loads have occurred and that new risks (including cybersecurity) may not be fully understood or accounted for in regulatory language. For additional context on NERC's efforts to identify reliability impacts of data centers, please refer to our article: NERC tees up plan to assess grid risks associated with data centers.

Note: The show cause proceeding was initiated prior to a recent directive issued by the Department of Energy (DOE) on October 23, 2025, where DOE instructed the Commission to expand its jurisdiction over interstate transmission in order to ""rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads."" DOE furnished an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR); subsequently, the Commission will undertake a rulemaking proceeding to evaluate this issue from a broader standpoint than exclusively in PJM. For additional context on the ANOPR, please refer to our article: DOE directs FERC to accelerate interconnection of data centers.

On November 21, 2025, Constellation filed a motion for expedited action, citing the ""best path forward"" to effectuate the necessary revisions to the PJM OATT in parallel with a potential comprehensive rule pursuant to the ANOPR. Constellation requested that the Commission issue a full replacement rate in the show cause proceeding, and, if not, issue an initial and targeted ruling that would clarify jurisdictional boundaries and require non-discriminatory cooperation by PJM transmission owners in large load and co-location study processes. In the motion, Constellation also referred to the proposed timeline of the show cause proceeding, stating that the Commission had intended to issue an order with 180 days (i.e., late June 2025) and had not yet done so. On December 5, 2025, PJM filed an answer to the Constellation motion, contending that Constellation sought to improperly preempt the ANOPR as well as PJM stakeholder initiatives led by its Board of Managers (namely, its Critical Issue Fast Path process). Accordingly, PJM stated that ""the Commission should be cognizant that a set of rules or guidelines that are applicable only to the PJM market will not create a rational, durable, and predictable pathway for the national issues associated with large load interconnection."" Certain other parties, including the Indicated PJM Transmission Owners, filed comments expressing that the Constellation motion should be denied.

Agenda item E-1 may be an order on the consolidated proceedings with respect to co-location in PJM.

E-2 – Daylight II, LLC (Docket No. ER26-173-000); Daylight II-A, LLC (Docket No. ER26-174-000); Daylight III, LLC (Docket No. ER26-175-000); EdSan MV Holding Company C, LLC (Docket No. ER26-176-000). On October 15, 2025, Daylight I, LLC, Daylight II, LLC, Daylight III, LLC, and EdSan MV Holding Company C, LLC (collectively, the Gen-Tie Entities) filed separate applications, pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), seeking Commission authorization to issue securities and assume liabilities. In the respective applications, the Gen-Tie Entities asserted that they are ""interconnection-only"" entities, as their transmission facilities consist solely of the generator interconnection facilities necessary to connect their respective renewable energy projects to the grid. The applications argued that, because the Gen-Tie Entities do not serve captive customers and their transmission assets are limited to these interconnection functions, the proposed securities issuances are consistent with the public interest and will not impair their ability to perform service as public utilities. Agenda item E-2 may be an order on the applications.

E-3 – GenOn Energy Management, LLC (Docket No. ER11-2508-028); Blossburg Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1865-002); Brunot Island Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2142-003); Chalk Point Power, LLC (Docket No. ER21-573-003); Chalk Point Steam, LLC (Docket No. ER20-1887-002); Dickerson Power, LLC (Docket No. ER21-574-003); GenOn Bowline, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1411-002); GenOn California South, LP (Docket No. ER19-1415-004); GenOn Power Midwest, LP (Docket No. ER19-1417-003); GenOn REMA, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1414-004); Gilbert Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2143-003); Hamilton Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1866-002); Heritage Power Marketing, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2148-004); Hunterstown Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1867-002); Lanyard Power Holdings, LLC (Docket No. ER21-568-001); Lanyard Power Marketing, LLC (Docket No. ER21-575-003); Lanyard Power Holdings, LLC (Docket No. ER21-568-001); Lanyard Power Marketing, LLC (Docket No. ER21-575-003); Morgantown Power, LLC (Docket No. ER21-577-003); Morgantown Station, LLC (Docket No. ER21-578-003); Mountain Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2147-003); New Castle Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2141-003); Niles Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1868-002); Orrtanna Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1869-002); Portland Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2145-003); Sayreville Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2144-003); Shawnee Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1870-002); Shawville Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2140-003); Titus Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1871-002); Tolna Power, LLC (Docket No. ER19-1872-002); Warren Generation, LLC (Docket No. ER19-2146-003). On June 29, 2023, the above-captioned entities (collectively, the GenOn Northeast MBR Sellers) submitted the triennial market power analysis for the Northeast region, pursuant to section 35.37 of the Commission's regulations. The triennial demonstrated that GenOn Northeast MBR Sellers continue to meet the criteria for market-based rate authority by showing that the respective entities do not possess horizontal or vertical market power. On August 28, 2023, the Independent Market Monitor for PJM (IMM) filed comments, arguing that the Commission should condition the GenOn Northeast MBR Sellers' market-based rate authority on specific market power mitigation measures, asserting that the PJM market is not structurally competitive. On September 12, 2023, the GenOn Northeast MBR Sellers filed reply comments, arguing that the IMM's protests constitute a collateral attack on the Commission-approved PJM market design and are outside the scope of the triennial review proceeding. Agenda item E-3 may be an order on the market power analysis.

E-4 – Ratts 2 Solar LLC (Docket No. ER26-427-000). On November 4, 2025, Ratts 2 Solar LLC (Ratts 2 Solar) filed a request for a limited and prospective waiver of certain provisions of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) Open Access Transmission, Energy and Operating Reserve Markets Tariff. Specifically, Ratts 2 Solar sought a waiver of the MISO Generator Interconnection Procedures to extend its Commercial Operation Date and prevent the termination of its Generator Interconnection Agreement. In support of the waiver, Ratts 2 Solar cited unforeseen development delays beyond its control, including supply chain disruptions affecting equipment procurement and challenges in finalizing off-take arrangements, which have hindered the project's ability to meet its original milestones. On November 21, 2025, the Commission issued an errata notice correcting the comment deadline for the proceeding to November 28, 2025. Agenda item E-4 may be an order on the waiver request.

E-5 – Sierra Club; Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.; and Sustainable FERC Project v. Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (Docket No. EL24-96-000). On April 1, 2024, the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sustainable FERC Project (collectively, the Public Interest Organizations) filed a complaint, pursuant to section 206 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), against Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP). The complaint alleged that SPP's existing capacity accreditation methodologies were unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory because they overvalued thermal resources while undervaluing renewable resources. Specifically, the Public Interest Organizations argued that SPP's current rules failed to account for correlated outages of thermal generators during extreme weather events (such as Winter Storm Uri) and did not adequately reflect the risk of fuel supply failures. On May 13, 2024, SPP filed an answer rejecting these claims, contending that the complaint was unnecessary and duplicative because SPP had already submitted a section 205 filing in order to reform its accreditation methodology which addressed the reliability concerns. SPP also asserted that the Public Interest Organizations failed to meet their burden under section 206 and that the pending section 205 proceeding was the appropriate venue to adjudicate the proposed changes. Most recently, on October 28, 2024, the Public Interest Organizations filed a motion to consolidate this docket with SPP's ongoing section 205 filings regarding resource accreditation. These related proceedings include the request filed by SPP on February 23, 2024 to implement Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) methodologies for renewable resources and Performance-Based Accreditation (PBA) for thermal resources, as well as a September 3, 2024 filing proposing fuel assurance enhancements to the thermal accreditation methodology. Agenda item E-5 may be an order on the complaint.

E-6 – Idaho Power Company (Docket Nos. ER10-2126-008, ER10-2126-009, EL24-62-000, EL25-14-000). On December 21, 2023, Idaho Power Company (Idaho Power) submitted an updated market power analysis for the Northwest region, pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and section 35.37 of the Commission's regulations. The filing served to demonstrate that Idaho Power continued to meet the Commission's criteria for market-based rate authority. In the analysis, Idaho Power asserted that it passed the pivotal supplier and wholesale market share screens. However, on February 27, 2024, the Commission instituted a proceeding under section 206 of the Federal Power Act to investigate whether Idaho Power's market-based rates remained just and reasonable, following an initial review suggesting Idaho Power may have failed the indicative screens in the balancing authority areas of Idaho Power, Avista, PacifiCorp-East, and PacifiCorp-West. On April 25, 2024, Idaho Power filed a response to the show cause order, submitting a revised market power analysis and arguing that the screen failures were due to unique characteristics of the hydro-dominated Northwest market and available transmission capacity that was not fully accounted for. Subsequently, on September 30, 2024, Idaho Power submitted a Change in Status filing reporting the acquisition of new generation resources. On October 15, 2025, Idaho Power filed a settlement agreement or mitigation proposal intended to resolve the market power concerns raised in the section 206 investigation. The proposal includes provisions for cost-based mitigation or the voluntary surrender of market-based rate authority in certain balancing authority areas. Agenda item E-6 may be an order on the market power analysis, the section 206 investigation, and the settlement agreement.

C-5 – Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Docket No. CP25-60-000). On February 28, 2025, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) filed an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) in order to construct and operate the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project. The project would involve the construction of approximately 55 miles of pipeline looping and modifications to existing compressor stations across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, designed to provide approximately 1.6 million Dth/d of incremental firm transportation service. Following the application, Commission staff issued multiple environmental information requests to Transco in May and July 2025 to address data gaps regarding water resources and threatened species. On October 3, 2025, Commission staff issued an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project, concluding that approval would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, provided Transco adheres to specific mitigation measures.

“North Carolina’s national forests are full of natural wonders that support local economies and are sources of immense pride for nearby communities.

That win prompted the Center for Biological Diversity, Southern Environmental Law Center and MountainTrue on Dec. 15 to voluntarily dismiss their lawsuit challenging the logging operation.

The groups sued last month to halt the logging, and days later the U.S. Forest Service cancelled the logging and the logging equipment was withdrawn.

“One of the country’s wildest gorges was spared additional harm because local communities spoke up. They saved an exceptional forest, imperiled wildlife, and a world-class river,” said Will Harlan, Southeast director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Unfortunately, wild places will continue to be targeted by this administration, so we’ll keep standing shoulder to shoulder with communities to protect our beloved forests and rivers.”

The Service described the logging as intended to remove storm debris, but much of the project area is healthy, intact forest. When conservation groups asked the agency to limit logging to portions of the area with storm damage, the agency refused, prompting the lawsuit.

Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, the Service stopped the logging operation and equipment was removed from the site. Fewer than 20 acres were logged on the 120-acre tract, and logging stopped before it harmed the healthy, intact portion. The conservation groups voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit on Monday, after the agency canceled the contract.

“North Carolina’s national forests are full of natural wonders that support local economies and are sources of immense pride for nearby communities. Public notice, transparency, and accountability are the absolute bare minimum of what the Forest Service owes our communities before it opens these forests for logging,” said Sam Evans, leader of SELC’s national forests and parks program. “As long as the Forest Service refuses to do even that bare minimum, we are going to continue to haul them into court.”

The logging project ignored the agency’s own Nantahala-Pisgah Forest Plan, which directs the Service to manage the area as undeveloped backcountry and a reserve for old-growth forests. The project area, designated as a North Carolina Natural Heritage Natural Area, is home to rare plants and sits on steep slopes above the Nolichucky River — a world-famous whitewater rafting destination. Logging in this area threatened to leave permanent scars on the landscape, pollute the Nolichucky River and imperil the area’s incredible backcountry qualities.

However, even the small area logged will leave long-lasting scars as roads were bulldozed from the riverbanks into the backcountry. The agency has presented to plans to fix these roads.

“Unfortunately, it seems like this hide-the-ball strategy is becoming more and more common with the Forest Service, leaving the public and nearby communities in the dark about what is happening on our incredible shared public lands,” said Josh Kelly, resilient forests program director at MountainTrue. “We encourage folks to keep an eye out and to reach out to local conservation organizations if you see something concerning.”",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:01:54.093022

The Department of the Treasury is looking at a January release of guidance for the foreign-entity-of-concern rules that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act imposed on the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Y, 45X and 48E clean energy tax credits, strategy firm Capstone said in a Monday policy analysis.

The firm said it believes the guidance “is likely to be taxpayer-friendly rather than punitive, benefiting manufacturers such as First Solar Inc. and Enphase Energy Inc,” and it will address “the most uncertain aspects” of the FEOC rules, like material assistance, payment restrictions and effective control.

“We expect the Internal Revenue Service to prioritize administrability and, therefore, not require taxpayers to vet every level of their supply chain,” Capstone said. “After the release of sub-regulatory guidance, we expect industry advocates to push the administration to adopt favorable final rules.”

Companies are already preparing for the release of that guidance by seeking divestitures, mapping supply chains, renegotiating contracts and utilizing safe harbor tables along with supplier certifications, according to an analysis released last week by Crux, a finance technology company that connects tax credit buyers and sellers.

The industry is “not waiting for guidance,” Crux’s report said. More than 90% of the 50 clean energy developers and manufacturers the report authors surveyed “have already initiated ownership reviews, contract audits, and supply chain mapping.”

“This proactive stance indicates that many companies intend to begin 2026 with preparation well underway, even as regulatory clarity remains incomplete,” the report said.

Around 8% of the surveyed companies reported that specified foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity owners are allowed to appoint directors or officers, and those companies reported taking a “variety of mitigation measures,” including liquidating ownership.

Around 80% of companies that reported having effective control payments to prohibited foreign entities in certain contracts said they are revising contract terms to exclude those payments, Crux said.

Crux said that only 38% of the firms surveyed describe themselves as “fully prepared” for 2026, “but most have started building frameworks for compliance” even as they wait for formal guidance from the Treasury Department.

“Treasury is likely to open a formal rulemaking process for FEOC in Q2 2026, offering an opportunity for stakeholder input,” Capstone said. “Treasury will likely take an approach similar to that used for the revised beginning of construction (BOC) rules for wind and solar tax credits, prioritizing administrability over setting anti-China or anti-renewables policy via rulemaking.”

Capstone said it’s “likely” that the Treasury Department aims to release final rules by the end of next year, “but we believe that timeline is ambitious given Biden-era precedent.” The analysis noted that the Biden administration took 20 months to finalize its 30D FEOC guidance after the passage of the IRA.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JSBqGjDyQ6Mm0A3w7pYfS9RUWM9_Xp6jDpp4dM_aDi4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DaGluZXNlX3NvbGFyX21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcl8uanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-16 12:01:45.760806

Jimmy Pang has spent the past few months trying to map out a long-term plan to keep his health care while growing his physical therapy practice in San Diego.

It’s a conundrum millions of small business owners and self-employed Americans are now facing. Health care through the federal Affordable Care Act is getting more expensive, and the tax credits that helped make it affordable will shrink or disappear in 2026. The change comes after a Republican-led Congress refused to extend the enhanced credits despite pleas from voters and a sustained push from Democrats that shuttered the government.

“I have chronic health issues, and I am very dependent on my health insurance,” said Pang, who suffers from chronic headaches and pain. “I’m seen by multiple specialists. That is the biggest thing for me.”

Pang pays about $350 a month for his plan through the federal health care exchange, and a $350 subsidy pays for the rest. Next year, he estimates he’ll pay $750 a month and may qualify only for a $50 subsidy because he moved his therapy practice from the Bay Area to San Diego to be close to his family. He expects 2027 to be even worse, with no subsidy and monthly costs of around $800 or more.

Covered California estimates that on average, consumers will see a 97% increase in premiums in 2026 without the enhanced tax credits. The state expects to lose $2.5 billion in enhanced premium tax credits, the state exchange reported.

The changes will be especially tough for the millions of small business owners and self-employed workers across the U.S. They are three times more likely than others to rely on the health care exchange for their own care, according to the Treasury Department.

If lawmakers do nothing by Dec. 31, the consequences will ripple through communities and we all stand to lose. Small business owners are the country’s biggest job creators and power local economies. They preserve neighborhood culture, prepare our food, care for our children, create entertainment and build community. Yet, they now face choosing between health care and their livelihoods.

THE ENHANCED PREMIUM TAX CREDITS for middle- to higher-income earners were created in 2021 during the pandemic as part of the American Rescue Plan Act and extended the following year through the Inflation Reduction Act. President Joe Biden signed both laws, which had been unanimously rejected by Republicans in Congress.

The enhanced premium credits were intended to help people who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level—$62,600 for an individual and $128,600 for a family of four. For small business owners and gig-economy workers, the credits were a lifeline.

The effort worked. Enrollment surged. Uninsured rates dropped. Entrepreneurs finally had a foothold in a system that often overlooked them.

Roughly 4.2 million small business owners and self-employed workers received their health coverage through the ACA in 2023—up from 3.3 million the year before, federal Treasury Department data shows. In 2025, the number of self-employed or small business enrollees is expected to reach 5 million, with nearly half a million in California alone, found the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive-leaning think tank.

The surge was powered almost entirely by affordability. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 93% of marketplace enrollees rely on premium tax credits.

Now, among overall participants, the Congressional Budget Office predicts 4.2 million people will become uninsured by 2034 once those enhanced credits disappear. But the number could be even higher and happen more quickly—4.8 million by 2026, the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated in a September report.

Not everyone is losing subsidies, but nearly all enrollees on the exchange face massive price hikes, and those two factors will drive people out of the program, according to experts.

The Urban Institute projects that those who earn the least will see the largest increases. Average net premiums for individuals or families earning below 250% of the federal poverty level—or $39,125 for an individual and $80,375 for a family of four—are projected to quadruple in 2026 compared to what they are this year.

“This is a major hit,” said Matthew Buettgens, senior fellow at the Urban Institute and co-author of the September report. “For someone at a higher income, the premium may seem small. But to someone at the lower end, even paying anything at all could be very difficult.”

FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, the exchange may be their only choice for health care. Most have too few employees to negotiate group plans and don’t earn enough to make private insurance affordable without assistance.

Small businesses owned by people of color are especially vulnerable, research shows. They are less likely to have access to group plans and are more likely to rely on the exchange.

“A lot of people try to run a business, and they are on high-deductible plans because they are healthy, but everyone is one second away from an accident,” said Pang. “I can’t imagine what restaurants, coffee shops and others are going to do. All of their costs are going up as well and now they have this on top.”

Pang also worries about losing protections for preexisting conditions.

“If that happened, I’d be pretty screwed,” Pang said. “I don’t have a life-threatening condition but I have serious conditions.”

In California, new preliminary estimates show that 280,000 people are expected to drop off Covered California once the enhanced premium subsidies expire, said Dylan Roby, faculty associate at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and professor at UC Irvine’s School of Population & Public Health. Of those, about 80,000 may find other coverage and the rest are likely to go uninsured. Roby said the figures are part of “preliminary unpublished estimates” that he is working on with UCLA and UC Berkeley.

While not everyone is losing their credits, the expiration of the enhanced credits for higher earners is rippling through the marketplace and spiking prices even for enrollees who will not lose subsidies. Insurance actuaries priced 2026 coverage higher based on expectations that healthier and younger people will leave the exchange once subsidies disappear.

“If subsidies had been extended,” Roby said, “premiums could have been about 20% lower.”

IN LOS ANGELES, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION EDITOR David Dennick has talked to three insurance brokers and spent hours comparing plans, poring over documents and estimating his budget for his family of four knowing that they will lose the $850 enhanced subsidy they have relied on for years.

Staying on the same Blue Shield of California plan, through Covered California, would push their premiums from $1,389 to $2,478 a month. Switching to a lesser HealthNet plan will still cost them $1,837, nearly $500 more than today—and that’s before higher deductibles and fees.

Navigating expensive health care isn’t a new experience for Dennick, but it’s frustrating to be in this position again.

Dennick and his wife, a marriage and family therapist, have been buying their own coverage for decades. Before the Affordable Care Act, it was expensive and one year they were denied coverage due to a false “preexisting condition” notation based on a random abnormal test many years prior.

The passage of Obamacare in 2010 changed that. For a time, it made care accessible and affordable, especially when the enhanced premium tax credits began four years ago.

But without the enhanced premium credit, they will again be paying far more than they can comfortably afford. Dennick says the math is keeping him up at night.

“We can’t afford it and can’t afford not to have it,” Dennick said. “We could potentially lose everything we have worked our whole lives for because of unrealistic health insurance.”

With inflation, an unstable entertainment industry and rising costs everywhere, Dennick says it feels like pressure from all sides.

“It feels crushing. I feel like we are just basically trying to stay afloat,” he said. “With inflation and everything it’s so much tougher to feel like the future is bright.”

During the 43-day government shutdown that ultimately ended with Democrats giving in without securing protection for health care prices or credits, Dennick was so outraged that he wrote letters to both California senators, Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla. He implored them to fight to keep the enhanced credits. He got a standard letter in response.

On Thursday, the U.S. Senate blocked an effort by Democrats to extend the expiring subsidies, essentially killing any hope for a last-minute save.

IN WEST HOLLYWOOD, ALISON GORDON, known professionally as the “Insurance Mom,” manages about 2,000 clients. Many of them, she says, are facing the loss of the enhanced premium subsidy and don’t want to switch plans or lose their doctors. There are two paths she’s seeing her clients following. Families and people with chronic conditions are scrambling to keep the same or lesser coverage even if it costs more. And younger, healthier people are weighing whether to drop out entirely.

Gordon said there has been confusion over which subsidies are going away. She is reassuring some clients about the program and helping others consider their options. She encourages consumers to talk to a broker, like Dennick did.

“Covered California is too easy to navigate incorrectly. People need help right now,” she said.

Even for those who remain insured, access remains a challenge. Many Californians with coverage still face long waits for specialists, inadequate provider networks, increased deductibles and unpredictable out-of-pocket costs.

Dennick was billed $2,000 for his son’s 15-minute emergency room visit this year where a doctor examined his son’s throat and gave him antinausea medication. Dennick and his wife spent hours contesting the inflated bill and it was eventually lowered.

They’re not alone. It’s a sad indictment of our health care system that so many Californians have to make similar calls to decipher and contest expensive bills, and that small business owners who power our local economies have to stress about when and how to go to the doctor.

The solutions are straightforward. Congress could restore or extend the enhanced tax credits. States like California could offer supplemental subsidies, as they’ve done before—though mainly for very low-income families.

But the overarching problem, that health care premiums are becoming out of reach for most Americans, will require more investigation—and action—by state and federal officials to fix.",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Cap-and-Main-121625.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-16 12:01:49.704401

EWG doubts Zeldin’s MAHA plan will be any different. It’ll probably end up like the Trump administration’s first-term Infrastructure Week – ambitious plans promised, never delivered.

So, Administrator Zeldin, let’s save you some homework. Just adopt EWG’s MAAHA plan, below. You already have the authority to implement the steps we’re recommending. And if you’re serious about safeguarding the environment and public health, this is the way.

It’s time to restore science, enforce the law and make the agency a true defender of communities – not an enabler of industry.

You’re welcome.

1. Rebuild EPA staff and expertise

Real MAAHA action: Stop incentivizing mass resignations and halt hiring freezes, and bring back highly trained scientists, enforcement attorneys and technical staff.

Under Zeldin’s direction, the EPA has pursued a double threat of weakening public health protections. First, it has slashed the jobs of thousands of critical personnel(link is external). Second, it is dismantling core science and enforcement programs, including eliminating the vital Office of Research and Development(link is external), or ORD.

That office “is the heart and brain of the EPA,” said Justin Chen(link is external), president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a union representing thousands of EPA employees.

“Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts upon human health and the environment,” added Chen. “Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.”

2. Stop gutting science and reinstate research and evidence‑based decision‑making

Real MAAHA action: Reverse the shutdown of the EPA’s premier air pollution human research lab(link is external) and restore the ORD.

Experts warn that closing the lab impairs the very scientific foundation needed to protect kids from dangerous air pollution – yet MAHA claims to champion children.

“It was one of the only places in the country where you could put humans in a chamber and measure their reaction to ozone,” said Laura Kate Bender(link is external), vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association.

“Those studies have long informed our understanding of how much of these pollutants are safe to breathe,” she added.

3. Reinstate and strengthen chemical safety standards

Real MAAHA action: Cancel the absurd industry‑friendly formaldehyde risk assessment that raises acceptable exposure levels of the known carcinogen. Reverse proposed changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act that would expose people to additional harmful chemicals.

Instead, use the best available science to protect people from cancer-causing substances that come from multiple sources of exposure and that are often present in mixtures.

Zeldin’s EPA favors methods and advice from top agency officials he plucked from the chemical industry(link is external), enlisting their help to weaken chemical safety standards.

4. Reverse toxic pesticide approvals and protect farmworkers, kids and consumers

Real MAAHA action: Reverse the EPA’s fast‑track approvals and extended uses for several toxic agricultural chemicals, including PFAS pesticides and dicamba(link is external). Implement strict health-protective drift and residue limits and truly phase out the worst crop chemicals.

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump and top MAHA figures like Kennedy promised real protection from pesticide exposure. But under Zeldin, the agency is accelerating pesticide approvals while ignoring mounting evidence of health harms.

5. Protect drinking water

Real MAAHA action: Enforce the Biden EPA’s 2024 binding drinking water standards, known as maximum contaminant levels, for the most notorious PFAS. An estimated 41 million people will be drinking PFAS contaminated water for two more years because of the EPA’s delayed implementation of the new standards.

Stop delaying or softening enforcement of the standards for corporations that dump those chemicals into our drinking water supply.

Zeldin is planning to roll back or weaken(link is external) those health-protective legal limits for highly toxic PFAS contaminants in drinking water.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” said Erik Olson(link is external), senior strategic advisor for health and environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

6. Clean up the air – not just talk about It

Real MAAHA action: Keep and strengthen air pollution limits on smog, fine particulate matter(link is external), and mercury from coal-fired power plants(link is external), avoid delayed enforcement of vehicle tailpipe pollution standards(link is external) and reverse attempts to weaken the EPA finding(link is external) that climate pollutants endanger public health and welfare.

Delaying clean-air rules and undermining their scientific foundation risks an increase in air pollution, leading to more asthma, heart attacks and premature deaths.

“The result will be more toxic chemicals, more cancers, more asthma attacks and more dangers for pregnant women and their children. Rather than helping our economy, it will create chaos,” said Amanda Leland(link is external), executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund.

7. Restore and expand grants for community health and environmental justice

Real MAAHA action: Re‑establish EPA environmental justice(link is external), community science and public health grants cancelled by Zeldin.

These cuts undermine local efforts to reduce pollution exposure in underserved and overburdened communities, not to mention likely violating federal court orders in terminating the congressionally approved funds.

“The illegal termination of these EPA grants not only violates congressional appropriations law, contractual agreements, and multiple court orders, but it also undermines essential programs aimed at eliminating childhood lead poisoning, reducing toxic air pollution, and mitigating health risks from heat and wildfires,” said Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse(link is external), the top Democrat on the environment committee.

8. Protect polluter enforcement – rather than undermine It

Real MAAHA action: Work with the Department of Justice to reinstate vigorous enforcement that holds polluters accountable

Under Zeldin, the EPA’s enforcement of laws designed to stop companies from releasing dangerous chemicals into communities has grown remarkably weak(link is external). Zeldin must reverse course, restore strong oversight and ensure polluters face real consequences for putting public health at risk.

“The future is grim for environmental protection,” said Gary Jones, a former top EPA enforcement attorney who now is the executive director of the nonprofit CREEDemocracy(link is external), which promotes renewable energy and democracy globally.

“The risk will be most felt in overburdened communities, but this will hurt red and blue districts alike. If the EPA cop is not on the beat, then people are going to be harmed,” he said.

9. Actually deliver on MAHA promises

Real MAAHA action: Put public health first by taking health-protective actions in an effort to cut cancer rates; cleaning up our air and water and dramatically reducing people’s exposure to toxic chemicals and pesticides.

MAHA was sold as a health-first agenda. But under Zeldin, the EPA mirrors the priorities of polluters who treat toxic emissions as a business cost rather than a public health threat.

Enough with the nonsense.

A true MAHA agenda puts people above profits, science above spin and public health far ahead of polluter priorities. Anything less than fully reversing Zeldin’s rollbacks, restoring EPA expertise and enforcing laws that protect communities from pollution is a sham.

Your favorite agency, the EPA

The actions outlined above are just the first steps the EPA should take to better protect public health and the environment. There are many other things that the agency can and should do to make all Americans healthier.

But, Administrator Zeldin, the MAAHA agenda is a good start.",https://www.ewg.org/themes/custom/ewg/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-16 12:01:31.343160

Not broadband, not electric transmission lines, not even nuclear power plants. While red tape is not always the sole cause, it has become a common and significant contributor to our national gridlock.

Decades-old laws governing energy permitting and environmental protection, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Water Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act, were no doubt crafted with noble intent. But today, they not only fail to truly protect the environment; even worse, they’ve become a potent mechanism to delay and kill development of all kinds.

Most permitting reform conversations focus on the energy sector – and NEPA receives the most attention of all, with good reason. The law was conceived as a kind of environmental speedbump, ensuring that developers and agencies “look before they leap.” But even NEPA was not intended to effectively mandate the multi-year approval process of today. The average completion timeline for an Environmental Impact Statement, the most onerous form of NEPA review, is now 4.5 years. Indeed, even NEPA’s legislative author, Sen. Henry “Scoop” Jackson, argued that agencies and courts had “vastly inflat[ed] the requirements of the Environmental Impact Statement” (though he argued the benefits of the law outweighed these costs, perhaps a debatable assertion in the late 20th century but certainly off target today).",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/d8lrla4f/staging/fb603be2ed34e3b8e419d20fbb9e08071885c621-3840x1920.png,N,,2025-12-16 12:00:47.949479

BASE SHELF PROSPECTUS IS ACCESSIBLE, AND THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE WITHIN TWO BUSINESS DAYS, ON SEDAR+

MONTREAL, Dec. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WSP Global Inc. (TSX: WSP) (“WSP” or the “Corporation”), one of the world’s leading professional services firms, proudly announces it has entered into an agreement to acquire TRC Companies (“TRC”), a premier U.S. Power & Energy brand delivering end-to-end solutions that support the full infrastructure lifecycle (the “Acquisition”), currently majority-owned by funds managed by Warburg Pincus LLC. The proposed Acquisition, for a total cash purchase price of US$3.3 billion (approximately $4.5 billion based on the exchange rate of $1.3762 USD/CAD as of December 15, 2025), marks a significant step on WSP’s journey to achieve its 2025-2027 Global Strategic Action Plan. The proposed Acquisition will position WSP as the largest engineering and design firm in the U.S., supercharging its Power & Energy offering and enhancing its capabilities across Water, Infrastructure, and Environment.

Also commenting on the Acquisition, Christopher P. Vincze, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TRC, said: “The joining of our two firms will create significant and exciting opportunities for our people, our clients and the communities in which we live and work. With TRC’s innovative, technology-oriented power business, underscored by an advanced use of digital, we will significantly strengthen WSP’s Power & Energy offering. Additionally, TRC’s globally recognized Environmental & Infrastructure business, which is the seed from which TRC grew, will enhance WSP’s capabilities across Water, Infrastructure and Environment. Our combined skill sets will elevate us to better support, over the next decade and beyond, our people and planet as we face unprecedented growth of power needs on the back of ongoing electrification, the re-emergence of domestic manufacturing in the U.S. and the continued growth of infrastructure. We were an early pioneer in the utility sector and continue to be a trusted thought partner, working to create, implement and manage complex strategies and programs to meet the country’s power needs. TRC’s people continue to be passionate about making the world a better place, and this next chapter will allow us to come together with WSP in a very exciting way to further that goal.”

Reflecting on their investment, Kim Thomassin, Executive Vice President and Head of Québec at La Caisse said: “With this investment, La Caisse once again demonstrates its ongoing commitment to WSP, helping to position the company as a leader in engineering and design in the United States and globally, while accelerating the development of its Energy offering, a sector with strong potential. This transaction is at the core of our strategy to support the international expansion of companies firmly rooted in Québec and to give them the means to achieve sustainable growth.”

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Proposed Acquisition of TRC for a total cash purchase price of US$3.3 billion (approximately $4.5 billion based on the exchange rate of $1.3762 USD/CAD as of December 15, 2025).

Acquisition price represents 14.5x TRC’s Pre-IFRS 16 CY2026E Adjusted EBITDA7 pre-synergies and 12.5x after including run-rate synergies.8 (TRC’s Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and earnings before net interest and income tax for the financial year ended June 30, 2025 were approximately US$192.3 million ($268.5 million) and US$87.5 million ($122.1 million), respectively).

Expected to be low-to-mid single-digit percentage accretive to WSP’s adjusted net earnings per share before synergies. WSP expects 2027 Accretion (as defined below) to be high single-digit percentage accretive once cost synergies are fully realized (WSP’s basic net earnings per share attributable to shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share were $5.40 and $8.05 respectively, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024).2 9

Expected cost synergies to exceed 3% of TRC’s net revenues for the financial year ended June 30, 20257, plus potential cross-selling revenue synergy opportunities in alignment with our POWER Engineers experience (TRC's net revenues and revenues for the financial year ended June 30, 2025 were approximately US$1,192.2 million and US$1,498.9 million, respectively).8

Transaction to be financed with US$3.3 billion of Committed Acquisition Financing (as defined below).

Estimated pro forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio6 of ~2.4x upon closing of the Acquisition with the expectation to return to below 2.0x within 12 months6 (WSP's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 27, 2025 was 1.4x and adjusted EBITDA and earnings before net financing expense and income taxes for the same period were approximately $2,501.4 million and $1,481.0 million, respectively).

Equity raise of approximately $850 million: $732 million bought deal public offering and approximately $118 million private placement of common shares of WSP (“Common Shares”) expected to close on or about December 22, 2025, with a corresponding reduction of the amounts drawn from the Committed Acquisition Financing. WSP may also opportunistically access debt capital markets to repay a further portion of the Committed Acquisition Financing should market conditions be favourable.

WEBCAST

WSP will host a webcast today at 4:45 p.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss the Acquisition. Exceptionally, there will be no question-and-answer session, given the concurrent equity offering.

To join the webcast, please register at https://www.icastpro.ca/rp92yd or access https://www.wsp.com/en-gl/investors.

A presentation of the Acquisition is accessible on the webcast platform and under the “Investors” section of WSP’s website.

CONDITIONS TO THE ACQUISITION

Subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals, the Acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.

ACQUISITION FINANCING

Equity Financing

The Equity Financing (as defined below) comprises:

$732 million bought deal public offering (the “Offering”) of common shares (the “Offering Common Shares”) at a price of $232.80 per Offering Common Share (the “Offer Price”); and

Approximately $118 million private placement (the “Concurrent Private Placement” and together with the Offering, the “Equity Financing”) of common shares (the “Placement Common Shares”) at the Offer Price to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“La Caisse”).

WSP intends to use the net proceeds from the Equity Financing to fund in part the purchase price payable in respect of the Acquisition (and related costs and expenses) and accordingly reduce amounts to be drawn on the closing of the Acquisition under the Committed Acquisition Financing to fund the purchase price for the Acquisition.

Public Offering

WSP has entered into an agreement with CIBC Capital Markets, BMO Capital Markets and National Bank Capital Markets (the “Joint Bookrunners”), on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters (the “Underwriters”), to issue and sell, on a “bought deal” basis, 3,145,000 Offering Common Shares at the Offer Price for gross proceeds to the Corporation of $732 million.

The Corporation has granted the Underwriters an over-allotment option (the “Over-Allotment Option”), exercisable in whole or in part, for a period of 30 days following the date of the closing of the Offering to purchase up to an additional number of Offering Common Shares equal to 15% of the Offering Common Shares to be sold pursuant to the Offering at the Offer Price to cover over-allotments, if any, and for market stabilization purposes.

The Offering Common Shares distributed pursuant to the Offering will be offered in all provinces and territories of Canada pursuant to a prospectus supplement (the “Prospectus Supplement”) to the short form base shelf prospectus of WSP dated August 8, 2024 (the “Base Shelf Prospectus”) to be filed by WSP on or about December 17, 2025, as well as in the United States by way of private placement to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”).

The completion of the Offering is subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”). Closing of the Offering is expected to occur on or about December 22, 2025 and is conditional upon the concurrent completion of the Concurrent Private Placement.

No securities regulatory authority has either approved or disapproved the contents of this press release. The Offering Common Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the 1933 Act, or any state securities laws. Accordingly, the Offering Common Shares may not be offered or sold within the United States unless registered under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States, nor shall there be any sale of the Offering Common Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Delivery of the Prospectus Supplement, and any amendments to the documents will be provided in accordance with securities legislation relating to procedures for providing access to a shelf prospectus supplement, and any amendment. The Prospectus Supplement will be (within two business days of the date hereof) accessible on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. An electronic or paper copy of the Prospectus Supplement, and any amendment to the documents, may be obtained without charge from CIBC Capital Markets at 161 Bay Street, 5th Floor, Toronto, ON M5J 2S8 or by telephone at 1-416-956-6378 or by email at mailbox.Canadianprospectus@cibc.com by providing the contact with an email address or address, as applicable. The Prospectus Supplement contains important, detailed information about the Corporation and the proposed Offering. Prospective investors should read the Prospectus Supplement (when filed) before making an investment decision.

Concurrent Private Placement

Concurrently with this announcement, WSP has also entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which the Corporation will complete the Concurrent Private Placement at the Offer Price with La Caisse for aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation of approximately $118 million.

La Caisse has also been granted an option (the “Additional Subscription Option”) to purchase a number of additional Placement Common Shares representing up to 15% of the number of Placement Common Shares subscribed by them on closing, subject to, and in the same proportion as the Over-Allotment Option being exercised by the Underwriters.

The issuance of the Placement Common Shares under the Concurrent Private Placement is subject to the approval of the TSX. Closing of the Concurrent Private Placement is scheduled to occur concurrently with the closing of the Offering and is conditional upon the concurrent completion of the Offering.

Assuming completion of the Concurrent Private Placement and the Offering, but not the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option or the Additional Subscription Option, La Caisse will beneficially own, or exercise control or direction over, directly or indirectly, an aggregate of 18,619,100 Common Shares representing approximately 13.9% of the then issued and outstanding Common Shares.

The Placement Common Shares will be subject to a four-month hold from the closing date of the Concurrent Private Placement. In accordance with the terms of the Subscription Agreement, the Placement Common Shares will also be subject to contractual lockups for a period of four (4) months following the date of issuance of such Placement Common Shares.

La Caisse (or their respective designee) will be entitled to a capital commitment fee equal to 4% of the aggregate purchase price for the Placement Common Shares for which they have subscribed (and any additional Placement Common Shares they have subscribed pursuant to the Additional Subscription Option, as applicable).

Committed Acquisition Financing

Concurrently with the announcement of the Acquisition, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as co-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, provided commitments for US$3,300 million senior unsecured non-revolving term loans (collectively, the “Committed Acquisition Financing”). The Committed Acquisition Financing will be governed by an incremental facility supplement to the Corporation’s seventh amended and restated credit agreement dated as of April 27, 2023, as amended and supplemented from time to time, with a syndicate of financial institutions to be entered into on or before the closing of the Acquisition.

All of the above elements of the Acquisition financing plan have been designed and structured with a view to preserving WSP’s investment grade rating.

Related Party Transaction Matters

La Caisse beneficially owns, or has control or direction over, directly or indirectly, Common Shares representing more than 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of WSP. As a result of the foregoing, the Concurrent Private Placement is a “related party transaction” for the purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of minority security holders in special transactions (“MI 61-101”). The Corporation has relied on the exemptions from the valuation and minority approvals of MI 61-101 contained in paragraphs 5.5(a) and 5.7(a) of MI 61-101 on the basis that neither the fair market value of the Concurrent Private Placement (including the capital commitment fee payable thereunder), nor the consideration thereof, exceeds 25% of the market capitalization of the Corporation.

Forward-looking statements made by WSP are based on a number of assumptions believed by WSP to be reasonable as at the date hereof, including assumptions set out through this document and including, without limitation, principal assumptions about the satisfaction of all closing conditions and the successful completion of the Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement within the anticipated timeframe; the expected timing of completion of the Acquisition and the conditions precedent to the closing of the Acquisition (including the receipt of regulatory approvals); WSP’s ability to retain and attract new business, achieve synergies and maintain market position arising from successful integration plans relating to the Acquisition; WSP’s ability to otherwise complete the integration of TRC within anticipated time periods and at expected cost levels; WSP’s ability to attract and retain key employees in connection with the Acquisition; Management’s estimates and expectations in relation to future economic and business conditions and other factors in relation to the Acquisition and resulting impact on growth and accretion in various financial metrics; Management’s expectations in relation to the future performance and economic conditions and other factors in relation to TRC; the realization of the expected strategic, financial and other benefits of the Acquisition in the timeframe anticipated; the accuracy and completeness of the information (including financial information) provided by TRC and publicly available information; the absence of significant undisclosed costs or liabilities associated with the Acquisition; general economic and political conditions; organic growth expectations; economic and market assumptions regarding competition; the state of the global economy and the economies of the regions in which WSP or TRC operates; the state of and access to global and local capital and credit markets; interest rates; working capital requirements; the collection of accounts receivable; WSP obtaining new contract awards; the type of contracts entered into by WSP; the anticipated margins under new contract awards; the adequate utilization of WSP’s workforce; the ability of WSP to attract new clients; the ability of WSP to retain current clients; changes in contract performance; project delivery; WSP’s competitors; the ability of the Corporation to successfully integrate businesses; the acquisition and integration of businesses in the future; WSP’s ability to manage growth; external factors affecting the global operations of WSP; the state of WSP’s backlog and pipeline of opportunities in various reportable segments; the joint arrangements into which WSP has entered or will enter; capital investments made by the public and private sectors; relationships with suppliers and subconsultants; relationships with management, key professionals and other employees of WSP; the maintenance of sufficient insurance; the management of environmental, social and health and safety risks; the sufficiency of the WSP’s current and planned information systems, communications technology and other technology; the sufficiency of the Corporation’s cybersecurity measures; compliance with laws and regulations; future legal proceedings; the sufficiency of internal and disclosure controls; the regulatory environment; impairment of goodwill; foreign currency fluctuation; the expected benefits of acquisitions and the expected synergies to be realized as a result thereof; the tax legislation and regulations to which WSP is subject and the state of WSP’s benefit plans, as well as the assumptions underlying the 2025 financial outlook set out in WSP’s press releases dated February 12, 2025, August 6, 2025 and November 5, 2025. If any of these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, WSP’s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements.

In evaluating these forward-looking statements, investors should specifically consider various risk factors, which, if realized, could cause WSP’s actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to: risks and uncertainties relating to the dilutive effect of the Offering on holders of Common Shares; the fact that the declaration of dividends on the Common Shares is at the discretion of the board of directors of WSP; the fact that the price at which the Common Shares under the Offering are sold by the Underwriters may be less than the Offering Price; the fact that the Concurrent Private Placement may not be completed; Management’s broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of the Offering if the Acquisition is not completed; WSP’s inability to successfully integrate TRC’s business upon completion of the Acquisition; the possible delay or failure to close the Acquisition; the potential failure to realize anticipated benefits from the Acquisition; the potential failure to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all; the currency exchange risk and foreign currency exposure related to the purchase price payable in respect of the Acquisition; WSP’s reliance upon publicly available information and information provided by TRC in connection with, and for the purposes of, the Acquisition; risks associated with historical and pro forma financial information; potential undisclosed costs or liabilities associated with the Acquisition; the fact that WSP does not currently own TRC and that no assurance of TRC’s future performance can be given; WSP’s or TRC’s businesses being adversely impacted during the pendency of the Acquisition; change of control and other similar provisions and fees; risks relating to the post-Acquisition business and operations of WSP and TRC, as well as other risk factors discussed in greater detail in section 20, “Risk Factors,” of WSP’s Management Discussion and Analysis for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024 and in section 17, “Risk Factors,” of WSP’s Management Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 27, 2025, and as may be supplemented from time to time in reports filed by the Corporation with securities regulators or securities commissions or other documents that the Corporation makes public, which are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and which sections are incorporated herein by reference into this cautionary statement.

Although we have attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other risk factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. WSP cautions that the foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other unknown or unpredictable factors could have also a material adverse effect on the performance or results of WSP or TRC. Actual results and events may be significantly different from what we currently expect because of the risks associated with our business, industry and global economy and of the assumptions made in relation to these risks. As such, there can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with forward-looking statements. The completion of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, termination rights and other risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation and as applicable, regulatory approvals, and there can be no assurance that the Acquisition will be completed. There can also be no assurance that if the Acquisition is completed, the strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Acquisition will be realized.

To the extent any forward-looking statement in this document constitutes financial outlook or future-oriented financial information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws, such information is intended to provide investors with information regarding the Corporation, including the Corporation’s assessment of future financial plans, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Financial outlook (including assumptions about future events, including economic conditions and proposed courses of action, based on the Corporation’s assessment of the relevant information currently available), as with forward-looking statements generally, is based on current estimates, expectations and assumptions and is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and other factors. Any financial outlook or future oriented financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent auditor of the Corporation, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to any such financial outlook or future-oriented financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in the Prospectus Supplement relates to the Corporation’s previously issued financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2024. It does not extend to any financial outlook or future-oriented financial information and should not be read to do so.

Differences could arise because of events announced or completed after the date of this press release. All of the forward-looking statements contained in this document are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. The forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of the date hereof (unless otherwise specified) and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except to the extent required by applicable law, WSP does not assume any obligation to publicly update or to revise any forward-looking statements made in this document or otherwise, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Readers are also referred to cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements included in the Prospectus Supplement.

Additional Underlying Assumptions

The Corporation cautions that the assumptions used to prepare the estimated 2027 Accretion, Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, and WSP’s Pro Forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio upon closing of the Acquisition and within 12 months following closing of the Acquisition could prove to be incorrect or inaccurate. Accordingly, the actual results could differ materially from the Corporation’s expectations as set out in this press release. The Corporation considered numerous economic and market assumptions regarding the foreign exchange rate, competition, political environment, and economic performance of each region where the Corporation and TRC operate. In addition to the assumptions disclosed above under “Forward-Looking Statements”, the following assumptions were used to develop these forward-looking financial measures:

2027 Accretion:

WSP’s net revenue organic growth of approximately the same level as the average of the last three years for each of the years until 2027 (WSP’s revenue and net revenue were $16,166.8 million and $12,172.2 million, respectively, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024);

TRC’s net revenue organic growth in line with the last 4-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) revenue growth (TRC revenue and net revenue were approximately US$1,498.9 million and US$1,192.2 million, respectively for the financial year ended June 30, 2025);

TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion supported by a combination of levers, including utilization and pricing, where significant opportunity has been identified;

Expected cost synergies of the Acquisition being fully realized by the end of 2027, with 50% expected to be realized in the first 12 months after closing of the Acquisition.

Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition:

The Acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive upon closing, excluding synergies.

WSP’s net revenue organic growth of approximately the same level as the average of the last three years for each of the years until 2027 (WSP’s revenue and net revenue were $16,166.8 million and $12,172.2 million, respectively, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024);

TRC’s net revenue organic growth in line with the last 4-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) revenue growth (TRC revenue and net revenue were approximately US$1,498.9 million and US$1,192.2 million, respectively for the financial year ended June 30, 2025);

TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion supported by a combination of levers, including utilization and pricing, where significant opportunity has been identified.

TRC Pre-IFRS-16 Adjusted EBITDA and TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA:

TRC high single digit revenue organic growth for the financial year ending December 31, 2026, in line with TRC’s actual performance for the last four years.

TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion supported by a combination of levers, including utilization and pricing, where significant opportunity has been identified;

WSP’s Pro Forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio (upon closing of the Acquisition, and a targeted range within 12 months following closing of the Acquisition):

Acquisition closing date assumed to be March 28, 2026;

WSP’s Adjusted EBITDA2 for the financial year ending December 31, 2025 ranging from $2.54 billion to $2.56 billion10;

TRC’s Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ending June 30, 2026 being in line with TRC’s actual performance of the first 3 months of the financial year ending June 30, 2026;

All elements of WSP’s consolidated statements of cash flows for the applicable period being in line with those generally experienced by WSP in comparable periods;

WSP’s net revenue between $13.8 billion and $14.0 billion for the financial year ending December 31, 2025 (WSP’s net revenue was $12,172.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2024, and WSP’s revenue was $16,166.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2024); and

Cash flow of TRC for the financial year ending June 30, 2026 being in line with TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for the first 3 months of the financial year ending June 30, 2026.

NON-IFRS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Corporation reports its financial results in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting. WSP uses a number of financial measures when assessing its results and measuring overall performance. Some of these financial measures are not calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Accounting Standards (""IFRS""). Regulation 52-112 respecting Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure prescribes disclosure requirements that apply to the following types of measures used by the Corporation: (i) non-IFRS financial measures; (ii) non-IFRS ratios; (iii) total of segments measures; (iv) capital management measures; and (v) supplementary financial measures.

In this document, the following non-IFRS and other financial measures may be used by the Corporation: 2027 Accretion; Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition; Net Revenues; Net Revenue Organic Growth, Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted Net Earnings; Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share; and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio. Other than in respect of 2027 Accretion and Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition which are each defined below, explanations of the composition and usefulness of these measures can be found in section 19, “Glossary of segment reporting measures, non-IFRS and other financial measures” of WSP’s MD&A for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 27, 2025 (the “Q3 2025 MD&A”), which section is incorporated by reference in this document, as posted on WSP’s website at www.wsp.com, and filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS are provided in section 8, “Financial Review” and section 9, “Liquidity” in each of WSP's MD&A for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 29, 2024, WSP’s MD&A for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, WSP’s MD&A for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, WSP’s MD&A for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 28, 2025 and in the Q3 2025 MD&A, which sections are also incorporated by reference in this document, as posted on WSP’s website at www.wsp.com, and filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

The information in this document also includes non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and non-U.S. GAAP financial ratios with respect to TRC, namely TRC Net Revenues, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin. These measures are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, including WSP’s. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement U.S. GAAP measures by providing further understanding of TRC’s results of operations. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of TRC’s financial statements reported under U.S. GAAP. WSP discloses TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA because this non-U.S. GAAP measure is a key measure used by TRC to evaluate its business, measure its operating performance and make strategic decisions. WSP believes TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operations results in the same manner as TRC. However, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income before income taxes, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Using this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure to analyze TRC’s business would have material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination of Management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that investors may find significant. In addition, although other companies in its industry may report measures titled adjusted EBITDA or similar measures, such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how TRC calculates non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, which reduces their overall usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and TRC’s other financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

These measures are defined as follows:

“TRC Net Revenues” has the same definition as WSP’s definition of “net revenues,” being revenues less direct costs for subconsultants and other direct expenses that are recoverable directly from clients.

“TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as TRC earnings before net interest and income taxes, excluding depreciation, amortization and acquisition and integration expenses and unusual items.

“TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as the TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for operating lease costs.

“TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as the TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, divided by TRC Net Revenues.

“TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as the TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, divided by TRC Net Revenues.

WSP uses the following non-IFRS and other financial measures in this document with respect to the Corporation, in each case on a pro-forma basis after giving effect to the Acquisition, the Offering, the Concurrent Private Placement, advances and funds expected to be drawn under the Committed Acquisition Financing and any Acquisition related adjustments, as if each had been completed at the beginning of the relevant period:

“WSP Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,” for the purpose of calculating the WSP Pro Forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio;

“WSP Pro Forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio”; and

“WSP Pro Forma Net Revenues”.

“2027 Accretion” or “accretive” is calculated as the increase in WSP’s forecasted pro forma adjusted net earnings per share for the financial year ending December 31, 2027 after giving effect to the Acquisition, the Offering, the Concurrent Private Placement, advances and funds expected to be drawn under the Committed Acquisition Financing and any Acquisition-related adjustments, as if it had been completed on January 1, 2027, as compared to WSP’s forecasted adjusted net earnings per share for the financial year ending December 31, 2027 on a stand-alone basis. Refer to “Additional Underlying Assumptions” in this document.

“Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition” is calculated as the increase in WSP’s forecasted pro forma adjusted net earnings per share immediately after giving effect to the Acquisition, the Offering, the Concurrent Private Placement, advances and funds expected to be drawn under the Committed Acquisition Financing and any Acquisition-related adjustments, as compared to WSP’s forecasted adjusted net earnings per share on a stand-alone basis. Refer to “Additional Underlying Assumptions” in this document.

The non-IFRS and other financial measures used in this document do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS. Management of the Corporation believes that these non-IFRS and other financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation and the other entities referenced herein as they provide additional key metrics of their performance. Refer to section 19 “Glossary of segment reporting, non-IFRS and other financial measures” of the Q3 2025 MD&A for more information on the usefulness to investors of each such measures. These non-IFRS and other financial measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meanings prescribed under IFRS and may differ from similar computations as reported by other issuers, and accordingly may not be comparable. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “$” in this document are to Canadian dollars and all references to “US$” refer to United States dollars. Where financial information of TRC has been converted from U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars for purposes of comparison to and combination with, financial information of WSP, U.S. dollars have been converted to Canadian dollars at an exchange rate of $1.3952 Canadian dollars per US$1.00.

TRC’s financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). IFRS differs in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. The financial information of TRC presented in this document has not been adjusted to give effect to the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS or to accounting policies that comply with IFRS and as applied by WSP, nor has such financial information been conformed from accounting principles under U.S. GAAP to IFRS as issued by the IASB, and thus may not be directly comparable to WSP’s financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. We have assessed the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for TRC and have determined the impact to be immaterial except for Lease Accounting. Under IFRS, Lease Accounting is governed by IFRS 16 while under U.S. GAAP, it is governed by Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842. While similar with regards to the recognition of leases on the balance sheet, the standards have many differences in application. However, the impact of the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for Lease Accounting on the pro forma financial measures presented in this document, namely WSP Pro Forma Net Revenue and WSP Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, is immaterial, such that no adjustments would be necessary.

WSP’s financial information for the trailing 12-month period ended June 28, 2025 presented herein has been derived by adding WSP’s unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the six-month period ended June 28, 2025 to its audited consolidated financial information for the financial year ended December 31, 2024, and subtracting its unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the six-month period ended June 29, 2024. WSP’s financial information for the trailing 12-month period ended September 27, 2025, presented herein has been derived by adding WSP’s unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine-month period ended September 27, 2025 to its audited consolidated financial information for financial year ended December 31, 2024, and subtracting its unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024.

The approximate number of employees is as at December 2, 2025.

2 Non-IFRS ﬁnancial measure or non-IFRS ﬁnancial ratio that is forward-looking, without a standardized deﬁnition under IFRS, which may not be comparable to similar measures or ratios used by other issuers. Please refer to the “Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures” and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" disclaimers below. For the financial year ended December 31, 2024, WSP's adjusted EBITDA was $2,185.7 million, basic net earnings per share attributable to shareholders was $5.40 and adjusted net earnings per share was $8.05.

3 Cost synergies to exceed 3% of TRC’s net revenue are expected to be achieved by the end of 2027, with 50% expected to be realized in the first 12 months after closing of the Acquisition. The cost to realize synergies is estimated at the same level of synergies.

4 Based on ENR’s Top 500 U.S. Design Firms list in August 2025, calculated on U.S. Revenues and adjusted to reflect annualization of POWER Engineers’ contribution for the financial year ended December 31, 2024, the assumed completion of the Acquisition as well as WSP U.S. Pro Forma Revenues. Please refer to the ""Forward-Looking Statements"" disclaimer below.

5 Based on WSP U.S.’s Power and Energy net revenues for the trailing twelve-month (TTM) period ended June 28, 2025, and TRC’s Power and Energy net revenues for the financial year ended June 30, 2025. USD/CAD exchange rate used to convert TRC net revenue Power and Energy sector into Canadian dollars is 1.3952.

7 Non-IFRS financial measure or non-IFRS ratio that is forward-looking, without a standardized definition under IFRS, which may not be comparable to similar measures or ratios used by other issuers. Please refer to the “Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures” and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" disclaimers below.

8 Cost synergies to exceed 3% of TRC's net revenue for the financial year ended June 30, 2025 are expected to be achieved by the end of 2027, with 50% expected to be realized in the first 12 months after closing of the Acquisition. The cost to realize synergies is estimated at the same level of synergies.

9 The Corporation’s assessment of potential synergy opportunities for the Acquisition is primarily based on the information received as part of its due diligence investigation of TRC, its own outside-in perspectives, previous acquisition experience and publicly available information.

10 The target ranges were prepared assuming no ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates in markets in which the Corporation operates. The Corporation anticipates organic growth in net revenues by segment will be in the mid-to-high single digits in its Canadian operations, mid single digit growth for its Americas operations, mid-single digits growth in EMEIA and low-to-mid single digit organic contraction in APAC. Head oﬃce corporate costs in 2025 are expected to be between $145 million and $160 million.

11 TRC pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended June 30, 2025 are not including the pro forma annualized contribution of acquisitions completed during the 2025 exercise. If we include the annualized contribution of these acquisitions, the pro forma TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA would have been $US196.8M and $US211.7M, respectively.

12 TRC net revenues for the financial year ended June 30, 2025 are not including the proforma annualized contribution of acquisitions completed during the June 30, 2025 financial year-end. If we include the annualized contribution of these acquisitions, the pro forma TRC net revenues would have been $US 1,206.8M.",https://www.wsp.com/-/media/investors/gl/image/wsp-logo-thumbnail-1200x630.png,N,,2025-12-16 13:01:27.271172

This series features concise summaries of commodity-specific sections extracted from the report. Explore the full report here.

The World Bank’s metals and minerals price index steadied in November after surging 6 percent in October, building on a 4 percent rise in 2025Q3. These gains are supported by resilient demand and emerging supply concerns, particularly for copper. Prices for most base metals are expected to firm further in 2026 and 2027 as modest demand growth coincides with tightening supply conditions. While a range of upside risks could push metal prices above baseline projections—including possible production disruptions, new trade restrictions, and a faster-than-expected expansion of data centers—the overall balance of risks remains tilted to the downside. Weaker-than-anticipated growth in major economies continues to pose the most significant risk to metal demand.

Resilient global activity continued to support metal demand. Despite elevated uncertainty—including from trade tensions—global activity remained steady, with manufacturing PMIs returning to expansion after a brief dip into contraction earlier in the year. China’s activity also held up better than expected, supported by accommodative policies and strong exports, although persistent weakness in its property sector continues to weigh on demand for construction-related metals, particularly iron ore. Even so, rising investment in renewable energy technologies and electrification infrastructure is providing an offset, supporting demand for metals such as aluminum and copper.

Supply conditions remain tight across several metals. Base metals production growth was subdued through the first three quarters of the year and is expected to remain weak over the forecast period. For several key metals, including aluminum and copper, output growth is being constrained by operational disruptions and production limits. Recent disruptions at major mining operations—including the incident at Indonesia’s Grasberg mine, one of the world’s largest copper mines—underscore the vulnerability of global supply. On the policy side, China’s aluminum output is nearing its self-imposed 45-million-metric-ton annual cap, reinforcing constraints on additional production growth. By contrast, iron ore supply is set to expand, supported by rising production in major producer countries and new low-cost output from the Simandou project in Guinea.

Metal prices are expected to rise further in 2026–27. The World Bank’s base metal price index is expected to increase by almost 2 percent over this period. Aluminum, nickel, tin, and copper are expected to see the largest increases, with copper and tin—both essential for clean-energy technologies—projected to reach new record highs in nominal U.S. dollar terms. These forecasts assume persistent supply constraints that are expected to keep markets for several base metals, including aluminum, copper, and tin, relatively tight through 2027. Nonetheless, subdued global growth, including in China, may temper the pace of demand expansion. Iron ore prices, by contrast, are expected to decline further in 2026–27, falling below 2019 levels.

The price outlook is subject to numerous risks, with the balance tilted to the downside. On the upside, however, several supply-side factors could push prices above current projections. Metal production is vulnerable to unexpected disruptions from extreme weather, new regulatory measures, energy or water shortages, operational challenges, or labor disputes. Such disruptions could tighten markets, especially for aluminum, copper, and tin. Trade restrictions also present upside risks: recent U.S. tariffs on semi-finished copper products and aluminum, along with potential future tariffs on refined copper, could disrupt supply chains and lift prices. A faster-than-expected expansion of AI-related data centers represents a further upside risk, given their intensive metal use.

Even so, downside risks dominate. The most significant is weaker-than-expected global growth—particularly in China, which accounts for about half of global base metal consumption. Metal demand is highly sensitive to investment and durable goods production, so rising geopolitical tensions, renewed trade frictions, or elevated policy uncertainty could weaken growth and place significant downward pressure on demand and prices.",https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/metals-cmo-1?qlt=90&hei=630&wid=1200&fit=hfit,N,,2025-12-16 16:01:01.513989

Ford says it plans to shift in 2026 to production of large storage battery systems at its Kentucky plants. It is massive change to commonwealth economic hopes that soared in 2021 when Ford and SK On of Korea announced plans to invest $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs at twin factories along I-65 in Hardin County. Customer demand for EVs has not materialized as expected and the federal government has ended cash incentives supporting their purchase as well as dropping vehicle mileage goals that EVs aimed to achieve.

Battery energy storage business

Ford is launching a new business — including sales and service — to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid. Ford plans to repurpose existing U.S. battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Kentucky, to serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market. This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford. The company also plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.

The Kentucky site will be converted to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility. These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers.

Leveraging more than a century of manufacturing expertise and licensed advanced battery technology, Ford plans to bring initial capacity online within 18 months, positioning the company to capture share in the growing U.S. battery energy storage systems market. Ford currently plans to deploy at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.

Ford states in a new release that it is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storage business. As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.

This approach prioritizes affordability, choice and profits. Ford will expand powertrain choice — including a range of hybrids and extended-range electric propulsion — while focusing its pure electric vehicle development on its flexible Universal EV Platform for smaller, affordable models. It is stopping production of the F-150E that was to use the EV batteries manufactured in Kentucky and making that vehicle an extended range hybrid.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

These actions provide a path to profitability in Model e by 2029, targeting annual improvements beginning in 2026. The actions will also improve profits in Ford Blue and Ford Pro over time with early signs of benefits in 2026. As a result, Ford expects to post about $19.5 billion in special costs on its corporate books, the majority in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the remainder in 2026 and 2027. As part of these special items, the company expects $5.5 billion in cash effects, with the majority paid in 2026 and the remainder in 2027.

Ford and its subsidiaries do plan to hire thousands of people across America, reinforcing the company’s leadership as the top employer of U.S. hourly autoworkers.

More gas, hybrids and low-cost EVs

By 2030, Ford expects approximately 50% of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025.

Ford will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform. This next-generation architecture is engineered to underpin a high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles designed to be accessible to millions of customers.

The first vehicle from the Universal EV Platform will be the fully connected midsize pickup truck assembled at Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.

Ford plans to expand hybrids with a range of executions based on customer needs and duty cycle — economical, performance hybrids and hybrids with exportable power. Ford is enhancing its strategy for larger trucks and SUVs to better align with customer demand for capability, towing and range, which includes adding extended-range electric options to its lineup.

As part of this plan, Ford’s next-generation F-150 Lightning will shift to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture and be assembled at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. Production of the current generation F-150 Lightning has concluded as Ford redeploys employees to Dearborn Truck Plant to support a third crew for F-150 gas and hybrid truck production as a result of the Novelis fires.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer. “Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love — 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration — and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive. It will be an incredibly versatile tool delivered in a capital-efficient way.”",https://ae-lane-report.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/08134133/BlueOval-SK-Battery-Park-Ghafari.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 11:05:35.052723

This forward momentum continued despite evolving supply chains and ongoing policy uncertainty.

Overall Q3 installations increased 31% year-over-year, though the market declined 6% compared to Q2 2025’s record highs. The utility-scale storage segment drove growth with 4.6 GW installed in Q3, a 27% increase year-over-year, with 82% of installed capacity concentrated in Texas and California.

The residential storage market continued its expansion for the sixth consecutive quarter, installing 647 MW in Q3, a 70% year-over-year increase. California, Arizona and Illinois led deployments as attachment rates reached new highs. Wood Mackenzie projects Q4 2025 will set a record for the residential sector as customers accelerate installations ahead of the Sec. 25D ITC expiration.

The community, commercial and industrial (CCI) segment installed 33 MW in Q3, down 8% year-over-year. California captured 54% of installations with 17.8 MW, while Illinois emerged as a key growth market alongside Massachusetts, driven by state rebate programs and community storage projects.

“Strong growth in the U.S. energy storage market reflects a simple reality: Meeting rising demand and keeping the grid reliable increasingly requires storage,” said John Hensley, ACP Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis. “These installations deliver the flexible, reliable grid support America needs today, boosting reliability and keeping power bills in check.”

Although domestic battery manufacturing continues to ramp up to meet new tariffs and non-foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirements for the ITC, Wood Mackenzie projects near-term supply chain adjustments and constraints will drive an 11% contraction in the U.S. utility-scale storage market in 2026 and an 8% decline in 2027. However, the market is positioned for strong recovery, with double-digit year-over-year growth projected for 2028 and 2029 as domestic manufacturing capacity comes online.

Overall, Wood Mackenzie forecasts nearly 93 GW of storage will be installed across the United States over the next five years. Notably, the utility-scale five-year forecast has increased 15% compared to pre-One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) projections, while the CCI segment is projected to grow 23% from 2025 to 2029.

“Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”

California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) 3.0 and Illinois’ rebate programs are sustaining steady CCI deployment through 2029. Meanwhile, the residential segment’s shift toward third-party ownership models — which accounted for 57% of the market in Q3 2025 — is helping to mitigate the impact of the Sec. 25D expiration.

Allison Weis, Global Head of Storage at Wood Mackenzie, said “We’re seeing states step up with innovative programs, grids increasingly reliant on storage for reliability and costs at record lows. The industry’s ability to navigate these challenges and maintain a 15% increase in our five-year utility forecast since the passage of the OBBA demonstrates that storage has evolved from an emerging technology to an essential grid resource.”

After roughly 20 years of flat or minimal growth in U.S. electricity demand, power needs are rising and are expected to surge in the next several decades.
data centers and appear to recoup the costs by raising residential utility bills,” the senators said in their letters.
Tech companies are pushing to build many more data centers to meet current and anticipated demand for cloud computing and artificial intelligence.","Three Democratic senators said on Tuesday that they are investigating whether and how the operations of technology companies are driving up residential electricity bills.

In letters sent on Monday to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and three other companies, the lawmakers said the energy needs of data centers used for artificial intelligence were forcing utilities to spend billions of dollars to upgrade the power grid. Energy companies typically recoup the money they invest in equipment through the rates they charge all users of electricity.

The senators — Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — said they were concerned that customers other than the tech companies would be stuck footing the bill, especially if the A.I. boom ended.

“We write in light of alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as A.I. data centers’ energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities,” the senators said.

Most of the companies said they did not have an immediate comment. CoreWeave did not respond to a request for comment. One company, Digital Realty, said in a statement that it “looks forward to working with all elected officials to continue to invest in the digital infrastructure required to support America’s leadership in technology.”

The biggest tech companies have consistently said they want to pay their fair share of energy costs and in some states have brokered deals with utilities to try to do so. But there is little consensus about exactly how much they should pay.

Contracts between data centers and utility companies are almost always confidential, leaving the public in the dark on why electric bills have risen. The lawmakers, who are seeking responses by Jan. 12, cited an article in The New York Times in August that detailed the tech companies’ growing role in the electricity business and their impact on energy costs.

Many forces are causing electricity rates to increase, including the replacement of old plants and hardening of power lines against wild fires. But data centers are a particularly hot-button issue given how much their demand is expected to grow.

Concern about rising electricity rates has emerged as a leading economic and political issue. Rising electricity prices played a big role in recent elections, including statewide races in Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia.

A recent study from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that data centers have probably helped reduce average retail electricity prices in recent years by spreading the fixed upgrade costs over more customers. But the authors said it was hard to know whether this trend would continue as demand for energy continued to rise sharply. They pointed to a large increase this year in power prices in the Mid-Atlantic region that has been linked to data centers.

After roughly 20 years of flat or minimal growth in U.S. electricity demand, power needs are rising and are expected to surge in the next several decades. In addition to the four tech giants, the senators sent letters to CoreWeave, Digital Realty and Equinix — companies that specialize in providing data centers and computing power for other businesses.

The large, boxy data center buildings filled with computer servers consumed more than 4 percent of the nation’s electricity in 2023. Government analysts estimate that will increase to as much as 12 percent in just three years. That’s because computers that train A.I. systems consume much more electricity than those used for popular internet services like Netflix or TikTok.

To meet that demand, energy companies have rushed to build more power plants and power lines. Although tech companies are shouldering a lot of those costs, they are not paying for all of it. Some of the expenses are ultimately borne by other businesses and individuals through higher electricity rates.

“Utility companies have spent billions of dollars updating the electrical grid to accommodate the unprecedented energy demands of A.I. data centers and appear to recoup the costs by raising residential utility bills,” the senators said in their letters.

Tech companies are pushing to build many more data centers to meet current and anticipated demand for cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon spent more than $360 billion on capital expenditures in just the first nine months of the year.

The senators noted that a growing push for new nuclear reactors, which are much more expensive to build than wind, solar and natural gas projects, could raise electricity costs even more.

The average cost for electricity for the typical household that uses 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity rose 7 percent in September from a year earlier, to about $181, according to the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency.

President Trump signed an executive order last week to encourage A.I. development and limit the ability of states to slow its progress.

However, with real oil prices now below their 2014 level, the question is whether there will be another bust in the oil industry.
Low oil prices are bad news from the standpoint of moving away from fossil fuels, but given the low-cost of buying and maintaining EVs, low oil prices may not matter much in countries outside the United States where people have the option to buy them.
Low oil prices also will have the advantage that they will undermine Trump’s effort to destroy the country’s environment for future generations.
Drilling on the north slope of Alaska and other formerly protected areas will not be profitable with oil prices under $60 a barrel.","Trump has been boasting about the drop in gas prices lately, and he does have more of a case than usual. Gas prices are actually down by a bit more than 3 percent from their year ago level, although diesel prices are up 5 percent. (It’s not clear what Trump has against truckers.)

Anyhow, the cause is not a mystery. After soaring following the pandemic reopening and then rising further after sanctions were imposed on Russia’s oil following its invasion of Ukraine, the price of oil has fallen below $60 a barrel. This is good news from the standpoint of cheap gas, but it’s not good news from the standpoint of the U.S. oil industry.

Adjusted for inflation, the current price of $57 a barrel is less than the price of oil in 2016, when production and employment in the industry plummeted. At that time, many of the companies that had rushed into fracking in Texas and New Mexico when bankrupt, as the price no longer covered their costs. Employment in the broader mining and logging category went from a peak of over 900,000 in 2014 to a trough of less than 650,000 in 2016, a drop of almost 30 percent.

Oil prices rose somewhat later in the decade and some of these jobs came back, but employment never approached the 2014 level. However, with real oil prices now below their 2014 level, the question is whether there will be another bust in the oil industry.

Already, the number of rigs has been declining as many producers are putting off new drilling. Employment is down by more than 30,000 from its level of two years ago. And there are reports of further layoffs to come.

Low oil prices are a result of not only the Biden-Trump policy of promoting drilling, but increased production worldwide following the pandemic price jumps, and slower demand growth due to the spread of EVs and clean energy. While betting on the oil market is a dangerous game, there are good reasons for thinking the price is more likely to go lower than higher.

Most immediately, there seems a reasonable prospect of some sort of settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war. Any settlement will almost certainly lead to an end of sanctions on Russian oil, which would increase the amount of oil on world markets by millions of barrels a day. There is also the possibility that Venezuelan oil could come back on world markets, either through Trump overthrowing the current government or a rapprochement with Maduro.

World Demand for Oil Could be Falling Soon

On the demand side, EV sales are rapidly growing in markets around the world. In China their share is already well over 50 percent of the market and rising rapidly. China is also exporting low cost high quality EVs to the rest of the world leading to rapid growth in market share elsewhere.

China has also hugely reduced the cost of wind and solar energy, as well as battery storage, leading to huge growth in clean energy use in China and many other countries. If these trends continue, oil demand is likely to be headed downward in the not distant future. This could mean that oil prices fall even further from their recent levels.

Low oil prices are bad news from the standpoint of moving away from fossil fuels, but given the low-cost of buying and maintaining EVs, low oil prices may not matter much in countries outside the United States where people have the option to buy them. That’s unfortunate, since we will effectively be freeloading in getting the climate benefit of other countries’ greenhouse gas emission reductions, but it will hardly be the first time the United States was a freeloader.

Low oil prices also will have the advantage that they will undermine Trump’s effort to destroy the country’s environment for future generations. Drilling on the north slope of Alaska and other formerly protected areas will not be profitable with oil prices under $60 a barrel. As much as Trump might be trying to turn America into a shithole country before he leaves office, cheap oil can undermine his efforts.

Learning to Love Cheap Oil

A serious government would be doing everything it can right now to promote a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Whatever Donald Trump might think, he can’t stop global warming by executive order. But we don’t have a serious government, we have Donald Trump and his lackeys in the House, Senate, and the Supreme Court.

However, his efforts to promote drilling everywhere may have some desirable effects. It could financially devastate his friends in the oil industry. It will be unfortunate that oil workers will lose jobs, but seeing the share prices plummet of the companies that pushed lies about global warming for decades will be a pleasant sight. And the economics may save environmentally sensitive areas that we currently lack the political force to protect. All in all, not a bad story.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Oil_Platform_Crew_Transfer.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 16:01:05.459940

Groups that work in Florida for environmental justice are voicing concerns about the Environmental Protection Agency putting off a big decision.

The agency’s 2024 methane rule would require major reductions in methane emissions and other air pollution from the oil and gas industry. The move to delay implementing it for another 18 months has drawn strong criticism from groups – including WE ACT for Environmental Justice, which says local communities bear the health and economic burdens of this pollution.

Yosef Robele, federal policy manager for WE ACT, said the delay directly puts public health protections at risk.

“This delay is, unfortunately, more likely than not going to result in unnecessary deaths and increased hospital visits,” he said, “or continuation of high rates of ER visits; public health burdens being placed on communities near it.”

The EPA’s own analysis shows the methane rule could prevent 1,500 premature deaths and 100,000 asthma attacks each year. Environmental groups say delaying enforcement undermines protections for communities living closest to industrial emissions.

Florida doesn’t have the same concentration of oil and gas refinery sites as does Louisiana or Texas, but some neighborhoods face related risks from landfills, gas infrastructure and industrial emitters.

Robele warned that without stronger federal standards, methane and toxic pollutants will continue to worsen asthma, heat-related illnesses and hurricane-driven exposure, especially for lower-income areas that already struggle with medical costs.

“With increased extreme weather events, as well as many other impacts,” he said, “this is just going to continue hitting us harder every year that we delay important actions such as this one.”

The EPA has pushed compliance at least into next year, and advocates say they’re evaluating legal and policy options to ensure the rule is ultimately implemented. They argue stronger methane standards would reduce pollution, lower long-term health costs and help states such as Florida better withstand escalating climate-related disasters.

Notably, SK On said it will likely use the battery manufacturing facility it took in the joint venture split for energy storage system (ESS) manufacturing, too.

Shortly after news broke that Ford and South Korean battery firm SK On were ending a US battery manufacturing joint venture, Ford announced a series of actions that it said will redeploy capital to meet customer demand and ‘drive profitable growth’.

It will shift to ‘higher-return opportunities’, adding trucks and vans to its lineup and launching a new, ‘high-growth’ battery energy storage business.

Notably, SK On said it will likely use the battery manufacturing facility it took in the joint venture split for energy storage system (ESS) manufacturing, too.

The US-based carmaker has also cancelled plans to produce larger EVs where ‘the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes’.

The F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck has been discontinued. Ford had a vehicle-to-home (V2H) bidirectional charging partnership with US residential solar and energy storage installer and leasing company Sunrun for the F-150 Lightning, launched in 2021. The carmaker said a forthcoming next-generation F-150 Lightning would be an extended range electric vehicle (EREV), i.e., a hybrid pairing batteries with backup generation.

Ford had already scrapped plans for a three-row electric SUV because there was no path to profitability as the vehicle would have to be high-priced to cover the cost of the large battery required to power it. The company previously recorded huge losses as it slashed the price of its Model e EV to the extent it was unprofitable.

Instead, Ford reaffirmed that it will maintain its focus on its Ford Universal EV Platform for smaller models, separately expanding its powertrain range to include hybrid vehicles.

Ford president and CEO Jim Farley, speaking on the Bloomberg Talks podcast hosted by media outlet Bloomberg, said that the new plans were driven by “the customer changing their decision”.

Customer choice and decision-making have been the reasoning used by US President Donald Trump as he undid much of the pro-EV legislation of the previous administration.

This is despite the fact that EV sales went way up (66%) just before tax credits ended, something that indicates a wide intention to move to an EV that had perhaps only been stalled by the cycle of new car purchasing.

Globally, the shift to EV as battery prices drop to reach cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) manufacturing threatens to leave the US behind.

Farley said that changed regulations were the cause of Ford’s changing strategy, but insisted that the company still plans to go 50% electric: “There are no gas guzzlers in our future at Ford but we want to offer customers choice, that’s what the President is trying to do: give people choice.”

Farley also recently praised President Trump’s move to reset US fuel standards as a “victory” for affordability.

Ford will not produce a previously planned electric commercial van for Europe, but will continue offering its electric van range in that market. It will replace a planned electric commercial van for North America with gas and hybrid models that it said are designed to be more affordable.

On the company’s BlueOval City campus, Tennessee Electric Vehicle Centre, will be renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant and produce gas-powered trucks; likewise, its Ohio assembly plant will focus on a gas- and hybrid-powered commercial van.

Storage shift

Ford said it will repurpose existing battery manufacturing capacity in Kentucky, leveraging underutilised EV battery capacity to serve the ESS market, with the site converted to manufacture 5MWh+ advanced lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery energy storage systems (BESS).

Speaking again to Bloomberg, Farley said the company is targeting 20GWh production at the Kentucky site in “a big pivot that is profit positive for the company”, due to land in late 2027.

When pushed by podcast host Matt Miller, Farley conceded that the carmaker is, in Miller’s words, “partnering, effectively, with a Chinese company” in its storage plans, but added: “We have a licensing agreement but we feel it’s better to build these batteries in the US with American workers […] The best way to compete with the Chinese is to get close to the IP and run the plants at Ford.”

He also clarified that the company will “actually be selling the huge storage containers” to utilities and data centre companies, not “just the cells as a contract manufacturer”.

This suggests the company will assemble BESS units, while other comments Farley made referenced servicing too.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blt85cdfeb44fbd411b/69414f5addf354b5c827eaf1/ford_doug_field.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-16 11:06:11.164597

The company will no longer make large-vehicle EVs, instead developing a Universal EV Platform for smaller, affordable models.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

By 2030, Ford expects approximately 50% of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025. Ford will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform. This next-generation architecture is engineered to underpin a high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable EVs designed to be accessible to millions of customers. The first vehicle from the Universal EV Platform will be the fully connected midsize pickup truck assembled at Louisville (Kentucky) Assembly Plant starting in 2027.

The next-generation F-150 Lightning will shift to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture and be assembled at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. Production of the current generation F-150 Lightning has concluded.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer. “Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love — 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration — and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive. It will be an incredibly versatile tool delivered in a capital-efficient way.”

Launching a battery energy storage system business

Ford is launching a new business — including sales and service — to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid. Ford plans to repurpose existing U.S. battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Kentucky, to serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market. The company also plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.

The Kentucky site will be converted to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, BESS modules and 20-ft DC container systems at this facility. Ford plans to bring initial capacity online within 18 months and reach at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.

Separately, Ford will utilize BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, Michigan, to produce smaller Amp-hour cells for use in residential energy storage solutions. This plant remains on track to begin manufacturing LFP prismatic battery cells in 2026 to power Ford’s upcoming midsize electric truck, the first model on the new Universal EV Platform.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blueoval-plant-michigan-ford.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 11:09:14.636629

A priority for any tech company should be maximizing efficiency – from chip and model design through development of the data center itself.
AI companies that are serious about their climate impact should account for and seek to reduce these potentially significant upstream methane emissions.
What steps are you taking to ensure that data center neighbors and ratepayers are not burdened with additional costs or pollution?
The density of computing power within AI data centers requires sophisticated cooling systems to keep chips functioning.","The rush to commercialize AI is transforming the technology industry from asset-light, knowledge-based companies to capital- and energy-intensive infrastructure developers. Already enabled by an unprecedented surge in capital, AI spending is projected to reach more than $400 billion in 2025, and McKinsey projects data centers to soak up nearly $7 trillion of capital expenditure worldwide by 2030.

The industry’s focus on speed and scale translates to an urgent need for investors to understand the physical footprint and supply chain risks of AI and its ecosystem – the utilities powering AI data centers, the chipmakers providing hardware, real estate firms developing massive data complexes, and the suppliers of critical minerals and other commodities for tech hardware. Failure to do so could put invested capital at risk.

The “build at any cost” approach of the past few years presents challenges for communities and the public interest. AI infrastructure, especially emissions from the electricity that runs data centers and the water often used to cool them, has real implications for human health and the environment. How that infrastructure is planned, built and paid for affects both nearby communities and electricity customers across wide regions – not to mention the global impacts of climate change driven by AI-related greenhouse gas emissions.

If developed in the right way, AI investments could usher in a clean, modernized power system that lowers electricity costs and helps tame climate change. But the current path points in another direction: a breakneck pace that stresses the environment in myriad ways, ignores efficiency and innovations that can improve environmental outcomes and reduce costs, and risks a backlash – from regulators, customers, and the public at large – with a host of negative consequences for tech companies and their backers. Now is the time for investors to engage with the sector on how companies are incorporating sustainability drivers into data center growth.

Here are five questions that investors can ask technology companies to start the conversation:

1. How are you leveraging efficiency, innovation and zero carbon electricity across the AI supply chain?

Demand for clean electricity is being outpaced by the intense energy needs of AI computing, putting a strain on tech companies’ climate targets. A priority for any tech company should be maximizing efficiency – from chip and model design through development of the data center itself. Similarly, there is a range of innovative customer-side approaches that can shift, manage, or reduce power demand, and tech companies should make full use of these to reduce environmental footprint and cost.

Beyond these measures, data centers should be powered wherever possible from carbon-free energy resources. Developers should engage utilities to accelerate the deployment of clean energy and enabling technologies like energy storage, and support decarbonizing the grid over time to improve the long-term environmental performance of their data center assets.

A range of promising practices use efficiency and innovative technologies to manage energy use and associated costs. Google uses grid emissions data to shift some large computing workloads to times when renewable power is available. Apple has invested heavily in battery-paired solar projects to expand clean power supply at times of peak demand. Tech firms should be able to show how they’re systematically addressing the need for zero carbon power throughout their data center planning, offer load flexibility to support the grid, and maximize opportunities to reduce energy consumption.

2. Where your power is supplied by natural gas, either onsite or indirectly through a utility company, what measures are you taking to minimize carbon dioxide and methane emissions?

Natural gas accounts for over 40% of US power generation, and powering data centers from existing grid infrastructure or newly added generation can translate to increased fossil fuel pollution. Research from Goldman Sachs suggests natural gas use for AI could increase global carbon emissions by a cumulative 220 million tons – equivalent to Spain’s yearly emissions – through 2030 before carbon-free energy supply catches up with demand growth.

Where natural gas use is unavoidable in the near term, companies should address the associated CO₂ emissions through long-term planning for low-carbon alternatives and explore mitigation technologies such as high-quality carbon capture, utilization and storage.

Upstream from the utility, leaks and intentional venting of methane – a greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the warming power of CO₂ over 20 years – drive up data center climate impacts. Methane emissions differ significantly between regions: aerial surveys find methane loss rates varying by a factor of eight between the highest- and lowest-emitting sourcing areas.

AI companies that are serious about their climate impact should account for and seek to reduce these potentially significant upstream methane emissions. Companies should track and report upstream methane emissions from data center energy use, and engage with their fuel and electricity suppliers to source lower-methane-emissions natural gas. This could include prioritizing gas supplied by members of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, a framework for measuring and reducing methane emissions, or supporting credible efforts to measure, report, and verify lower-emissions gas.

3. What steps are you taking to ensure that data center neighbors and ratepayers are not burdened with additional costs or pollution?

The large power demands of data centers can strain local grids and trigger costly investments in system upgrades – with costs passed along to other utility customers and even to other utilities across the region. Federal data shows that US average electricity prices increased 13% over the past three years and will continue to climb, and studies show that growing demands on the power grid from data centers are contributing to the run-up.

In addition, due to gaps in the patchwork of federal, state and local emissions rules, local communities can bear the brunt of air pollution such as smog-producing nitrogen oxides and particulates from backup diesel generators and other new fossil fuel equipment deployed to meet data center load. These impacts often fall disproportionately on lower-income communities and in areas with elevated industrial air pollution.

Tech companies should be expected to pay the full cost of the generation and associated infrastructure they require to offer AI products and services. Investors should consider how companies are addressing local and regional impacts of data center growth to minimize impacts and preserve social license to operate, including how they engage with communities, utilities and regulators to take full responsibility for their power system costs and not impose additional pollution burdens.

4. How do you incorporate water availability and water stress into your data center design and siting processes?

The density of computing power within AI data centers requires sophisticated cooling systems to keep chips functioning. Many cooling systems rely on circulating liquids to manage this heat, and there are often tradeoffs between the energy intensity and water intensity of cooling system design. Analysts further distinguish between the water directly used within data center operations, which can be on the scale of water use by a small town, and the indirect water use associated with generating electricity, which can be far higher – 80% or more of a data center’s water footprint.

A recent Ceres report found that data center water use in Phoenix is expected to increase by 400% in the coming years, driving increased water stress year-round with higher seasonal spikes. With industry development projections heavily concentrated in a limited number of states, assessing both regional water availability and local water stress at proposed data center locations is necessary to develop a clear picture of siting trade-offs. Investments in water resilience, for example through water conservation, infrastructure improvements and contaminant clean-up, can reduce local water stress and bring value to neighboring communities.

As data center deployment accelerates – including in water-stressed regions like Arizona, parts of Texas, and southern California – investors should evaluate operational risks from water availability and water stress, as well as regulatory risks and community concerns linked to the social and ecosystem impacts of water stress.

5. How are you engaging policymakers and regulators on enabling policy priorities?

The pace of data center growth has made long-standing bottlenecks in the US power system more apparent, and solutions more urgent. In some cases, changes in policy or regulation could make the power system more efficient, effective, and responsive to the people and businesses that rely on it.

One urgent policy issue is the lengthy delays that affect interconnection – the process of bringing new energy supply like solar and wind farms onto the grid. Across most of the country, long interconnection queues mean that projects take years to come online, while new load from data centers can be connected more quickly. Tech companies can engage on regulatory approaches to better match those timelines or connect clean energy resources onsite at data centers to speed access.

Another topic ripe for policy engagement is large load flexibility. Some data center operators are exploring ways to shift computing load, and the associated energy use, between times of day or geographic location to reduce strain on the grid. Incorporating large load flexibility into regulatory structures, with appropriate controls for power system management and safety, could support the use of these approaches to meet near-term electricity needs through efficient use of existing resources. Tech company engagement in policy design can support regulatory updates that align technical capabilities with system-wide benefits.

Q: What advice do you have for other states or large municipalities who want to see deeper penetration of clean energy assets in underserved communities?","As federal climate funding faces uncertainty, state-level coordination has become essential for keeping clean energy projects moving forward, particularly in underserved communities. Ben Dueweke, Director of Michigan’s Climate Investment Hub, talks with us about how the Hub is working to connect capital providers, CDFIs, and community organizations to accelerate equitable climate solutions, and why creating accessible entry points for everyday residents and small businesses may be the key to unlocking broader participation in the clean energy transition.

Q: Can you tell me a bit about the Climate Investment Hub, its genesis and purpose?

A: The Michigan Climate Investment Hub was established by the State of Michigan’s Office of Climate and Energy (under EGLE), who recognized that achieving the State’s climate goals will not only require activating massive amounts of capital, but also additional coordination among public, private, philanthropic and community partners to deploy that capital.

The $20B in funding that was to be released via the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) presented an immediate use case for organizing Michigan’s ecosystem around climate-related finance in order to capitalize on these resources. Though the EPA has since frozen access to these funds, the work of the Hub transcends that program and we will continue to act as a market convener and systems integrator, working with capital providers, lenders, developers, local governments and community organizations to align financial resources with project needs.

Q: What are your thoughts about the key barriers to a broad-based participation in this transition, besides financing?

A: There are absolutely barriers to accelerating the pace of deployment when it comes to clean energy and other decarbonization strategies. One of the most persistent barriers in Michigan (and nationally) is the lack of accessible, trusted entry points for everyday residents, small businesses, community organizations, and public-sector stakeholders to explore project ideas. You would be hard pressed to find someone managing a small business or running a nonprofit that wouldn’t love to put solar on their roof or upgrade their heating and cooling equipment to be more efficient and affordable. However, the current market conditions effectively demand that folks are equipped with the technical fluency and understanding of the options, the benefits, and the means (financial and technical) to actualize this work – which simply isn’t the case.

If we can solve for this – for example with a more robust ecosystem of resources focused on project ideation, pre-development, and development, we can start to build more momentum. This will have a positive feedback effect on jobs and economic growth in the sector, put downward pressure on prices and ultimately expand access to these technologies.

Q: As federal clean energy and climate resilience funding, tax credits and other supports face significant cuts, what is the opportunity for state-level public ecosystem coordinator, and why has that role become more critical for CDFIs and clean energy-finance providers right now?

A: It’s so important that we maintain forward momentum with climate and decarbonization work now, and into the future. Though I’m discouraged by the recent policy changes, the fact is there is an ever-growing demand for more affordable, reliable, and resilient energy systems. CDFIs are such a great example of how climate and clean energy work can augment and be additive to work already being done to strengthen our communities. Whether it’s small business lending, affordable housing, economic development — the CDFI coalition of Michigan and the Detroit CDFI coalition have members that are supporting communities across the state with financing and resources that align with the work of the Hub. We have been working with both Coalitions (who have aligned and coordinated their climate-specific committees) to shape strategy on advancing community resilience and climate solutions through coordinated action in partnership, capital, policy and learning.

The Hub is also aligned and partnered with Michigan Saves (the state’s green bank) and Lean and Green Lending, who administers the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (or C-PACE) program. These two organizations are really the anchors of climate finance in the state, and we’re working with them to support project pipeline development, coordinating with national efforts, and generally building greater capacity.

Q: Understanding that CDFIs and other community-focused lenders have been slow to come into this space, from your vantage point, what do state-level finance ecosystems need most in this moment to keep projects moving to market?

A: I mentioned before the need for better and more accessible ‘entry points’ where folks can take ideas and aspirations, and mold them into projects that are financeable and beneficial for them. Part of the Hub’s work going into 2026 will involve collecting and indexing more data on the interest and demand for climate resilience and clean energy projects across the state. By achieving a better, data-based understanding of the project demand, we can better articulate financial needs, technical and capacity gaps, and also projected benefits and outcomes of the work. This information and synthesis can be used to strategically drive resources to fill these needs as well as to make the case to capital providers to continue to drive their dollars here to Michigan.

The state has an incredible ecosystem of resources – from grant challenges administered by EGLE and our Public Service Commission, to a Tax Credit Technical Assistance Center supporting elective pay for nonprofits. When I’m speaking to people on the project development or sponsor side of things, I’ve found it rare that everyone knows about all of these resources, and I think the role of a Hub as a central information point could be beneficial to many states.

Q: What advice do you have for other states or large municipalities who want to see deeper penetration of clean energy assets in underserved communities?

A: Building two-way trust with local anchor institutions can help both better understand the pain points of a community as well as broaden the understanding of the options and potential benefits of clean energy and other decarbonization strategies. Climate resilience strategies can almost always be applied as a remedy to existing challenges — whether it’s the need for more jobs in a community, healthier housing or more affordable energy costs. We need to further drive the connection between the problems of today and the solutions of tomorrow.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_705996939.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:13.908935

As the state’s water and wastewater agencies have noted, the tariff program increases energy reliability for emergency and essential services, including water pumping needed to fight fires.
Newsom recently touted the jobs benefits of this tariff program’s projects in his California Jobs First initiative, but he will kill those very same jobs by letting the CPUC end this project.
All of this funding and these benefits will be lost, however, if the comission adopts its proposed decision to end the BioMAT program on Thursday.
That means continuing the BioMAT program to reduce wildfires, provide reliable clean energy and create good jobs and economic development.","On Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first day in office, he held a press conference on wildfires and called on state agencies to do more to fight the growing wildfire crisis. Since then, wildfires have only grown more deadly and more expensive. Yet the California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled on Dec. 18 to end an important wildfire reduction and climate protection program, called the Bioengineering Market Adjusting Tariff Program (BioMAT), which requires utilities to buy power from small local projects that convert forest and other organic waste into energy.

The CPUC’s decision to end this program will cause serious harm across the state, including the loss of hundreds of good jobs and nearly $100 million dollars of federal and state funding. Ending the tariff program will also take an important wildfire mitigation tool off the table — even though the CPUC has acknowledged that wildfires are the single biggest cause of increasing electricity costs.

Tribes, water agencies, fire protection and resource conservation districts have all asked the comission to extend the program. As the state’s water and wastewater agencies have noted, the tariff program increases energy reliability for emergency and essential services, including water pumping needed to fight fires.

The CPUC’s decision to end the tariff program is painfully ironic and just plain wrong: First, the Newsom administration frequently criticizes the federal government for ignoring the law, but the CPUC (with five commissioners appointed by the governor) will violate at least two state laws by ending this program before the requirements of those laws are met.

The Newsom administration also criticizes the Trump administration for ignoring science, but the public utilities comission is doing the same thing by ignoring the state’s many climate change, air quality and wildfire reduction plans that call for the tariff program.

Newsom recently touted the jobs benefits of this tariff program’s projects in his California Jobs First initiative, but he will kill those very same jobs by letting the CPUC end this project.

The California Public Utilities Commission’s hypocrisy is deeply troubling: The agency has repeatedly found that the program helps mitigate wildfires and provides other important public health, safety and climate benefits. Now, it’s claiming that it is ending the BioMAT program to save ratepayers money, but it has never quantified the supposed savings and ignores the actual ratepayer savings that this program provides by reducing wildfire costs and increasing energy reliability.

Ironically, while the CPUC is about to end the tariff program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture just approved a loan guarantee for a $42 million forest BioMAT project in the Central Sierras. Both the Newsom Administration and the U.S. Forest Service have provided funding to this project to reduce wildfire risks in an extreme wildfire risk area. The Calaveras County Water District also supports the project, which will help ensure reliable and lower cost energy for the water agency and surrounding community. It will also create good jobs and economic development in a low-income county.

All of this funding and these benefits will be lost, however, if the comission adopts its proposed decision to end the BioMAT program on Thursday.

Newsom was very clear about the urgency of reducing wildfires, the need to follow the science and the law and the importance of protecting public health and safety. The governor should remind the CPUC that those are still the state’s priorities. That means continuing the BioMAT program to reduce wildfires, provide reliable clean energy and create good jobs and economic development.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/ld5ejl/picture312610524/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_209_252210_JV_Newsom.JPG,N,,2025-12-16 11:06:14.482359

The most inspiring colleges aren’t just places of learning. They live their values on campus every day. Catawba College — a private liberal arts institution in Salisbury, NC — has done just that. Established in 1851, it was the first college in the Southeast, and one of only 13 in the nation, to become certified carbon neutral. This is a major achievement for any college campus, particularly one with only around 1,200 students.

And the college is building on its commitment to clean energy and environmental education simultaneously. Catawba’s current capital projects include the construction of new, high-performance buildings, along with the modernization of aging infrastructure. The work is delivering multiple benefits — all while prioritizing cost efficiency. While addressing deferred maintenance, the upgrades will also enhance comfort for students and staff, as well as optimize energy use.

As a small institution, Catawba’s plans for a more resilient future offer a blueprint for other colleges and universities. As facilities age, many are facing similar priorities to maintain and enhance their campuses cost-effectively, while minimizing emissions and lowering exposure to rising energy costs.

RMI collaboration

Catawba has long been a sustainability innovator in higher education, supported by nearly two decades of partnership with RMI. Marty Pickett, RMI’s general counsel and trustee, was introduced to Catawba by our donor Fred Stanback, and Marty has served on the advisory board, alongside Stanback, of Catawba’s Center for the Environment since 2009, a “coming home” of sorts since she grew up less than an hour’s drive away. RMI cofounder Amory Lovins has spoken numerous times over the years at Catawba, on topics such as “Transforming the Energy System for Security and Prosperity” and “Profitable Solutions to Climate, Oil and Proliferation.” and Lovins, Pickett, and various other RMI staff have taught at Catawba’s National Environmental Summit for High School Students for many years, emphasizing RMI’s systems thinking.

Drawing on Amory Lovins’ principles of integrative design and RMI’s expertise, the college has sought advice on various projects including a retrofit of the Center for the Environment’s building, which was a high performance building even before the Green Building Council was established, and collaborated with RMI on advancing the campus’s energy plan that includes investing in its new district energy system.

“Catawba College leadership’s bold vision and actions on sustainability, clean energy, and regenerative design make it an inspiring model for the community, higher education, and most importantly for its students and faculty” noted Marty Pickett.

Catawba’s resilient infrastructure

Since 1996, Catawba’s Center for the Environment has served as a living laboratory for hands-on education, an approach now woven throughout campus life. “We want to be leaders in the field of environmental sustainability and regenerative design,” said Lee Ball, vice president of sustainability and executive director of the Center for the Environment at Catawba. Ball has been at the forefront of initiatives that prepare students to become the next generation of sustainability leaders.

That vision first took tangible form in 2001, when students helped design the center’s original 21,000-square-foot building. Their efforts reduced projected energy consumption by 30–40 percent over the building’s lifetime compared to standard construction. They also recycled more than 86 percent of construction waste, a material circularity practice then well ahead of its time. Reusing or recycling construction waste is essential to cut a project’s resource consumption and overall embodied carbon. While the center was later renovated in 2023, the tradition of student leadership continues, with more than 60 students helping to design the college’s innovative Smokestack and new residence hall projects.

Catawba was also an early leader in its use of renewable energy in higher education. These systems not only reduce emissions but also deliver strong financial returns and provide a more reliable and resilient energy source for the future. In the 1980s, the college installed solar thermal systems, a way to heat water by warming it with the sun. That was followed in 2015 by approximately 837 kW of solar panels. At the time, this installation produced more renewable energy than all other North Carolina higher education institutions combined, while delivering savings forecast to total $5 million over 20 years. In 2024, the college added another 55 kW of solar, with further expansion planned.

A complementary focus of Catawba’s renewable energy strategy is its use of geoexchange systems, which use the Earth’s consistent temperatures below ground to deliver energy-efficient heating and cooling year-round. The college installed its first “open-loop” system in the 1990s using water from local aquifers.

Now a new, more ambitious geoexchange system is taking center stage in the school’s District Energy and Modernization (DEM) project. In 2024, the college drilled 39 wells for a closed-loop geoexchange system that circulates water through a contained pipe network. This updated design is more efficient, more durable, and easier to upgrade than the original open-loop system. It is part of a four-phase installation that will eventually provide heating and cooling to 26 campus buildings. As part of this buildout, wells are being placed beneath the soccer field to centralize maintenance and maximize use of space, says David Karlsgodt, vice president for infrastructure, energy, and sustainability at Washington, D.C.-based Brailsford & Dunlavey. Once complete, “the system will cut at least 265 MMBtu of gas and 145,724 kWh of purchased electrical energy [per year], reducing carbon emissions by 51 metric tons.”

Modernizing for a more resilient future

The DEM project spans nearly every corner of campus and conveniently coincides with significant upgrades to aging equipment and facilities. “Catawba wants to upgrade to operational carbon neutrality in a smart way,” explained Jason Volz, project manager and partner at CMTA, an engineering firm that specializes in sustainable and high-performance building systems. He noted that the college is aligning deferred maintenance needs with a shift toward district energy to move away from fossil fuels, while improving student, staff, and faculty comfort, cutting carbon emissions, and reducing long-term costs.

One example is the Abernethy Physical Education complex, a 90,000-square-foot facility with a pool but limited air conditioning, leaving spaces such as the main lobby uncomfortable in North Carolina’s heat and humidity. Many of Catawba’s older buildings face similar issues, from outdated HVAC systems to insufficient wall insulation and vapor barriers. Over the years, efforts to improve comfort in some older buildings have been scattershot, but achieving decarbonization targets now requires a more holistic approach.

“If I address the HVAC but I don’t address the envelope, I’m just heating and cooling the outside,” Volz explained. Still, there are some advantages hidden in this legacy infrastructure. Several older buildings are already connected into the campus’s original geoexchange system, which means they can connect to the new system at minimal expense — a welcome cost savings brought about by an innovative investment over 20 years ago that continues to pay off today.

Decarbonizing old and new

One of the clearest symbols of Catawba’s decarbonization efforts is its Smokestack building. A coal-fired power plant that operated from the 1950s to 1990s, the structure stood as a reminder of past dependence on dirtier, more harmful fuel sources. Today, the building is being transformed into a 10,000-square-foot student life hub and living laboratory that will be connected to the DEM and use photovoltaic panels, reaching net-zero (or better) once complete.

The Smokestack’s new design will emphasize harmony with the local environment, ensuring it will look as good as it performs. Additionally, the Smokestack is slated to be certified LEED Platinum and certified by the Living Building Challenge Core Imperative, which assesses not only energy and carbon performance, but also water use, ecology, aesthetics, material health, education, and more.

These decarbonization efforts also extend to new construction. In April 2025, the college broke ground on a three-story, 130-bed residence hall featuring a great room with a kitchenette, a community lounge, study rooms, laundry facilities, and other student amenities. The residence hall is designed to meet Passive House US certification — the most rigorous US building standard for energy efficiency, thermal comfort, moisture, and ventilation — and will tie into the DEM system.

According to Catawba, the residence hall will reduce energy use by 55 percent, heating loads by 44 percent, and cooling loads by 75 percent compared to typical North Carolina construction. Once open, the building will free up older dorms to undergo additional energy-saving renovations, creating a ripple effect of energy savings and comfort improvements. These investments help to address the growing impacts of climate change, while also improving student retention and laying the groundwork for future enrollment growth.

Learn, invest, save, repeat

Innovation at this scale comes at a cost, but the decision to move forward with the projects went beyond financial return. “When presenting this to the board, it was not just financial [return on investment],” said Ball. “It was recruitment, retention, our sustainability and carbon goals, and a big part of our deferred maintenance plan. We’re tackling carbon and deferred maintenance simultaneously.”

Catawba College President David Nelson echoed this perspective, framing it within a broader lens of stewardship. “I look at this from an angle of what I would call a ‘good economy’ as opposed to a ‘goods economy,’” he noted. “The word ‘economy’ is misconstrued. We use it to talk about money and finances, but economy is really the good stewardship of all that’s been entrusted to us — and that includes clean air, land, and water, and taking care of the people and the creatures that live on the land. My twist with a couple of our board members was to say, “It makes good financial sense, but it makes even better economic sense.’”

Of course, financing this initiative remains a practical reality, and the DEM represents a major commitment for the college. While Catawba has been fortunate to draw from endowments and generous donors, President Nelson emphasized that it’s also a testament to the college’s values and legacy that the board and leadership were willing to take on that challenge. Yet, a preliminary net present value (NPV) cost analysis suggests the risk is minimal. When compared with business-as-usual practices, NPV projections show the DEM will save the college approximately $10 million between 2025 and 2054 when considering costs associated with energy, operations and maintenance, and other factors.

Ball reinforced this point, saying that Catawba’s decades of successful sustainability experience make it feel less risky than it would on some other college campuses. He also sees this as an opportunity for Catawba to serve as a model. “When we have the ability to do this, maybe another campus could do some version of it,” he said.

“They can come here and learn, talk to our campus engineers or partners to help with design, or meet the people who are actually running the systems. We can explain to them in real time,” Ball said. “Here’s what it takes, these are the pain points, and this is what we like about it.”

Though unique for a small Southeastern college, Catawba’s solar power, geoexchange heating and cooling system, and other sustainability initiatives are an investment in its future — and a blueprint for other institutions charting their own decarbonization journeys.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20220315_Catawba_4400-e1761152619943.webp,N,,2025-12-16 11:08:37.218362

Aside from wasting a ton of money, Ford revealed they no longer plan to “produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.” This likely references today’s decision to axe the F-150 Lightning EV and eventually revive it as a range-extended pickup truck.

More: The F-150 Lightning Is Dead, But It’s Coming Back As A Range-Extended EV

The company also announced they will no longer build a previously planned electric commercial van for Europe. Plans for an electric van in North America have also been dropped, but they’re being replaced by an affordable commercial van that will offer gas and hybrid engines. This model will be built at Ford’s Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake starting in 2029.

Ford previously abandoned three-row EVs, but they’re still committed to new electric vehicles based on the Universal EV Platform. These will be small and affordable, with the first variant arriving in 2027 for around $30,000.

Besides hitting the brakes on most BEVs, Ford confirmed they’ll “expand powertrain choice” by offering more hybrids and range-extended electric vehicles. The company expects the mix of these three powertrains will be approximately 50% of its global volume by 2030, which would be up from 17% this year.

To help fuel this projected jump in demand, Ford is planning a range of different hybrids. Some will focus on fuel economy, while others chase performance. We can also expect hybrids with exportable power, which has become popular with customers.

On the range-extended side of things, Ford implied the second-generation F-150 Lightning will be joined by range-extended versions of their larger SUVs. This likely means we can expect to see electrified versions of the Expedition and Navigator.

Ford went on to say that by the end of the decade, nearly every vehicle will offer a hybrid or “multi-energy powertrain choice.”

Given the shift away from EVs, Ford is renaming the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center as the Tennessee Truck Plant. It will build new, affordable gas-powered trucks starting in 2029. This is a departure as the plant was originally supposed to build the next-generation F-150 Lightning.

Ford Battery Business

Despite throwing in the towel on most EVs, Ford announced plans to launch a battery energy storage system business. It will provides sales and service to support the electric grid and growing demand from data centers.

The pivot can partially be explained by the transition away from EVs as Ford has a lot of excess battery manufacturing capacity. As a result, they’re repurposing their Glendale, Kentucky plant to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. As part of the change, the facility will build “LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules, and 20-foot DC container systems.”

Ford also announced their BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan will make residential energy storage solutions. They’ll be built alongside LFP prismatic battery cells for models based on the Universal EV Platform.

In a statement, Ford CEO Jim Farley said “This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford.” He added, “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/F-150-Lightning_Exterior_Sketch_1-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 08:58:28.671364

New Orleans has already started adapting to that shift by using new benchmarking and transparency requirements to improve building performance.

Retail electricity prices in the United States have risen faster than inflation since 2022 and are expected to continue increasing through 2026, according to forecasts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

According to Louisiana Public Service Commission data, the average monthly electricity cost for a typical household in Louisiana using 1,000 kilowatt-hours was about 8% higher in July 2025 than in July 2024.

Commercial Property: Energy-Efficient Buildings

A recent National Association of Realtors (NAR) survey of more than 2,000 commercial real estate professionals found that businesses increasingly prioritize energy efficiency when purchasing or leasing commercial property. More than half of commercial realtors say that promoting a building’s energy efficiency adds value when listing it. About one-third reported that green building certifications increase commercial property value.

Seventy percent of respondents said utility and operations expenses are important to clients, helping explain why efficiency measures such as improved insulation, energy management systems and behind-the-meter solar installations are gaining traction.

Local Policy Push Aligns with National Trends

Those national trends are intersecting with local policy. In July, the New Orleans City Council adopted the city’s first Building Energy Benchmarking ordinance, requiring large commercial buildings to track and report annual energy use. The measure applies to buildings larger than 20,000 square feet and is a key strategy within the city’s Climate Action Plan to reduce emissions and improve efficiency.

Large commercial buildings account for roughly 20% of New Orleans’ citywide greenhouse gas emissions, according to the City’s Office of Resilience & Sustainability. City officials say benchmarking provides building owners with actionable data to identify inefficiencies, plan upgrades and manage long-term operating costs.

“Our office has been laying the groundwork for years, and we’re proud to finally launch a program that will reduce emissions, drive investment, and increase transparency across the building sector,” said Greg Nichols, director of the City of New Orleans Office of Resilience & Sustainability.

Benchmarking requirements will roll out in phases beginning Jan. 1, 2026, for properties of 50,000 square feet or more, followed by buildings between 20,000 and 50,000 square feet in 2027. Owners will report energy use through the EPA’s ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, with annual performance data published by the city to promote transparency.

Since 2012, the city has benchmarked its own municipal buildings. Between 2018 and 2021, that effort reduced municipal energy use by 23%, demonstrating the cost-saving potential of data-driven energy management. In 2025, the city launched a public Municipal Building Energy Use Dashboard that translates ENERGY STAR data into a public-facing view of performance and progress across city-owned buildings.

Grid Efficiency Workforce

A new report from the Building Performance Association found that energy efficiency is now the largest energy-related employment sector in 39 states plus the District of Columbia with job growth nearly doubling since 2021. That growth spans building retrofits, construction trades, energy auditing, engineering and smart building technologies.

Louisiana is not included in that list.

Local officials say the benchmarking ordinance is expected to help catalyze energy efficiency activity by identifying inefficient buildings and giving owners clearer data. The policy is designed to spur private investment and green job creation while improving performance in workplaces across the city.

Incentives, Market Forces and What Comes Next

In New Orleans, the benchmarking program is supported in part by a $1.5 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Climate Pollution Reduction Grant, which funds staffing, outreach and technical assistance for building owners. Penalties for noncompliance range from $1,000 to $3,000, though fines will be waived during a property’s first year of required compliance.

While broader federal climate and environmental justice funding has faced cancellations under the Trump administration, the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant supporting New Orleans’ benchmarking program remains intact for now.

Nationally, as federal energy-efficiency incentives wind down, industry leaders say market forces could continue pushing adoption. For New Orleans, the convergence of rising energy costs, national job growth in energy efficiency and new local benchmarking requirements suggests that building performance is becoming less of an environmental add-on and more of a core business issue—one tied directly to operating costs, competitiveness and long-term resilience.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/12/Energy-Efficient-Buildings-Gain-Value-as-Costs-Rise.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:02:03.947701

The PJM auction has emerged as a barometer of US energy inflation, with this week’s results likely to stoke increasingly heated public discourse about affordability. Surging utility bills are already shaping up to be an issue in the congressional midterm elections next year: Despite President Donald Trump saying electricity prices would be halved within a year of taking office, costs have increased. Just last month, Democrats won elections in New Jersey and Virginia — two states within the grid’s territory — as well as in Georgia, after campaigning to lower power bills.

While the so-called capacity auction is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s one of the fastest growing due to skyrocketing demand from artificial intelligence that’s straining power supplies. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. The limit for this month’s auction is $333.44 per megawatt per day, with analysts widely expecting prices to reach that ceiling, which would be an all-time high.

While 58% of military veterans treated between 2002 and 2015 had a diagnosed mental health disorder, less than half of U.S. vets seek out treatment due to the cost, lack of availability and stigma. In response, mental health professionals, veterans groups and researchers have sought alternatives to in-office treatment, finding positive results with outdoor recreation and exposure.

Although adventure-based trips like backpacking and whitewater rafting had a positive impact on veterans facing PTSD, anxiety, depression and other conditions, the Sierra Club report notes these programs are only available sporadically. Additionally, many areas lack the natural resources needed for this recreational therapy.

Veterans need access to quality natural spaces near their homes, the report says, emphasizing that this space should be accessible regardless of transportation availability, connection to organized outings, or their personal economic situations.

Air pollution can also complicate access to green spaces, as many veterans suffer from respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, making them more sensitive to pollutants, preventing them from engaging in outdoor activities.

The report examined eight cities across the U.S., including Detroit, assessing each based on the amount of vets lacking access to nature, as well as the American Lung Association’s 2025 state of the air grades.

In its assessment of Detroit, the report notes that its park system is growing, as it encompasses nearly 5,000 acres across 300 parks. While 84% of residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park, 20% of veterans lacked access to nature in their neighborhoods, with the Sierra Club rating the city a “B” for overall nature access.

However, the city’s “F” rating from the American Lung Association, low walkability and poor access to public transit, pose a barrier to veterans’ park access, the report notes.

Additionally, the neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of people of color also had access to 38% less park space than the neighborhoods with the most white residents. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the report gave Detroit a “D” rating overall.

With many veterans facing long-term respiratory, cardiovascular and mental health conditions that can be made worse by pollution, the Sierra Club emphasized the importance of maintaining protections for clean air, water and for public lands, to support nature-based therapy and limit further exposure of veterans to toxic air pollution.

“When parks are closed, air is polluted, or communities near bases suffer environmental damage, veterans—many of whom live in those areas—bear the brunt,” the report states. “Protecting the environment is not just an ecological responsibility; it’s part of the nation’s duty of care to those who served.”

The report also recommends supporting efforts to connect veterans with nature, supporting staffing and funding for public lands, and improving accessible infrastructure in parks and public land.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-190946.png,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:18.062640

“If you’re buying solar, you’re essentially buying all the energy you’re going to use from that system all at once.
The One Big Beautiful Bill allows companies that own the solar panels to take advantage of the commercial solar tax credit, which doesn’t expire until Dec. 31, 2027.","The massive tax and spending law signed in July halts a federal incentive for residential solar, and homeowners and installers are hurrying to complete projects before the end of the year. Industry experts say there are other ways to cut costs like “group buys.”

On their small farm in Wahoo, Nebraska, Rhonda McClure and her husband toss a few pumpkins over the fence to a flock of ewes. They sell market lambs and wool, some of which Rhonda uses as a fiber artist, along with garden produce and compost.

She said they’ve always tried to use sustainable practices on their farm, including rotational grazing, geothermal energy and most recently — solar.

“The solar just fits in with trying to be as independent and careful of the environment as we can,” McClure said.

For the McClures, harnessing energy from the sun allows them to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and keep their energy costs down over the long run.

A solar array they added in 2021 to help power their well and home reduced their summer energy bills from several hundred dollars per month to as low as $4, McClure said.

They added a solar battery this spring to release energy at night and act as a back-up during regional power outages.

“It’s provided a good deal of security for us to know that if we’re off grid for a while, if something happens, we can get by,” McClure said. “We have water and heat and the essential services here, for us and our livestock.”

Now they’re wrapping up another solar project, largely to provide air conditioning for a new outbuilding used to store and process wool, teach classes and host large groups of people.

McClure said they likely would have waited to install it next spring. But they bumped up the timeline when they found out the Residential Clean Energy Credit was rapidly expiring. Congress voted this summer to eliminate it at the end of 2025 through the One Big Beautiful Bill.

An incentive for home solar

The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.

Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush. But the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden kicked the deadline to 2032 for the full credit, followed by a rate phase down.

The Biden administration said the tax credit and two dozen others in the Inflation Reduction Act would “save families money on their energy bills and accelerate the deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and clean manufacturing.”

Over 752,000 households claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit on their 2023 taxes. Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit made solar more affordable for homeowners by lowering the upfront costs and shortening the amount of time before they recoup their initial investment, said Paul Cutting.

Cutting helps homeowners identify opportunities to improve their energy efficiency and pay for them as an energy auditor with Clean Energy Districts of Iowa. The affiliation includes 15 county-level organizations across eastern Iowa and one in Wisconsin.

The cost of installing solar depends largely on the size of the home, along with its location and overall electricity usage, Cutting said. The national average is $23,500, according to the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy, but some industry experts say some residential solar projects can exceed $40,000.

“The solar tax credit being funded at the full 30% makes it pretty enticing for a homeowner to move forward with that,” Cutting said.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill cut the tax credit deadline off at the end of the year instead of its original phase out starting in 2032. Homeowners working with contractors must have their systems installed and invoices paid by Dec. 31 to qualify.

A rush on solar

Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.

That was the experience of StraightUp Solar, a company that designs and installs solar systems for homes, businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Missouri and Illinois.

“We sold out in September, and many other solar companies were selling out in July, which means their entire build schedule was full for 2025 because people wanted to get in before the tax credit expired at the end of the year,” said Eric Schneider, director of business development for StraightUp Solar.

The company’s third quarter of 2025 was the second busiest for inquiries, said Schneider. The biggest spike was in 2022 when homeowners expected an earlier tax credit to sunset before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We call it the ‘solar coaster’ in the industry because demand fluctuates up and down,” Schneider said. “Some of it’s policy driven; some of it’s interest rate driven.”

Despite the loss of the Residential Clean Energy Credit, Schneider remains optimistic about the coming year and the future of the industry at large.

The price of solar power has fallen dramatically in the last 15 years as panels have become more efficient, increasing its appeal to homeowners concerned about rising energy bills, Schneider said.

Cutting agreed.

“I imagine there’s going to be a slowdown [in 2026], but I think solar at this point probably has a lot to stand on its own.” Cutting said.

Higher electricity rates

Inflation, higher demand, natural disasters and upgrades to aging infrastructure have driven up electricity rates across the U.S. in the last five years.

And they’re expected to continue their upward trajectory, in large part due to the acceleration of artificial intelligence. Projected growth in data centers and cryptocurrency mining could increase average electricity generation costs in the U.S. 8% by 2030, with some regions seeing increases as high as 25%, according to the Open Energy Outlook Initiative.

More utilities are also shifting to “time-of-use” or “time-of-day” pricing, which sets higher electricity rates during peak hours, typically late afternoon and evening on weekdays.

A homeowner with solar panels and a battery back-up can draw from their stored energy – rather than the grid – during peak hours to save money, Schneider said.

These customers are also insulated from future energy rate hikes, said Corey Ziemann, solar program coordinator for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association.

“If you’re buying solar, you’re essentially buying all the energy you’re going to use from that system all at once. You’re locking in that rate so you won’t be subject to the increases that are coming,” Ziemann said.

The loss of the federal tax credit will likely stretch out the payback period for homeowners, Ziemann said. But another way to help make home solar more affordable is through “group buy” programs, which bring individuals from a community together to purchase in bulk.

The Midwest Renewable Energy Association’s Grow Solar team has facilitated more than 70 group buy programs in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri. An advisory committee made up of local stakeholders and officials review bids and vote on an installer to use.

Ziemann added that it’s cheaper for an installer to have crews working in a concentrated area.

“Typically, our group buys will be about 15%-18% below market rate, and then there can be additional discounts after that,” he said.

The association helped coordinate a group buy in eastern Iowa this fall, Ziemann said, which allowed over 30 homes and businesses in Jasper and Poweshiek counties to install solar.

Schneider with StraightUp Solar also sees potential with “Power Purchase Agreements” and lease programs, which he said his company and others have started to offer. Similar to leasing a car, Schneider said the homeowner uses the solar panels without owning them.

“You’re getting all the benefits from the utility. You’re getting the net metering; you’re getting the low utility bill because you’re getting solar energy directly to your house,” Schneider said.

The Detroit-based automaker’s pivot away from large EVs and toward hybrids and extended-range EVs that come with a gas generator is proof that sustainable powertrains are easy on paper, but hard in reality.

Tesla is perhaps the biggest beneficiary of Ford’s decision, especially as it will no longer have to deal with the sole pure EV pickup that outsold it from time to time: the F-150 Lightning.

Here’s why:

Reduced Competition in the Electric Pickup Segment

The F-150 Lightning was the Tesla Cybertruck’s primary and direct rival in the full-size electric pickup market in the United States. With Ford’s decision to end pure EV production of its best-selling truck’s electric version and shifting to hybrids/EREVs, the Cybertruck faces significantly less competition.

This could drive more fleet and retail buyers toward the Cybertruck, especially those committed to fully electric vehicles without a gas generator backup.

Strengthened Market Leadership and Brand Perception in Pure EVs

Ford’s pullback from large EVs–citing unprofitability and lack of demand for EVs of that size–highlights the challenges legacy automakers face in scaling profitable battery-electric vehicles.

Tesla, as the established leader with efficient production and vertical integration, benefits from reinforced perception as the most viable and committed pure EV manufacturer.

This can boost consumer confidence in Tesla’s long-term ecosystem over competitors retreating to hybrids. With Ford making this move, it is totally reasonable that some car buyers could be reluctant to buy from other legacy automakers.

Profitability is a key reason companies build cars; they’re businesses, and they’re there to make money.

However, Ford’s new strategy could plant a seed in the head of some who plan to buy from companies like General Motors, Stellantis, or others, who could have second thoughts. With this backtrack in EVs, other things, like less education on these specific vehicles to technicians, could make repairs more costly and tougher to schedule.

Potential Increases in Market Share for Large EVs

Interestingly, this could play right into the hands of Tesla fans who have been asking for the company to make a larger EV, specifically a full-size SUV.

Customers seeking large, high-capability electric trucks or SUVs could now look to Tesla for its Cybertruck or potentially a future vehicle release, which the company has hinted at on several occasions this year.

With Ford reallocating resources away from large pure EVs and taking a $19.5 billion charge, Tesla stands to capture a larger slice of the remaining demand in this segment without a major U.S. competitor aggressively pursuing it.

Tesla’s domestic sales in China held steady in November with around 73,000 units delivered, but a closer look at the Model Y L’s numbers hints at an emerging shift towards pricier variants that could very well be boosting average selling prices and margins.

This suggests that the addition of the Model Y L to Tesla China’s lineup will not result in a case of cannibalization, but a possible case of “premiumization” instead.

Tesla China’s November domestic numbers

Data from the a Passenger Car Association (CPCA) indicated that Tesla China saw domestic deliveries of about 73,000 vehicles in November 2025. This number included 34,000 standard Model Y units, 26,000 Model 3 units, and 13,000 Model Y L units, as per industry watchers.

This means that the Model Y L accounted for roughly 27% of Tesla China’s total Model Y sales, despite the variant carrying a ~28% premium over the base RWD Model Y that is estimated to have dominated last year’s mix.

As per industry watcher @TSLAFanMtl, this suggests that Tesla China’s sales have moved towards more premium variants this year. Thus, direct year-over-year sales comparisons might miss the bigger picture. This is true even for the regular Model Y, as another premium trim, the Long Range RWD variant, was also added to the lineup this 2025.

November 2025 momentum

While Tesla China’s overall sales this year have seen challenges, the Model Y and Model 3 have remained strong sellers in the country. This is especially impressive as the Model Y and Model 3 are premium-priced vehicles, and they compete in the world’s most competitive electric vehicle market. Tesla China is also yet to roll out the latest capabilities of FSD in China, which means that its vehicles in the country could not tap into their latest capabilities yet.

Aggregated results from November suggest that the Tesla Model Y took the crown as China’s #1 best-selling SUV during the month, with roughly 34,000 deliveries. With the Model Y L, this number is even higher. The Tesla Model 3 also had a stellar month, seeing 25,700 deliveries during November 2025.

The Tesla Cybertruck has achieved the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s (IIHS) highest honor, earning a Top Safety Pick+ rating for 2025 models built after April 2025.

The full-size electric pickup truck’s safety rating is partly due to the vehicle’s strong performance in updated crash tests, superior front crash prevention, and effective headlights, among other factors. To commemorate the accolade, the official Cybertruck account celebrated the milestone on X.

Cybertruck’s IIHS rating

As per the IIHS, beginning with 2025 Cybertruck models built after April 2025, changes were made to the front underbody structure and footwell to improve occupant safety in driver-side and passenger-side small overlap front crashes. The moderate overlap front test earned a good rating, and the updated side impact test also received stellar marks.

The Cybertruck’s front crash prevention earned a good rating in pedestrian scenarios, with the standard Collision Avoidance Assist avoiding collisions in day and night tests across child, adult crossing, and parallel paths. Headlights with high-beam assist compensated for limitations, contributing to the top award.

Safest and most autonomous pickup

The Cybertruck is one of only two full-size pickups to receive the IIHS’ Top Safety Pick + rating. It is also the only one equipped with advanced self-driving features via Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system. Thanks to FSD, the Cybertruck can navigate inner city streets and highways on its own with minimal supervision, adding a layer of safety beyond passive crash protection.

Community reactions poured in, with users praising the vehicle’s safety rating amidst skepticism from critics. Tesla itself highlighted this by starting its X post with a short clip of a Cybertruck critic who predicted that the vehicle will likely not pass safety tests. The only question now is, of course, if the vehicle’s Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS will help the Cybertruck improve its sales.

Ford is canceling the all-electric F-150 Lightning and also announced it would take a $19.5 billion charge as it aims to quickly restructure its strategy regarding electrification efforts, a massive blow for the Detroit-based company that was once one of the most gung-ho on transitioning to EVs.

The announcement comes as the writing on the wall seemed to get bolder and more identifiable. Ford was bleeding money in EVs and, although it had a lot of success with the all-electric Lightning, it is aiming to push its efforts elsewhere.

It will also restructure its entire strategy on EVs, and the Lightning is not the only vehicle getting the boot. The T3 pickup, a long-awaited vehicle that was developed in part of a skunkworks program, is also no longer in the company’s plans.

Instead of continuing on with its large EVs, it will now shift its focus to hybrids and “extended-range EVs,” which will have an onboard gasoline engine to increase traveling distance, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs, and regulatory changes,” the company said in a statement.

While unfortunate, especially because the Lightning was a fantastic electric truck, Ford is ultimately a business, and a business needs to make money.

Ford has lost $13 billion on its EV business since 2023, and company executives are more than aware that they gave it plenty of time to flourish.

Andrew Frick, President of Ford, said:

“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher returning areas, more trucks and van hybrids, extended range electric vehicles, affordable EVs, and entirely new opportunities like energy storage.”

CEO Jim Farley also commented on the decision:

“Instead of plowing billions into the future knowing these large EVs will never make money, we are pivoting.”

Farley also said that the company now knows enough about the U.S. market “where we have a lot more certainty in this second inning.”",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tesla-cybertruck-display-logo-1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:35.532618

The 2026 CAP Implementation Grant application round resulted in 222 approved projects that counties may complete over the next 12 to 24 months, resulting in an estimated reduction of more than 113,493 pounds/year of nitrogen, 28,816 pounds/year of phosphorus, and 11.8 million pounds/year of sediment delivered to the Chesapeake Bay. Pennsylvania has reduced more than 10 times the amount of nitrogen in the past five years than in the previous 10 years, and water quality monitoring data show significant improvements in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment levels.

“Pennsylvania’s clean water successes are rooted in collaboration — state, local, federal, legislative, and non-governmental partners, and of course landowners,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “The work will continue to evolve, and our focus will remain on setting our collaborative partnerships up for success well beyond 2025. The momentum is real, and you can see it in our improved water quality.”

On Tuesday, Dec. 2, Governor Josh Shapiro was unanimously selected to serve a one-year term as chair of the Chesapeake Executive Council, marking the first time in 20 years that Pennsylvania has assumed leadership of the bipartisan body. The Chesapeake Executive Council is composed of the Governors of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting, the Chesapeake Executive Council also approved the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. The refreshed Watershed Agreement commits signatories to address nutrient and sediment goals and outcomes by 2040, with a midpoint assessment in 2033, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the Chesapeake Bay Program. Under the Shapiro Administration, Pennsylvania has accelerated progress toward its clean water goals by investing new financial resources, targeting high-performing pollution reduction strategies, implementing innovative technical solutions, listening to local leaders and stakeholders, and providing sustained support to implement county-based action plans.

The 2025 CAP Implementation Grants include $9.5 million from the state Environmental Stewardship Fund and $6.2 million in federal funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including $1.1 million in Local Government Implementation (LGI) Funds for project implementation in the Octoraro Watershed in Chester and Lancaster counties. The LGI projects will be reported to support pollution reduction goals under the multi-jurisdictional Conowingo Watershed Implementation Plan, which aims to reduce pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Conowingo Dam reservoir.

Through an innovative new arrangement, the block grant funding model of the CAP Implementation Grant has enabled DEP’s Bureau of Clean Water to provide $100,000 of 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds to Mifflin County in support of restoration of the Town Run Watershed and $114,000 of federal Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grant funding through the Bureau of Watershed Restoration and Nonpoint Source Management for restoration efforts in the Hammer Creek Watershed. This is the first time the 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds have been targeted through a partnership between DEP programs toward the Countywide Action Plans.

Nutrient pollution and eroded sediment enter streams, rivers, and lakes from a range of human activities on land, including overapplication of fertilizer, plowing and tilling farm fields, stripping away trees and vegetation, and increasing paved surfaces.

Along with state and sector efforts, CAPs are a key component of Pennsylvania’s Chesapeake Bay Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan to reduce this pollution. All 34 counties that were asked to develop a CAP are currently engaged in implementing their CAPs.

The Phase 3 WIP takes a Healthy Waters, Healthy Communities approach, inviting county teams to take control of local water quality improvement, with state and other partners providing as much data, technical assistance, funding, and other support as possible. It encourages and equips counties to develop strategies and determine project sites and types that will benefit their communities and farmers, municipalities, businesses, and other landowners, while restoring the environment.

Countywide action teams have implemented a diverse range of projects and initiatives in the Chesapeake Bay watershed since 2021, including not only stream restorations, streambank tree plantings, rain gardens, and livestock crossing installations, but also a rapid stream delisting strategy, which aims to delist pollution-impaired streams from Pennsylvania’s list of agriculturally-impaired waterways by the year 2030.

What Comes Next The surge in megaproject construction is expected to continue shaping industry trends through 2026 and beyond, particularly in data centers, semiconductor manufacturing and energy export facilities.","A new wave of massive construction investments totaling hundreds of billions of dollars is preparing to break ground across the United States in 2026, signaling continued momentum in megaproject development even as broader construction markets face headwinds.

At least 10 projects valued at more than $1 billion each are scheduled to begin construction next year, spanning advanced manufacturing, energy production, transportation infrastructure and digital development. These large-scale ventures are expected to generate thousands of jobs while reinforcing U.S. competitiveness in strategically important industries.

As traditional commercial and residential construction shows signs of strain, megaprojects—defined as developments typically costing $1 billion or more—are increasingly serving as critical growth drivers. However, they also underscore ongoing challenges related to labor shortages, supply-chain constraints and shifting industrial priorities.

Recent data from the Dodge Construction Network (DCN) shows that investment growth remains heavily concentrated in a limited number of sectors, even as activity in others remains sluggish. These projects reflect a blend of federal, state and private investment and point to long-term bets on domestic manufacturing, clean energy and digital infrastructure.

Major Megaprojects Starting in 2026

Among the most significant developments is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s $165 billion investment in Arizona, which includes three advanced fabrication plants and a research and development center. The initiative is designed to strengthen domestic chip production and support next-generation semiconductor technologies.

In Texas, GlobalWafers plans to invest $7.5 billion to build the nation’s first 300mm silicon wafer manufacturing facility, aimed at securing a domestic supply of materials critical for advanced chip production used in artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and 5G technologies.

Arizona will also host a $5.5 billion manufacturing complex from LG Energy Solution focused on electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems, supporting the expanding EV and renewable energy markets.

Louisiana is set to see multiple large-scale investments, including a $5.8 billion ultra-low-carbon steel manufacturing plant using Electric Arc Furnace technology, as well as a $15.1 billion liquefied natural gas export terminal and pipeline project designed to expand U.S. energy exports.

In Tennessee, the multibillion-dollar Kingston Energy Complex will combine natural gas generation, battery storage and solar power, marking the retirement of nine coal-fired units and a major shift in regional energy infrastructure.

Transportation infrastructure will also see major investment, led by Brightline West’s more than $21 billion high-speed rail project connecting Las Vegas and Southern California. The rail line is expected to remove millions of cars from Interstate 15 each year while reducing congestion and emissions.

Maryland’s Northeast Corridor will benefit from a $5.9 billion modernization of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel, expanding capacity and improving reliability for millions of Amtrak passengers through new tracks, signaling and ventilation systems.

Digital infrastructure remains a dominant driver of megaproject growth. Meta is investing $7.5 billion in the Hyperion Data Centre in Louisiana, a multi-building campus spanning more than 1.4 million square feet. Amazon is also planning a $15 billion data center expansion in Indiana, which is expected to create more than 1,000 construction jobs and hundreds of permanent technology positions.

Industry Perspective

Sarah Martin, associate director of forecasting at DCN, said: ""Much of the momentum we’re seeing is still concentrated in big-ticket, high-tech projects. Outside those categories, the pace of expansion is noticeably steadier and more restrained.""

She added: ""Growth in construction starts continued to be propped up by high-value megaproject activity last month. Outside of these high-tech buildings, however, growth appears more moderate. In square footage terms, for example, nonresidential and residential starts declined by 4.3 percent over the month, and are down 5.4 percent year-to-date through October.""

Douglas Schrift, global head of infrastructure at Liberty Mutual, highlighted how rapidly the market has evolved, saying: ""Just three or four years ago, billion-dollar projects were rare. Now we see multiple projects of that size every month, and they continue to grow.""

What Comes Next

The surge in megaproject construction is expected to continue shaping industry trends through 2026 and beyond, particularly in data centers, semiconductor manufacturing and energy export facilities. However, experts caution that this growth remains uneven, with broader commercial, healthcare, education and smaller institutional projects lagging behind.

Long-term success for these developments will depend on the construction industry’s ability to address skilled labor shortages, manage supply-chain logistics and mitigate environmental impacts associated with large-scale builds.",,N,,2025-12-16 09:00:19.067458

Most CTF spending is directed toward programmes without a clear social focus or into broad-based relief measures that tend to benefit higher-income households and businesses, the institute said in its review of budget plans for 2025 and 2026.

Socially targeted measures – such as income-tiered building renovation schemes, household energy-efficiency advice or the government's planned electric vehicle subsidy for low- and middle-income households – account for just 14 percent of expenditure, the analysis found.

The report also points to a shift in spending priorities in 2026 towards short-term energy price relief, while the share of investment spending is set to decline sharply and then stagnate. According to the think tank, such measures disproportionately benefit households and companies with high energy consumption and higher incomes.

The CTF is a central financing tool for Germany's efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reach climate neutrality by 2045. It is funded primarily through revenues from Germany's national carbon price on transport and heating, proceeds from the sale of EU emissions allowances under the Emissions Trading System (ETS), and transfers from a debt-financed 500-billion-euro fund for infrastructure and climate neutrality.

A recent analysis by the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) of 2024 data found that poorer households are proportionally more burdened by Germany's national carbon price on transport and heating, even though they cause considerably fewer emissions than more affluent groups in society.

Zukunft KlimaSozial said a socially balanced design of the fund was essential, noting that low- and middle-income households are particularly sensitive to rising energy and living costs.

Sure, thanks for having me. I think the only thing that's really surprising is the magnitude. The 19.5 billion is is larger than we would expect. Um, I think uh it was a 8 billion of that was was related to EVs. I don't think it's a surprise. I think most investors have anticipated this. So I do agree with the uh takeaway. It's sort of a rip the band off bandaid off moment. Um, we saw General Motors take a uh charge of 1.6 billion back in October related to their EV assets. And really, it this became inevitable as soon as the federal EV tax credit uh went away at the end of September. Um, you know, EV companies looking at, um, you know, taking impairment charges related to their EV assets. And, um, overall, I think what we're what we've seen in the market is is all positive for Ford. Their US vehicle lineup is entirely comprised of trucks and SUVs at this point, aside from the Ford Mustang. So that's the only model they still produce that's not a truck or SUV. Um so they benefit from lower uh oil, lower oil and gas prices and uh declining interest rates. So they're they're really the big winner, and they didn't make as much of a bet on EVs as General Motors did. They took more of a balanced approach between EV, hybrid and uh internal combustion engine vehicle. And and Ford has done very well with their with their hybrids. So there's a lot of reason for optimism when looking at some of the hybrid models they have.

So reasons for optimism, but but Garrett, you still have a hold on this name, correct? Why, why are you still on the sidelines, Garrett?

Texas has attracted a significant number of data and AI centers, second only to Virginia.
However, the Solar Energy Industries Association has concerns.
Fortunately, and according to Cleanview’s project tracker in November, politics are not slowing down renewable energy projects.
Hopefully, this could mitigate forecast energy cost increases over time.","Google’s announcement last month that it plans to construct three new data centers in Texas at a cost of $40 billion is the latest in a series of new projects proposed over the next few years.

At the present time, there are 375 data centers already operating in Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, with another 70 currently under construction, according to research and advisory firm Baxtel.

Texas has attracted a significant number of data and AI centers, second only to Virginia. The state offers relatively cheap energy, great expanses of land and a business-friendly economic environment.

However, these facilities are power hungry. This either places more pressure on electrical grids already burdened with regular demand or means the centers themselves need to come up with their own power plan. That’s what Google intends to do.

“Google is committed to responsibly growing its infrastructure by bringing new energy resources onto the grid, paying for costs associated with its operations, and supporting community energy efficiency initiatives,” the company said. “In Texas, this includes a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to scale and accelerate energy initiatives, along with more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity contracted to date through power purchase agreements with energy developers.”

However, it’s not clear whether all the new data centers and AI facilities planned for Texas will be self-powering. Some may be hybrids like the Stargate project near Abilene, which will draw power from its own natural gas generator as well as from the grid.

In September 2024, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the independent, non-profit organization that operates most of the state’s electric grid, was reportedly tracking 56 gigawatts in large load interconnection requests. That number almost quadrupled to 205 gigawatts one year later.

Kristi Hobbs, ERCOT’s vice-president of system planning and weatherization, told a Public Utility Commission of Texas meeting in October the increased volume of the energy demand from large data centers, particularly those serving artificial intelligence, will require an adjustment of the planning processes to keep the grid reliable.

The demand increase is likely to cause concern among traditional Texas consumers. Summer heat results in peak power demands. Back in July, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said electricity prices for Texas residential customers and businesses were 24 per cent below the national average. In the current environment of data center growth, the cost of electricity is almost certain to increase significantly.

“The sharpest jump will occur in the ERCOT-North hub in Texas, where prices are forecast to surge 45 per cent due to high summer demand paired with limited supply,” writes Brien Sheahan, former chairman and CEO of the Illinois Commerce Commission. “While natural gas prices remain a major driver of power costs, the EIA notes that Texas’ 2026 increases reflect large hourly price spikes.”

The state needs to pull out all the stops in order to meet future forecast demands and renewable energy sources appear to be doing the job.

Sean Kelly, co-founder and CEO of energy forecasting company Amperon, writes over the last four years, ERCOT’s solar capacity had increased by more than 200 per cent. One reason is that renewables such as wind and solar can come online far faster than traditional natural gas power plants. Kelly also notes since solar has no fuel costs, it operates at a low marginal cost, thus pushing market prices down.

However, the Solar Energy Industries Association has concerns. It says the Donald Trump administration “is using every tool at its disposal to slow down solar and storage projects,” and that “under Washington’s new energy permitting bureaucracy, projects large and small are being trapped in limbo.”

It estimates Texas alone accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the at-risk projects. Further data suggests due to insufficient transmission capability, eight TWh of solar and wind power in Texas was curtailed in 2024.

Fortunately, and according to Cleanview’s project tracker in November, politics are not slowing down renewable energy projects. There were 877 solar projects alone under development in Texas. In fact, as of August, ERCOT reported five times the number of solar and wind interconnection requests versus natural gas.

“Combined, wind and solar can now supply up to nearly half of ERCOT’s total electricity demand, which makes the market less reactive to increases in the cost of natural gas,” Kelly continues.

Renewables and accompanying battery storage also help to stabilize supply during peak periods or disruptions of fuel supplies to traditional power plants.

Hopefully, this could mitigate forecast energy cost increases over time. The continued growth of renewables in Texas is the best outcome for all concerned. As Kelly warns, if supply is pinched and electricity costs do in fact increase as much as some are forecasting, those data centers won’t be coming to Texas at all, unless they find the added investment capital to somehow power themselves.

Kelly’s conclusion is compelling.

“The highly politicized national energy debates are missing the point. It’s not about ideology; it’s about doing what works. And what works in Texas is competition, consumer choice and resources that prove their worth economically. If we continue to let data — not dogma — drive energy decisions here, Texas will be fine, and we might just show the rest of the country a thing or two in the process.”",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/Stargate-Abilene-Open-AI-StargateMainWEB-US.png,N,,2025-12-16 07:57:32.681469

The US car giant cut back electric vehicle (EV) production, including the production of large battery-powered pickup trucks, because of a slump in demand from drivers.

Ford said “lower than expected” uptake of EVs had resulted in billions in losses.

Instead, the Detroit carmaker will plough more into building conventional trucks and vans and cheaper EVs, as well as launching a new battery energy storage business.

The $19.5bn writedown, announced to Wall Street on Monday, is one of the largest financial hits suffered by a carmaker to date as bets on EVs turn sour in the face of plummeting demand.

Ford’s writedown includes $6bn to close a joint venture with South Korean company SK Group. The duo had planned to build a massive battery factory in Kentucky to propel Ford’s EV vision but the plan has now been scrapped.

Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, said: “This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford.

“The operating reality has changed and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities”

The move comes amid a major regulatory shift after Donald Trump, the US president, weakened rules on carmakers to cut emissions.

Mr Trump has also ended $7,500 tax credits for drivers who buy EVs, suppressing demand across the US.

He has claimed without citing evidence that pro-EV policies brought in by Joe Biden, his Democratic predecessor, have driven up costs and prices while making cars “much worse”.

Ford said the majority of changes will take place in the fourth quarter, with a payment of about $5.5bn in cash to be paid mostly next year and the remainder being covered in 2027.

The company said it will continue to produce smaller, more affordable EVs instead of larger models.

Despite the move, Ford said it was raising its guidance for earnings this year to about $7bn, which is in line with a target set earlier in the year.

“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, the head of Ford’s EV unit.

Still, the carmaker foresees about 50pc of its global volume to be in hybrid vehicles, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030 – up from 17pc this year.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/12/16/TELEMMGLPICT000453641356_17658770425760_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5PHEjWUEYlSXIGf8T4kkZJwQOpIpveak-x4Rpo0__g8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:46.686591

If your eyes glaze over at the mention of the proposed zoning changes in Detroit, you are not alone.

Residents who have tried to make sense of the proposed changes have said they find them confusing, with too many being put forward at the same time. Even the Detroit City Council has struggled. The proposals hit councilmembers’ desks back in November, and that’s where they remain despite having top billing during an eight-hour-long end-of-year session.

Here’s the one-sentence summary: The changes would update zoning in residential neighborhoods to allow more types of development and make it easier to redevelop civic buildings.

Here’s the longer version: The “tactical preservation” proposal removes barriers to redeveloping civic buildings like libraries, fire stations and schools, allowing for them to be adapted into uses like child care centers and laundromats.

The “let’s build more housing” proposal would allow for more types of housing and make it easier to develop, so most neighborhoods can build units like “granny flats” or “backyard bungalows.”

City Council said it would dive back into the ordinances in January. As always, we’ll keep you updated. And if you have any questions, email kiran@outliermedia.org.

Detroit’s new zoning changes, explained

by Aaron Mondry

A new batch of proposals that would update Detroit zoning laws have caused some confusion. Here’s what to know.

🌡️ Faulty towers: City officials say a temporary boiler is up and running at Alden Towers. Parts of the riverfront apartment complex have had heat problems all season. The property has racked up more than $8,000 in blight tickets in the past three weeks. A spokesperson for Detroit’s Buildings, Safety, Engineering and Environmental Department said it’s inspecting temperatures, but tenants should report persistent problems by using the city’s website. (Metro Times, City of Detroit)

💔 Rebuilding again: Hitha Healing House, a maternal health nonprofit in Grixdale Farms, is now closed after a house fire. The healing house branded itself as a community hub for Black maternal health and wellness, offering classes on childbirth, meditation, massage and more. No one was injured in the fire or living in the house at the time. The owner is looking to raise money to support reconstruction of the space, which provides employment for 12 practitioners. (BridgeDetroit)

🗣️ Emily’s a big talker: Detroit’s Department of Neighborhoods is testing an artificial intelligence customer service agent in Districts 3 and 4, with the goal of answering questions about basic neighborhood services. But “Emily” is apparently more than a bit confused about whom it’s serving and why.

Outlier called the number listed for District 4 manager Nicholas Barnes and spoke with the AI agent for seven minutes. We asked, “When is the last day for curbside pickup of yard waste?”, and, “How often does my street get salted?” Emily’s answer for both questions: Contact the Department of Public Works, which handles such matters. The bot said the staff there would know the answer, but it didn’t know their phone number. Instead, it referred us to the city’s well-known detroitmi.gov where we could find it for ourselves.

When asked what kinds of questions she could answer, Emily said it could connect us with District 3 events and resources, or take reports of blight and other issues to file with the appropriate department. After clarifying that we called District 4, the agent admitted it’s only programmed to be in-the-know about District 3 and said there must be a routing error with the District 4 phone number — which it would report. Though fun and friendly, the conversation was not exactly helpful. We want to know so much more, like who folks in D4 should call now that Emily is answering the phones.

🚔 Where are the ShotSpotter sensors? Detroit Police and city officials have no idea where the city’s gunshot detection sensors are. Detroit police officials told ShotSpotter staff the high gunfire areas they wanted covered — but did not get the exact locations of the sensors. The city’s $7 million contract for the program is up for renewal in June: Detroit Mayor-elect Mary Sheffield and Chief Todd Bettison will have to decide whether to continue the program. In 2022, Sheffield voted no on the ShotSpotter contract. Board of Police Commissioner Linda Bernard said the location of the sensors could be used as a tactic in the contract renegotiation process.

💨 Air decision: Environmental advocates celebrated a federal appeals court ruling declaring Detroit’s air quality was worse than officials claimed. The decision will likely mean stricter pollution controls for facilities including auto painting operations, asphalt mixers and certain processes at refineries, with changes potentially coming within a year, an official said. (Planet Detroit)

❌ Bah, humbug: Just in time for the holidays, state House Republicans slashed (paywalled) well over a half-billion dollars in approved spending — to the dismay of pregnant moms, kids undergoing cancer treatment and others. State House Speaker Matt Hall said the cuts — carried out through an obscure provision in state law — aim to rein in state spending. They happened so fast that policymakers and organizations are still trying to figure out exactly what spending is canceled. Merry, merry! (Detroit Free Press, Bridge Michigan)

Fifty years ago, Detroit approved another water rate hike

by Michael Jackman

In 1975, rising costs convinced the Detroit Metropolitan Water Department to support a 39% increase in water rates for Detroiters and residents of 95 suburbs. The measure would raise typical Detroit water bills from $5.16 per quarter to $7.17 per quarter starting May 1. This came after a sewage rate hike took effect Sept. 1, tripling Detroiters’ sewerage bills, with varying hikes hitting suburbanites. The Detroit Free Press reported the water hike could raise Detroiters’ combined water and sewage bills as high as almost $49.56 a year. (That’s approximately $300 in 2025 dollars. Recently, a typical monthly Detroit water and sewerage bill for a family of four was about $112 per month, or about $1,340 a year.)

The company plans to use its EV battery manufacturing capacity in the country for large-scale energy storage systems to power data centers.

The automaker plans to convert its Glendale, Kentucky, facility to produce large-scale energy storage systems, creating a new revenue stream alongside vehicle manufacturing.

The battery storage systems will start shipping in 2027, and Ford plans to build 20GWh of annual capacity in this initiative. The company plans to inject roughly $2 billion to scale this business in the upcoming two years.

What’s in the plan?

According to the official source, the US automaker will convert its Kentucky site to build advanced battery energy storage systems larger than five megawatt-hours. This initiative includes the kind of hardware used by data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial companies – LFP prismatic cells, BESS modules, and 20-foot DC container systems.

Ford will aim to bring the initial production online within 18 months, leaning on its manufacturing experience and licensed battery technology.

The move follows a joint venture disposition agreement reached last week between Ford, SK On, SK Battery America, and BlueOval SK. Under the agreement, a Ford subsidiary will independently own and operate the Kentucky battery plants, while SK On will fully own and operate the Tennessee battery plant.

A new opportunity

Lisa Drake, Vice President of technology platform programs and EV systems at Ford, revealed how commercial grid customers will be a new opportunity for the new business. However, data centers will be secondary, and Ford will probably offer some home storage products.

“It was clear when we went out to the market that the technology of choice for most of these customers was an LFP prismatic type of container system,” Drake said.

“And given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the U.S., you couple that with our manufacturing experience over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us,” she continued.

A holistic strategy

Separately, the company will use its BlueOval Battery Park, Michigan, facility to produce smaller cells for residential energy storage and an upcoming midsize electric truck starting in 2026.

However, there will be one change at the Michigan factory, Ford revealed. The site will also produce smaller Amp-hour cells for residential energy storage, indicating the strategy will extend beyond commercial customers.

BlueOval Battery Park Michigan has seen multiple changes since it was announced. In February 2023, Ford pledged a $3.5 billion investment to build the plant to produce LFP batteries for its expanding electric vehicle lineup.

Construction was paused in September 2023, and two months later, Ford revealed a scaled-down plan, reducing the facility’s capacity to 20 gigawatt-hours, about 43 percent less than originally planned.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ford-headquarters.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 08:58:33.270277

Deep winter greenhouses (DWGs) and geodesic dome greenhouses (GDGs) are promising systems for extending the growing season and supporting local food production in cold northern areas. Both systems use low-energy, passive designs to reduce heating needs while maintaining suitable growing conditions for crops.

Deep winter greenhouses fit the bill for frigid Midwestern winters

The Deep Winter Greenhouse (DWG) design, developed by University of Minnesota Extension (https://tinyurl.com/24v5jcep), features an insulated structure with a south-facing glazing wall at a 60° angle to efficiently capture sunlight, even on the shortest days of winter. Daytime heat is stored by funneling warm greenhouse air through a thermal mass of rock under the structure. At night, the rock gradually releases heat to maintain stable greenhouse temperatures, eliminating the need for supplemental winter heating.

As DWGs have been operating successfully across Minnesota, we recently tested how the DWG design would perform under Wisconsin conditions using computer simulations. In winter, average air temperatures are about 17 °F in Minnesota (Cook County) and 23 °F in Wisconsin (Grant County). Although outdoor temperatures often fall below freezing, soil temperatures at a depth of 40 inches, where the rock bed is located, remain above freezing (36.9 °F in Minnesota and 39.6 °F in Wisconsin).

Since both states receive similar levels of solar radiation during winter, DWGs have strong potential for crop production during Wisconsin’s cold winters. In summer, well-insulated DWG structures trap excessive heat, leading to interior temperatures over 95 °F. Ventilation fans are needed to remove hot air to maintain a suitable summer growing environment. Solar-powered ventilation systems provide renewable energy options for ventilation and air movement in DWGs.

Design of geodesic dome greenhouses offers many benefits

Geodesic dome greenhouses (GDGs) offer another design option. A dome’s aerodynamic, spherical shape minimizes heat loss and maximizes wind tolerance, while providing uniform light distribution. An important feature of geodesic dome greenhouses is an above-ground pond for heat storage. The design takes advantage of seasonal variation in the sun’s angle.

During winter, low-angle sunlight falls on the insulated north wall, reflecting light toward the pond and warming it up. The pond’s stored heat is gradually released at night, warming the greenhouse. In summer, when the sun is higher in the sky, the north wall remains shaded, preventing excessive warming.

In addition to the pond, the system also uses a fan to draw air from the pond area through pipes buried under raised beds along the greenhouse perimeter. This circulation pathway transfers stored heat into the soil, promoting stable root-zone conditions during colder periods. In summary, although GDGs do not eliminate heating needs entirely, they provide a substantial reduction during winter and contribute to more stable energy use throughout the year.

The AEPS is meant to boost the total supply of energy generation by requiring electricity suppliers to generate their electricity from a broad array of sources – including clean energy sources.
Adding to Pennsylvania’s energy crunch is the glacially slow pace at which new energy production sources are added to the grid.","From the industrial revolution to the digital revolution, Pennsylvania has led the way in American energy production. But now it’s clear that the AI-fueled tech industry boom is poised to push our electrical grid to the brink.

The question is: Will Pennsylvania keep its place as America’s energy leader? Or will we fall behind our neighboring states and leave consumers stuck with sky-high electric bills in the process?

Pennsylvania is already starting to lose its grip as the region’s leading power player. Our neighboring states are making moves that could position them ahead of us – especially in nuclear energy.

Now that Pennsylvania is officially out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), there can be no more excuses for sitting on the sidelines of the new nuclear energy production surge.

To be sure, there are some exciting developments in Pennsylvania nuclear news.

Three Mile Island Unit 1 is gearing up to restart under the new name of Crane Clean Energy Center – ironically getting new life entirely because of the AI boom, as Microsoft has an exclusive deal to purchase the more than 800 megawatts of electricity that the plant will generate and add to the regional power grid.

But traditional nuclear power plants are a part of the energy puzzle. Pennsylvania needs to add new capacity to the electric grid, and that means fostering investment in exciting new clean energy sources – from advanced nuclear, such as small modular reactors (SMR) to geothermal and carbon-capture technologies.

The Pennsylvania House of Representatives recently took a great first step when it passed legislation to reduce fees for SMRs, to align those fees with the size of SMR projects and make them more financially feasible to develop across the commonwealth.

Why SMRs? To put it simply, they are smaller, safer, more flexible and faster to build than traditional nuclear reactors – at a fraction of the upfront costs.

Other states are already betting big on new nuclear – both SMRs and advanced versions of large reactors – to help address surging electricity demand and spiking prices. New York has a goal of adding 1 gigawatt of clean energy to the grid through advanced nuclear, while Maryland is working on nuclear production incentives.

Pennsylvania needs new energy sources, but our laws and regulations are simply not keeping up with today’s technologies.

As an example, Pennsylvania’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) are woefully outdated. The AEPS is meant to boost the total supply of energy generation by requiring electricity suppliers to generate their electricity from a broad array of sources – including clean energy sources.

But missing from the AEPS list is nuclear power – both traditional and advanced reactors – a major clean energy source that will be needed to boost grid capacity.

Also missing: carbon capture. If carbon capture was added to Pennsylvania’s AEPS, natural gas producers would be incentivized to add it to their projects, resulting in cleaner wells and a new, clean energy source.

Adding to Pennsylvania’s energy crunch is the glacially slow pace at which new energy production sources are added to the grid. That’s due in part to the red tape involved with getting large-scale energy projects approved. We need energy siting reform to streamline the permitting process and get more energy projects approved and online as fast as possible.

Pennsylvania consumers and businesses are already feeling the pinch of rising electricity rates, and we know prices are expected to keep going up at an alarming rate.

For years, our elected leaders in Harrisburg have pointed to the political debate and ensuing legal battle over RGGI as the reason why Pennsylvania couldn’t move forward with a real strategy for boosting energy production. Well, RGGI is gone. So now what?

We are well past time for Pennsylvania to have a robust and nation-leading energy strategy that will compete not just with our neighboring states but with other nations around the globe.

The roadmap is there. Now we just need our elected leaders in Harrisburg to take the wheel, put their foot on the pedal, and drive us to energy dominance.

The proposal currently is open for public comment.

Some environmental advocates say they’re concerned fast-tracking these permits for data centers will leave out reviews that ensure public health and safety. The Ohio EPA says the move is necessary to accommodate important social and economic development.

Ohio EPA issues draft general permit for data centers

Ohio has more than 200 data centers, according to Data Center Map. They are warehouses filled with computer equipment that generates a lot of heat. To cool down the computers, data centers use massive amounts of water.

If data centers want to get rid of that water after it’s been used, they have to apply for a permit called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) through the Ohio EPA. University of Cincinnati College of Law Professor Brad Mank says the permits regulate and limit the amount of pollution any manufacturer can discharge into waters like the Ohio River.

Currently, data centers must apply for an individual NPDES permit, which is detailed and unique to its operations.

That could soon change. The Ohio EPA has issued a draft general NPDES permit for wastewater and stormwater discharges from data centers, which covers facilities with similar operations and types of discharge.

In an emailed statement, the Ohio EPA said it aims “to provide a streamlined permit application and approval process for sites that are generally consistent in their potential discharges and environmental impact.”

Several other types of businesses are regulated through general permits, such as dry cleaners.

An expedited permitting process

Mank, the UC Law professor, says applying for a general permit is designed to be an expedited process.

“General permits make it a lot easier for industry to operate without many restrictions — they basically have uniform restrictions that apply to everybody,” Mank said. “So, they can basically send a postcard saying, ‘We're operating our business,’ and that's all they have to do.”

Under the general permit, eligible data centers would have to submit a notice of intent form before discharging pollutants like heavy metals and corrosion inhibitors into waterways. Several discharges associated with data centers would not be authorized by the general permit, like discharges located within 500 yards upstream of a public water supply surface water intake.

Mank says having a simplified permitting process could draw more data center developers to Ohio over other states.

“We'd be seen as one of the states that's making it easier for data centers to operate, because one of the big things they need to do is use lots of water,” Mank said. “So, if it's relatively easy to use the water without a lot of restrictions, that would mean, if I'm thinking about where I'm siting a data center, Ohio would be included on my list of states that are data center friendly.”

In an emailed statement, the Ohio EPA said, “The general permit includes the same or more monitoring and reporting requirements compared to an individual NPDES permit.”

Data center developers already are incentivized to build in Ohio by state and local tax breaks.

Environmental advocates raise concerns

Some environmental advocates are voicing concerns over the proposed change.

Save Ohio Parks, an organization advocating for the end of fracking on public land, says it is worried water quality would suffer.

The Ohio EPA wrote in its draft general permit, “It has been determined that a lowering of water quality of various waters of the state associated with granting coverage under this permit is necessary to accommodate important social and economic development in the state of Ohio.”

In a blog post published Dec. 14, Save Ohio Parks wrote, “General permits are intended for situations of minimal environmental impact. Yet this general permit says up front that it will result in lower water quality. That’s not acceptable!”

The organization also says it’s concerned that the general permit does not consider the variety of sizes, designs and locations of data centers, and that it does not mention forever chemicals, also known as PFAS, which data centers often use in their cooling systems.

The agency says the draft permit will be issued as a final action unless the director revises it after considering the record of a public hearing or written comments, or upon disapproval by the Administrator of the U.S. EPA.

How to weigh in

The draft wastewater general permit for data centers is currently open for comment. You can submit a written comment via the Ohio EPA’s online comment portal through Dec. 17.

The Ohio EPA also is holding a public hearing Dec. 17 at 2:30 p.m. both virtually and in-person in Columbus at the Lazarus Government Center, 6th Floor Conference Room A (Autumn Room), 50 West Town Street, Suite 700.

The Detroit automaker said it will cancel plans for select larger EVs — including its F-150 Lightning — due to weak demand, elevated costs and regulatory changes, marking a significant shift in strategy as the industry grapples with slower-than-expected electric vehicle adoption.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” CEO Jim Farley said.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.”

The shift by Ford comes just days after President Donald Trump moved to revoke tougher fuel-economy standards put in place by his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, which had prompted US companies to embrace a transition to electric vehicles.

Farley at the time praised Trump for “aligning fuel economy standards with market realities,” calling it “a win for customers and common sense.”

Trump has railed against what he calls an EV “mandate,” while Republicans in Congress have repealed clean-energy tax credits that had also stoked demand for EVs.

Remaining EV efforts at Ford will now concentrate on a family of smaller, affordable electric vehicles, instead of higher-cost larger vehicles.

Ford said it had halted production of the current F-150 Lightning electric pickup, which it once hoped would spearhead a transition to EVs.

Instead, the next-generation Lightning will be hybrid, combining battery power with a gasoline engine, offering an estimated 700-plus mile range, the company said.

Ford also canceled plans for new electric commercial vans in Europe and North America, replacing them with gas and hybrid models to be manufactured at its Ohio assembly plant starting in 2029.

In the shift, the company will repurpose its Tennessee facility, renaming the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center to Tennessee Truck Plant, to build new affordable gas-powered trucks beginning in 2029 instead of electric vehicles.

Ford said it was also launching a battery energy storage business, converting a Kentucky plant to manufacture products for data centers and power companies.

For that business, the company plans to invest roughly $2 billion over two years and is targeting a supply of 20 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity by late 2027, enough to make it a major player in the fast-growing market.",https://www.macaubusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mb-logo@2x.png,N,,2025-12-16 08:59:05.621297

The all-electric Lightning is dead; the extended-range Lightning is on its way.
The all-electric F-150 Lightning was a big deal to Ford.
And it was the best-selling electric truck in America last quarter, Ford says.","Ford Motor Company has ceased production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, its flagship full-size electric pickup, and will focus instead on hybrid vehicles and a future line of smaller, cheaper EVs. Battery plants once intended to supply Ford trucks will now be sending batteries to bolster the electric grid instead.

Ford says the move is following customer demand, and reflecting the reality that the all-electric Lightning was a money-loser — and Ford, concluded, it always would be.

""The American consumer is speaking clearly and they want the benefits of electrification like instant torque and mobile power,"" said Andrew Frick, the president of Ford Blue and Ford model e, the company's commercial and electric divisions. He spoke to reporters on a call on Monday. ""But they also demand affordability … rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas.""

The Lightning's design evolved from what was once a gas-powered truck. And now it will come full circle; an upcoming plug-in hybrid version of the truck will once again have a gasoline engine, in the form of a generator that will allow the vehicle to keep driving even if the battery runs out of juice. The all-electric Lightning is dead; the extended-range Lightning is on its way.

The all-electric F-150 Lightning was a big deal to Ford. It was announced in 2021 with great fanfare and an appealingly low price of just $40,000. But once it actually hit production lines, Ford was never able to sell it for anything close to the promised price tag; the 2025 model started at around $55,000.

The truck was designed to appeal to mainstream truck enthusiasts, with no quirky EV styling. It came festooned with outlets everywhere, leveraging the onboard battery so drivers could run tools at a worksite, power appliances at a tailgate party and even run their house on it, using it like a generator during a power outage.

The Lightning won 2023 Truck of the Year from Motortrend, unanimously, and from the North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year Awards. It was Kelley Blue Book's top pick for electric trucks in 2024. And it was the best-selling electric truck in America last quarter, Ford says.

But that category as a whole was struggling, as electric pickups failed to live up to lofty expectations — for performance and affordability, and as a result, for sales. The Lightning, in particular, struggled with reliability. Shoppers were turned off by its limited range when towing; why buy a truck that can't do truck stuff?

And, more to the point, Ford lost money on every vehicle, even at the higher-than-promised price point. EV sales have been lower than automakers had expected in the past few years. Production costs didn't come down as much as Ford had hoped.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pulled a 180 on EV policy, eliminating incentives and requirements that pushed buyers and automakers alike toward electric vehicles.

That includes stripping away a $7,500 tax credit that had made some EVs more affordable, and removing emissions and fuel economy standards that gave Ford — among other EV makers — an incentive to keep unprofitable vehicles in production. Those rules, which required automakers to make their new vehicle fleets cleaner, on average, over time, are being dialed down — which means automakers can make more big gas- and diesel-powered trucks and fewer EVs without running afoul of federal regulations.

Frick said that ""changes in the regulatory environment"" were part of the ""entire landscape"" that pushed Ford to discontinue the vehicle and work on the extended-range version instead.

Meanwhile, Ford's all-electric ambitions will be smaller — literally, with more compact and affordable vehicles at the heart of the company's EV plans, starting with the midsize pickup truck the company announced in August. Ford is targeting a price point of $30,000 and expects to roll them out roughly a year from now.

The change in plans will cost Ford billions of dollars in write-offs and cash this year, but the company says it will make up for it by replacing a money-losing vehicle with ones it hopes will be profitable.

The pivot also leaves Ford with far more battery production capacity than it needs, since the company had invested heavily to build battery factories to supply the EV production lines that it's now idling.

So it announced a new line of business: Ford will be revamping a battery production site in Kentucky to build batteries for stationary storage instead of for trucks. Those batteries can be sold to balance the electric grid — batteries can charge up when electricity is cheap, like when wind and solar are abundant, and discharge it when electricity is scarce, a phenomenon that's already reshaping the electric grids in California and Texas.

They'll also be sold to data centers and other industrial customers, Ford says.
