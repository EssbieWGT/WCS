Over the past couple of years, the use of solar energy has been significantly on the rise as it has become cheaper to install and is more environmentally friendly, with it converting sunlight to electricity. Solar energy is the second biggest reusable energy source as of now, and is expected to become number one in 2026.

Solar For All first started in 2022 under the Biden administration, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act: new environmental laws that would help fight against climate change. In August of 2024, Solar For All had provided monetary grants for 60 recipients including 49 states, six tribes, and the U.S. territories.

The program also helps to cut the costs of the electricity bill, up to 20 percent for over 900,000 homes.

“I think cost is a big factor into why we can or cannot be environmentally friendly. Sometimes you don’t have a choice,” said Amisha Shankar ’26.

Programs like Solar For All are also seen as a good way to remind people to be more aware of their ecological footprint, and to be more environmentally friendly.

“Solar panels are very expensive, and so by having these free forms of energy people are more willing to use it,” added Shankar.

Many in the United States have been affected by the cancellation of the program, such as the southern states. In Texas, Harris County was granted $249 million to help distribute solar and battery power to in-need neighborhoods. This grant provided workforce training for low-income workers and minorities.

The move to cut the program by the EPA was ultimately made by the Trump Administration, as they decided to cut back on federal support for solar and wind energy.

“If we cut programs like this, we’re going to use energy in ways that we’ve always had, which is not sustainable,” said Environmental Science teacher Michael O’Brien.

As renewable energy becomes more common, decisions like these may make it harder for people in the United States to become more eco-friendly, and would ultimately contribute to global warming and climate change as a whole.",https://rcrusadernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0392-e1765946707499.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 05:59:03.979808

Already, they’ve managed to block or stall tens of billions of dollars’ worth of potential investment in proposed data centers.
“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing,” says Miquel Vila, an analyst at the research firm Data Center Watch who’s been tracking campaigns against data centers across the US since 2023.
Virginia, Maryland, and Minnesota, meanwhile, have introduced legislation attempting to rein in tax incentives for data centers or energy costs for other consumers, the Data Center Watch report says.
They argue that there aren’t enough policies in place to prevent data centers from burdening nearby communities with higher bills and more pollution.","If there’s one thing Republicans and Democrats came together on in 2025 — at least at the local level — it was to stop big, energy-hungry data center projects.

For communities sick of rising electricity bills and pollution from power plants, data centers have become an obvious target. Fights against new data centers surged this year as grassroots groups, voters, and local lawmakers demanded more accountability from developers. Already, they’ve managed to block or stall tens of billions of dollars’ worth of potential investment in proposed data centers. And they’re not letting up.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing,” says Miquel Vila, an analyst at the research firm Data Center Watch who’s been tracking campaigns against data centers across the US since 2023.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing.”

The group’s latest report found that developers either canceled or delayed 20 projects after facing pushback from locals, representing $98 billion in proposed investments in the second quarter of this year. In fact, from late March through June, $24.2 billion in projects were blocked and $73.7 billion delayed. That’s an increase compared to 16 blocked or postponed projects from 2023 through the first quarter of this year, the group notes.

The number of proposed data center projects has grown, which is a big reason why opposition is also picking up steam. Inventory in the four biggest data center markets in North America — Northern Virginia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Phoenix — grew by 43 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of this year, according to commercial real estate company CBRE. But plans for massive new facilities have also sparked battles across the nation.

Data centers eat up a lot of electricity, particularly for more powerful chips used for new AI models. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow by 22 percent by the end of the year compared to last year. A high-density rack of servers in an AI data center might use as much as 80 to 100 homes’ worth of power, or upward of 100 kilowatts, according to Dan Thompson, a principal research analyst at S&P Global. AI also requires a lot of water to keep servers cool and generate electricity and could use as much annually as the indoor needs of 18.5 million US households by 2028 by one estimate.

Google dropped its plans for a new data center in Franklin Township, Indiana, in September after residents raised concerns about how much water and electricity the new data center would use. The Indianapolis City-County Council was reportedly expected to deny the project’s rezoning application. That victory for residents in Indiana isn’t captured in the Data Center Watch report, which is only updated with information through June.

Other data center projects that are moving forward or already operating still face resistance. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, faces a potential lawsuit from the NAACP and Southern Environmental Law Center over pollution from its data center in Memphis. Peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels have jumped by 79 percent in the area surrounding the data center since it started operating in 2024, according to research from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville requested by Time magazine.

xAI, which is building a second, larger data center in Memphis, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge, but says “We’re moving toward a future where we will harness our cluster’s full power to solve intractable problems,” on its website.

“No community should be forced to sacrifice clean air, clean water, or safe homes so that corporations and billionaires can build energy-hungry facilities,” the NAACP said in guiding principles that it shared with The Verge in September for other grassroots groups working to hold data center developers accountable for their impact on nearby neighborhoods.

Meta is facing a backlash against its largest data center yet planned for Richland Parish, Louisiana. Local utility Entergy broke ground this month on two of three gas plants it’s building to meet that facility’s electricity demands, expected to reach triple the amount of power New Orleans uses in a year. “Entergy LA customers are now set to subsidize Meta’s data center costs,” the Union of Concerned Scientists says in a November blog post, including an estimated $3.2 billion for the three gas-fired plants and a new $550 million transmission line. Entergy, on the other hand, contends that “Meta’s electric payments to Entergy will lower what customers pay for resilience upgrades by approximately 10%,” according to communications manager Brandon Scardigli.

“Our agreement with Entergy was structured to ensure that other customers are not paying for our data center energy use,” Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle says in an email to The Verge. Settle adds that Meta is contributing $15 million to Entergy’s ratepayer support program and more than $200 million for local infrastructure improvements.

“Now, we have a bogey man.”

Rising electricity costs became a flashpoint during November elections in the US this year, helping to propel two Democrats to the governor’s offices in New Jersey and Virginia. New Jersey residents have faced one of the steepest rises in power prices of any state in the nation, while Virginia is home to “data center alley,” through which 70 percent of internet traffic passes.

“Now, we have a bogey man — data centers who are these large energy users who are coming in, and in many states, getting sweetheart deals on wholesale electricity prices, when regular consumers don’t have that type of sway,” Tony Reames, a professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan and former Department of Energy official under President Biden, said to The Verge after the election.

States, both red and blue, are starting to set some limits on those sweetheart deals. After South Dakota lawmakers rejected a bill that would have offered developers sales tax refunds, Applied Digital paused plans for a $16 billion AI campus in the state. Virginia, Maryland, and Minnesota, meanwhile, have introduced legislation attempting to rein in tax incentives for data centers or energy costs for other consumers, the Data Center Watch report says.

Nationally, more than 230 health and environmental groups have called for a moratorium on data center construction. The organizations, led by the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, sent a letter to Congress with their demands in December. They argue that there aren’t enough policies in place to prevent data centers from burdening nearby communities with higher bills and more pollution. President Donald Trump released an “AI Action Plan” in July that aims to speed data center development in part by rolling back environmental regulations.

With midterm elections next year, we’re likely to see more data center fights playing into local politics, Vila expects. “It’s going to be very interesting to track how this opposition impacts the regulatory framework,” he says.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/258090_EOY_2025_CVirginia_DATA_CENTER.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-20 05:59:16.701054

Rodriguez, Kyle Bradley, James Goodwin, Federico Holm, Liam LaMountain, Sarah Kadous, The Regulatory Review",,,,,https://www.theregreview.org/2025/12/20/seminar-predicting-turbidity-protecting-tap-water/,"Scholars analyze how the use of machine learning could reshape EPA drinking water standards.

New York City operates the largest unfiltered surface water supply in the United States, serving 10 million people under an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD). The determination is a regulatory waiver that allows the city to avoid constructing a filtration plant—saving billions in infrastructure costs—provided it maintains stringent watershed protection standards and demonstrates continuous compliance with federal drinking water regulations.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) may transform how water utilities meet these compliance obligations. Researchers have demonstrated that ML models can forecast tributary turbidity contributions with actionable accuracy, potentially enabling proactive watershed management rather than reactive responses to water quality events. This capability raises fundamental regulatory questions: Should the EPA incorporate predictive ML models into FAD compliance frameworks? What validation standards would apply? And how might algorithmic source attribution shift evidentiary burdens in enforcement proceedings?

The stakes are significant. Portland lost its FAD after detecting naturally occurring pathogens, forcing the city to pursue costly filtration infrastructure. New York City Council oversight hearings in October 2024 emphasized the critical need for New York City Department of Environmental Protection research investment to maintain the city’s FAD status. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo eliminated Chevron deference, raising questions about judicial review of agency technical determinations—including those involving machine learning models.

The regulatory landscape is also evolving rapidly. OMB issued the first government-wide AI policy in March 2024 requiring minimum practices for safety-impacting AI by December 2024. And in January 2024, researchers published a machine learning model that can predict whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—the federal agency responsible for issuing permits for activities affecting navigable waters—would classify a particular water body as falling under federal jurisdiction. The researchers’ model demonstrates that machine learning can predict Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdictional determinations—a precedent for integrating ML into water regulation more broadly.

These developments also carry environmental justice implications. Heavily monitored watersheds, such as the Upper Esopus, benefit from extensive sensor networks and research investment, while under-resourced communities lack comparable infrastructure for predicting and preventing water quality threats.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar, scholars examine the regulatory challenges and opportunities posed by integrating machine learning into drinking water regulation.

In an article published in the JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association, John T. Kemper of the University of Vermont and colleagues demonstrate that machine learning models can forecast turbidity in NYC’s drinking water watershed with actionable accuracy. Kemper and his coauthors combine high-frequency sensor data with U.S. National Water Model output to predict tributary turbidity contributions, enabling water managers to anticipate rather than react to water quality events. They find that their models can provide useful 24-hour forecasts, suggesting ML-based monitoring could enhance real-time watershed management and potentially transform how utilities demonstrate FAD compliance.

In a study published in Science, Simon Greenhill of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues introduce a machine learning model that predicts Clean Water Act jurisdictional determinations with high accuracy. The Greenhill team trains their model on more than 150,000 historical Army Corps of Engineers decisions to classify whether particular waters fall under federal protection. They argue that WOTUS-ML demonstrates the viability of using machine learning to support regulatory implementation in water law contexts. The Greenhill team estimates that under different regulatory interpretations, between one-fourth and two-thirds of U.S. wetlands and streams fall under CWA protection, providing a framework that could serve as precedent for integrating ML into other areas of environmental regulation.

In an article in the Administrative Law Review, Cary Coglianese of The University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, and Daniel E. Walters of Texas A&M Law, examine the implications of Loper Bright for administrative governance. Coglianese and Walters argue that the elimination of Chevron deference creates significant uncertainty for agency technical determinations, including those that may involve machine learning models. They suggest that the decision might best be considered “something of a Rorschach test inside a crystal ball,” where different observers may see different implications. Coglianese and Walters contend that courts reviewing ML-based regulatory decisions will need new frameworks for evaluating agency expertise and interpretive authority, with particular implications for science-intensive determinations such as those underlying EPA drinking water standards.

In an article in the Minnesota Law Review, Joshua D. Blank of UC Irvine School of Law, and Leigh Osofsky of UNC School of Law, examine federal agencies’ use of automated tools to communicate legal guidance to the public. Blank and Osofsky argue that although chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI systems offer administrative efficiency, they may mislead the public about how law applies to their circumstances. Based on an Administrative Conference of the United States-commissioned study, Blank and Osofsky propose policy recommendations emphasizing transparency, appropriate reliance, and equity. They contend that these considerations are directly relevant to how EPA might deploy ML-based compliance tools while maintaining public trust in drinking water regulation.

In an article in Competition Policy International: TechReg Chronicle, Cary Coglianese of The University of Pennsylvania Law School addresses the challenges of regulating machine learning systems that serve diverse applications across contexts. Coglianese argues that ML’s heterogeneity—the fact that the same underlying techniques may produce vastly different tools with different risk profiles—complicates traditional regulatory approaches that assume more uniform technologies. He contends that regulators must develop flexible frameworks capable of addressing context-specific concerns rather than applying one-size-fits-all rules. Coglianese suggests that agencies like EPA should build capacity in data sciences, deploy management-based regulatory strategies, and remain vigilant when considering how to validate ML models for varied environmental applications such as watershed monitoring.

In an article in Science of the Total Environment, Seigi Karasaki and Rachel Morello-Frosch of the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, and Duncan Callaway of the UC Berkeley Energy and Resources Group, examine how machine learning modeling decisions for drinking water quality prediction can produce differential outcomes across demographic groups. The Karasaki team proposes practices for reducing algorithmic bias in water quality applications. They find that model design choices—including which variables to include and how to weight training data—can affect which communities receive accurate predictions. The Karasaki team suggests that modeling choice transparency and bias-vetting practices may be important when applying machine learning to questions of environmental science and justice.

Thank you. Yes, this is my hometown, and I want to give a warm welcome on a cold day to our friends from Ontario who aren't bothered by cold weather, fortunately. And so, I'm delighted to be able to showcase this extraordinary venue — which we'll talk about momentarily — but for Premier Ford to come here, I'm very grateful that you and your team have made the journey here to do something that I think is landmark. It's extraordinary and very exciting as someone who's from this community and knows that we're going to find a way to continue to work together in partnership the way we always have and always will do.

I want to acknowledge Nicolle Butcher, the President and CEO of Ontario Power Generation. Thank you for lending your expertise to the cause. Minister Lecce, the Legislative Assembly from Ontario. Justin Driscoll, our CEO and President of New York Power Authority. Justin and John Koelmel, the Chairman of the New York Power Authority. All my partners in government. I see our incoming mayor is here, I think. Anybody else? And Crystal here? Crystal Peoples-Stokes — Sean Ryan and Crystal Peoples-Stokes, our many Assemblymembers and elected officials who have joined us here today.

It is great to be here to discuss our energy future, and it's especially fitting. We're here at the Buffalo AKG Museum of Art. And why I wanted to come here? Of any place in the state I could do this is what I'm reminded of — not this building, but the building that you'll see — the older looking building is from the 1901 era. And it was built in order to help showcase the fact that Buffalo was basically the epicenter of everything at the time when it came to power, because we were the first city in the world to be electrified. And so, we had electric lights. People were fascinated by this. What do you mean electric lights? How can that be? And people came from all over to see this in the entire exhibition.

So it was certainly a high point, but a reminder that we can continue energy innovation and how to do power innovation as we venture into this next century. Buffalo is known as the City of Light. And actually I'll say the museum was built for the exhibition, it wasn't done in time. So it missed the opening, but we still celebrate it associated with that as well. But this new building is a reminder of the future and a reminder that traditions matter. And there's been a long standing, proud tradition of cooperation between New York and Ontario. This has always been — this is our neighbor.

[...]

Yeah. We've done so much together, and I'll just digress and say I'm a boater on Lake Erie. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world, and we stop at many of the ports in Colborne, Canada, Ontario, and just feel that warm embrace of a shared bond that our region brings to all of us. It's not just sports — go Blue Jays next time. You did very well this year, but also, I know you're rooting for the Buffalo Bills, and you come to hockey games and the baseball games in the summertime as well. But also our cultures, our tourism. You find me in my old life many times up at Niagara-on-the-Lake or strolling around both sides of the falls.

And so it is just — it's a world class region, and we need to continue working together to promote these incredible assets, but also the strength of our friendship and relationship, which is enduring. And I'm also reminded, we just came off of the bicentennial, the celebration of the Erie Canal — something that was an extraordinary feat of engineering and its time, but also it opened up Canada to New York City. And that connection also was one of the catalysts for explosive growth opening in the Midwest Canadian cities, ultimately the St. Lawrence Seaway that came through. So we've always been connected through waterways and energy sources as well.

And our economies are intertwined. The trade, despite some setbacks — won't go into too much detail there, but we want to make sure that our trade relationship remains trustworthy. It's a beneficial relationship, we understand that. And I'll acknowledge that there've been some terrible policies that have come out of Washington coincidentally just in the one year, and they've been hard to accept as someone who doesn't understand why there's a hostility toward Canada overall. But certainly it shakes us to our core as well as people who value our friends in Ontario and Quebec, particularly as they border our great state.

So I don't want those policies to jeopardize the goodwill, the friendship. And we just want to make sure that we continue doing things that show that collaboration. And as these threats out of Washington come, we're going to stand firm and let people know who our friends are who we also care about very deeply. So our partnership between New York and Ontario is rock solid, and as long as I'm Governor, it's going to stay that way.

And so we sat down together. It's about relationships. Premier Ford and I sat down together. It was a meeting of Northeast governors and the Canadian premiers that all bordered this region. We got together in Boston to talk about the threats out of Washington, how destabilizing that is for trade and our relationships overall, but how we can individually step up and ignore that process — those threats, that hostility — and show we truly are friends. And so we talked about economic opportunities. We also had a great conversation about power, and the Premier spoke with great pride about what is occurring in the Darlington area. We are focusing on small modular reactors, and I was very impressed, and so I wanted to learn more.

And I was intrigued with your forward thinking approach to delivering clean energy for the next generation. And so we focused on how we can stay true to our environmental commitments, which I truly believe in, but also our commitment to rate payers to keep utility costs affordable — which is not just a buzzword, it is the reality. We, as leaders, have to focus on reliability, sustainability and affordability all at the same time. So we found a way together, and that is through nuclear energy. And Ontario is already home to — is it 17 of 18 nuclear plants operating in Canada? So, ahead of your time. And Ontario Power Generation is leading the way in deploying North America's first small modular reactors, which I've been very intrigued with — very intrigued with. And the Darlington project, which you'll talk about, is going to be generating 1.2 gigawatts of power. And our conversation also led me to the understanding that OPG is collaborating with the Tennessee Valley Authority as well.

When you said that, I said, “Wait a minute? Why are you cooperating with them? I'm right here.” So that was another thought — that light bulb that went off in my head. Like, why aren't we also taking advantage of your forward-thinking approach when it comes to power?

So today — to cement these conversations just from a few months ago to add some substance to them — OPG signed a memorandum of understanding with NYPA to work together to share information on the best ways to bring advanced nuclear power to the State of New York. And they'll use their expertise, and knowhow and be a great resource in our next chapter in our nuclear story. And the timing is perfect because last summer I charged NYPA — our Executive Director, and our Chairman and others — to find a way to bring advanced nuclear power to Upstate New York. And this will be the first plant in New York State in over a generation.

And I wanted to do this because it's about reliability, affordability, but it's also about the thousands of jobs that are created in the process. And I was excited about that prospect as well. And one gigawatt of nuclear power can power roughly one million homes without adding any carbon to the atmosphere. That's really significant. And it's around the clock. It's every day of the year. It's completely insulated from the threats of rising oil and gas prices.

I believe it can power the industries of tomorrow as we're leaning into, especially here in Upstate New York, Micron — $100 billion investment to make semiconductor chips. The largest private sector investment in American history is going on just down the road in Syracuse. Right up the road in Buffalo, the University of Buffalo, we have $500 million being invested in Empire AI — artificial intelligence for public good. So we need the power source. We want to do all this. Our ambitions are broad, they're exciting, but if we don't power it, it doesn't work. And that's the challenge that we've embraced and we're moving with great speed.

I'm very impatient and I want this to happen. I know there's traditionally been hurdles. Our state has right now three nuclear plants operating. They're all up on Lake Ontario. And one is actually the oldest operating nuclear facility in the United States — going strong and safe since 1969. But it's time for us to bring new nuclear technology into the 21st century. I've spoken, actually, to President Trump about this in the White House and talked about the fact that people aren't embracing nuclear because there's a perception it is a long, arduous process, even a decade to get approvals. And we gleaned that over seven of the 10 years it takes to get nuclear approvals are at the federal level. So he has agreed to find ways to approach that with more urgency.

We are working closely with the federal administration in this particular area, and I want to make sure that everyone knows that we'll bring down the barriers and the costs. That's important. But also, this is not your grandmother's and your grandfather's nuclear. This is advanced. This is state of the art. This is safe. This is safe. And it has automatic safety systems, enhanced containment and rigorous, very rigorous, environmental safeguards.

So since the last six months when I directed NYPA to build a gigawatt of new nuclear capacity, we've moved aggressively to realize that vision. The deadline for request for information passed just last week, and I'm happy to announce that there are 23 developers who've expressed an interest in developing nuclear projects with NYPA. That's extraordinary. That's beyond what I could have imagined. That's a new era for nuclear power in the State of New York. And eight communities have expressed interest in hosting a plant, Also a very positive development. So what we want to do is make sure we also have the workforce to be able to do all this exciting work. And I've announced $40 million over the next four years in new funding for NYPA to launch a specialized nuclear workforce training program with our unions and our universities. So that's how we'll meet the demand by focusing now on the training required so we have the workforce in place.

And we've made some strategic hires at NYPA. Christopher Hanson, the former Chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was hired as a senior consultant to help us navigate that federal licensing. And I'm sorry I took Todd Josifovski, hired as our Senior Vice President of Nuclear Development, formerly the Project Director at Darlington — which you're already underway, so we need some help. Okay? You're good with that?

So he'll make sure that — just as is happening at Darlington, which he’ll talk about, is that the constructional process, very quickly. So the first phase that is being licensed this year will be on track and operational. Our goal is to be within five years, not 10, but five years.

And so, we've been excited about this and bringing a closer relationship. And in a couple minutes, Premier Ford and I will sign a Declaration of Intent to reaffirm and strengthen our historic bonds. We'll show the world that we have no tolerance for policies that are intended to drive us apart. We look forward to working together through this particular opportunity and many, many more as we focus on the sharing of opportunities, and resources, and intellect and expertise that'll help bolster both of our economies, and keep us strong and to keep the lights on.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-12/nuclearenergyhero2.jpg?h=489870a4&itok=XT17D1TD,N,,2025-12-20 06:57:24.638357

Two-hundred and twenty-one of the 417 voting members approved the bill, called the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED, Act on Thursday.
The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.
He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.
“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained.","The House of Representatives has passed a bill aimed at easing the federal environmental review process.

Two-hundred and twenty-one of the 417 voting members approved the bill, called the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED, Act on Thursday. The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.

Eleven Democrats joined 210 Republicans to support the bill, introduced by Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, while one GOP moderate voted against it. Westerman said after the act passed that it would reduce unnecessary permitting delays and make it easier for local governments to complete “economy-stimulating” projects.

“You may not realize it but permitting touches all aspects of life, from the ability to complete roadways and bridges that can prevent traffic jams all the way to the ability to lower the cost of your monthly electricity bill,” the congressman said in a statement.

“This isn’t just legislation for large, federal industries, it’s a bill for you and every other taxpaying Arkansan.”

Some Democrats who voted against the act include party leadership and members of the progressive caucus. The bill favors the Trump administration’s energy agenda, according to the caucus, which opposes fossil fuel industries.

“Environmental protection groups warn that this is a dangerous attempt to gut NEPA, the nation’s bedrock environmental law, turning it into a toothless procedural formality,” the group said in a statement. “The effect of this bill will be to prioritize oil and gas, and SPEED Act does nothing to advance permitting reforms for clean energy that progressives have long championed.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, contrastingly described the bill as part of a “pro-growth” agenda. He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained. “House Republicans continue to pass commonsense legislation that codifies President Trump’s executive orders and advances a pro-growth agenda to lower energy costs, strengthen national security, unleash American energy production, and get American workers and industry building again.”

The Trump administration has prioritized fossil fuel energy sources over renewable ones, and Democrats have expressed concern about the environmental impacts of its approach.",https://wlos.com/resources/media2/16x9/4000/1320/0x104/90/d6cff8f7-1bc3-481d-97ad-c2d7a90c458d-GettyImages22425071171.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 03:57:51.974354

Minnesota Power had been a 50% owner and planned to build and operate the plant.

Last year, the co-owners withdrew their air permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for the 625 MW fossil gas project. The withdrawal happened after the City of Superior voted to deny local zoning permits necessary for the project to move forward. Local residents, Dairyland and Minnesota Power customers, Fond du Lac and Red Cliff Tribes, and environmental groups, including Sierra Club, Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA), Healthy Climate Wisconsin, and Clean Wisconsin, have been calling for a full project cancellation for years.

“This is the right step forward to protect air quality in Superior and the surrounding communities. NTEC was outdated almost as soon as it was proposed, and years of delays have underscored what a poor idea this is. There’s no need for another new dirty, expensive gas plant in Wisconsin. All eyes are on Dairyland to cancel plans for NTEC once and for all as we transition to clean energy,” said Elizabeth Ward, Sierra Club Wisconsin Chapter Director.

The final regulations omit the rule altogether.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.
Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.","On the day before Thanksgiving, the Treasury and IRS issued final regulations for the Section 4501 excise tax on stock repurchases. Enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Section 4501 imposes a 1% excise tax on repurchases of stock by public U.S. companies, as well as purchases of the stock of foreign publicly traded corporations by their U.S. affiliates.

As previously discussed in Brass Tax, proposed regulations for Section 4501 issued in 2024 intentionally omitted exceptions for several types of transactions that many commentators believed should not be subject to the excise tax. In the final regulations, the Treasury and IRS have backtracked on those omissions, and have included a number of exceptions for transactions that are in form redemptions of stock (or so treated for federal income tax purposes), but are generally not seen as the sort of repurchases that Congress intended the excise tax to target, including:

repurchases of ""plain vanilla"" or ""debt-like"" preferred stock

payment of consideration funded by the target corporation in take-private transactions (which is generally treated as a redemption for U.S. federal income tax purposes)

redemptions of additional forms of ""tier 1 capital,"" such as that issued by cooperative banks and agricultural credit associations

acquisitions and cancellations of stock in certain liquidations and acquisitive reorganizations

exchanges of stock in single-party reorganizations (that is, recapitalizations that qualify as ""E"" reorganizations and changes in identity, form or place of organization that qualify as ""F"" reorganizations)

certain repurchases by investment companies that do not qualify as RICs for federal income tax purposes (repurchases by companies that qualify as RICs or REITs were already exempt)

In addition, the final regulations do not include the controversial ""funding rule"" that appeared in prior IRS guidance, under which a foreign corporation's repurchase of its own stock would have been subject to the excise tax to the extent the repurchase was funded by a U.S. affiliate. The funding rule contained in the 2024 proposed regulations, under which repurchases funded by a U.S. affiliate would have been taxable only if done ""with a principal purpose of avoiding"" the excise tax, already represented a retreat from an earlier, more mechanical version in Notice 2023-2. That more limited funding rule nevertheless attracted significant criticism, including that compliance with the rule would be administratively burdensome and its ""principal purpose"" test could be vague and indeterminate in many cases. The final regulations omit the rule altogether.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Entergy Arkansas yesterday announced Next Generation Arkansas, the company's comprehensive plan to provide electricity that does more for Arkansas by strengthening reliability, expanding energy supply, driving economic growth and keeping power affordable for all customers. The company, and its more than 2,800 employees, are focusing the plan and their efforts in the coming years on helping keep the state and its customers out in front of the emerging electric future developing in the U.S. and globally.

""Next Generation Arkansas is about preparing our state for what's ahead. By strengthening the grid, adding new generation and modernizing how we deliver power, we're making the system more reliable and more affordable while also building a system that enables unprecedented growth over the long term,"" said Laura Landreaux, Entergy Arkansas president and CEO. ""These investments help prevent outages, support new jobs and ensure that Arkansas families and businesses continue to benefit from low, predictable electricity costs as our state grows.""

Next Generation Arkansas is a multi-faceted plan that includes input from state and local leaders and Entergy Arkansas customers across the state to ensure transparency, accountability and open dialogue about affordability and how to best meet their needs. The plan represents the company's response to several power-related issues facing the state:

Recent state growth requiring more power to serve customers;

More extreme weather in recent years affecting customer reliability;

Increasing state competitiveness for job-creating projects; and

Cost pressures requiring new approaches to keep rates low for customers.

To meet this demand, Next Generation Arkansas has been built around four core priorities, detailed below.

1. Better power for Arkansas: Fewer outages, faster repairs

Entergy Arkansas is launching one of the most ambitious reliability improvement plans in recent history designed to make the power grid stronger and more reliable with an initial goal to reduce power outages by at least 30% over the coming years.

In addition to increasing vegetation investments that will keep power lines clear, the company is performing reliability improvement projects across the state and deploying new, advanced technology tools that will help spot problems faster, prevent challenges and improve power quality for decades to come.

The economic growth the company is helping enable is adding new large customers to the grid that helps offset the costs of these improvements for existing customers.

2. More power for Arkansas: Power when and where needed to meet soaring demand

Arkansas was recently ranked the fastest-growing state economy in America for two quarters in a row, the No. 1 state for inbound movers, and the state with the lowest cost of living. Arkansas is already expected to see more than a 35% increase in power needs in the next five years, and with projections showing that figure could more than double, Entergy Arkansas is acting now to build the next generation of power sources to support the state's growth and serve its customers while keeping rates affordable.

To do this, Entergy Arkansas plans to invest in approximately 2,600 MW of new, more fuel-efficient generation resources and repower approximately 1,600 MW of existing generation in the next five years pending approval from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, including:

Investing in new, modern natural gas plants to increase fuel efficiency by up to 40%, which lowers fuel charges on customer bills:

450 MW at the new Ironwood Power Station natural gas plant in Hot Spring County (2028).

750 MW at the new Jefferson Power Station natural gas plant in Jefferson County (2029).

600 MW of solar + 350 MW of battery storage at the Arkansas Cypress facility in Jefferson County (2028), which will provide clean, renewable power that lowers fuel charges on customer bills.

Retrofitting coal-fired generators to burn natural gas and extend their lives.

Investing in upgrades at existing natural gas facilities to increase output more than 150 MW.

Renewing the license to generate 1,800 MW of clean, reliable 24/7 energy produced by the Arkansas Nuclear One power plant and investing in new, more efficient plant equipment that increases the output of the facility.

These investments will ensure Arkansas has a balanced, more cost-efficient, ""all-of-the-above"" energy mix needed to support homes, businesses and new industries.

3. Job power for Arkansas: Helping the state recruit more and better jobs

Arkansas offers a strong pro-business environment, and over the past five years, Entergy Arkansas has partnered with state and community leaders to drive the creation of more than 7,500 jobs and over $13 billion in capital investments. As electricity becomes a key factor in securing new business, the state must continue delivering the power infrastructure and site development needed to compete. When structured strategically, these private investments not only generate tax revenue and quality jobs, but also provide broader benefits for Arkansans, including bill savings and a more reliable grid. The company plans to do this by:

Using the blueprint created by the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025 to work at the speed needed to compete nationally for once-in-a-generation tech and industrial projects.

Bolstering local job impact – Arkansas building Arkansas – by using local contractors and companies around the state whenever possible, reinvesting growth back into our communities through new jobs, state and local tax revenue, and indirect economic impact.

Creating economic impact while implementing the plan – for example, the development of the Ironwood, Jefferson Power Station and Arkansas Cypress power plants would create approximately 1,860 direct jobs as well as significantly more indirect jobs during construction, provide 46 permanent jobs during operation, and that will generate more than $105 million in new local and state tax revenue by 2030.

""We want to commend state leaders for passing the Generating Jobs Act of 2025, which is a landmark legislation and shows what's possible when Arkansas sets a bold vision for its future, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission for approving the new associated rider,"" Landreaux said. ""Because of the state's leadership, Arkansas has the tools to compete for once-in-a-generation opportunities. We are committed to delivering a power system that attracts new jobs, strengthens communities, and keeps our state moving forward for the next generation of Arkansans.""

4. Affordable power for Arkansas: Keeping rates low and predictable

Entergy Arkansas's rates remain 22% below the national average, and the company plans to continue finding ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and offer innovative bill solutions to keep power affordable for all customers, even as the company invests in the state's growth including:

Leveraging new policies to help build the power system Arkansas needs while keeping rate stable and predictable.

Using new technologies to help manage the grid and prevent outages at less cost to customers.

Providing customers with ways to lower their bills with new rate structures and by helping them access resources like free home energy checkups, free and discounted energy-saving products, and rebates on energy-efficient equipment purchases.

Continuing to recruit new large industrial customers to help spread the cost of maintaining and upgrading the power grid across a larger customer base and reduce the burden on residents and small businesses.

Working with new large customer partners to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives and encourage others to provide community support, as Google has with its $25 million Energy Impact Fund.

All of these efforts will be managed with transparency for customers and with direct oversight from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Landreaux said.

""Our 2,800 Entergy employees in Arkansas and I understand that this is some of the most important work of our careers, and we feel it personally because we're Arkansans too,"" Landreaux said. ""We're proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.""

As we close out this challenging year, here’s how Planet Detroit held the line for Michigan’s environment and communities through the four pillars of our reporting: accountability, service, solutions, and community voices.

Here’s a rundown of the stories we reported on this year.

ACCOUNTABILITY: Exposing threats and holding power accountable

Data centers invade the state

We published this comprehensive look at small-town backlash against data center sprawl in September, ahead of the curve as other outlets scrambled to catch up months later. The story captured rural communities speaking out against Big Tech’s energy-hungry infrastructure. The David-versus-Goliath battles in Washtenaw County foreshadowed a statewide pattern.

Our June piece on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s appointment to the Michigan Public Service Commission warned readers about utility influence on the commission. This concern materialized in December as the MPSC considered fast-tracking DTE’s Saline data center.

Then, this fall, as the data center phenomenon grew, we created a comprehensive guide to data centers in Michigan explaining what they are, how they impact communities, and how residents can engage in the approval process. We also produced a guide to the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates utilities and approves major energy projects, so residents understand how to participate in hearings and make their voices heard.

Water infrastructure continues failing Detroit

When a major water main break flooded homes in Southwest Detroit in February, we documented the immediate crisis. But we didn’t stop there.

Our follow-up investigation revealed how climate change is compounding Detroit’s water infrastructure problems. “Weather whiplash” events cause pipes to undergo “thermal shock,” making them brittle and prone to catastrophic failure. The 1930s-era water main that burst, combined with increasingly volatile temperatures, creates a perfect storm for more frequent breaks.

This exemplifies our approach: breaking news coverage that captures immediate human impact, followed by investigative reporting that explains systemic forces at play.

Wyandotte’s water crisis: An investigation

Our deep dive into Wyandotte’s drinking water started with a single state report and evolved into months of accountability journalism that revealed immediate health risks and a decade-long deception.

In May, we reported state regulators found “significant deficiencies” in Wyandotte’s water system. The report revealed something else: Wyandotte had stopped fluoridating its drinking water — yet the city’s website still claimed it was doing so.

Our June reporting found that Wyandotte had quietly discontinued fluoridation in 2015 without alerting residents beyond its annual mandated water quality report, and only removed the misleading claim after our story. The city promised a fluoride plan by October, a full decade later.

We covered packed hearings where residents, dentists, and health experts urged officials to restore fluoridation. But when the vote came in October, commissioners voted 2-2, failing to restore it. “I have my reasons why; I don’t need to make a comment,” one commissioner told us.

This investigation exemplifies sustained accountability journalism: document-based reporting that exposes government failures, persistent follow-up through multiple hearings, and giving voice to residents who deserve transparency.

Holding polluters accountable: 3 fights for environmental justice

EES Coke: Our reporting from an EPA pollution trial — picked up by the Associated Press — tracked this Southwest Detroit polluter through courts and regulatory processes. When the EPA offered pollution exemptions and EES Coke applied, we were the only local newsroom reporting on what it means for residents breathing that air.

Aevitas: After a decade of odor complaints, a June fire finally sparked city action. We documented how the blaze, which took seven hours to control and injured a firefighter, revealed the facility’s impacts on Jefferson Chalmers and Marina District residents. Our analysis showed area odor complaints dropped 90% after Aevitas shut down. City Council passed an enforcement resolution, and a state regulator declared the facility’s air permit “obsolete.”

US Ecology: Our December reporting may mark a significant shift in how hazardous waste facilities are regulated in Detroit. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy ultimately renewed the facility’s permit despite years of community concerns, but added additional oversight aimed at odor control. We’re watching to see if this represents a real turning point in the state’s approach to industrial permitting.

Together, these stories demonstrate our relentless attention to industrial pollution. This sustained coverage holds polluters, regulators, and local officials accountable.

SERVICE: Making civic action easy

We believe journalism shouldn’t just inform people about problems. It should make civic action easy. That’s why we pair accountability reporting with practical tools, guides, and explainers that help residents take the next step. Whether you’re checking if your home has a lead pipe, understanding your energy bill, or learning how to file a complaint about air quality, we’re building the civic infrastructure Detroit and Michigan need.

Civic action boxes: From story to action

Every major accountability story includes a civic action box — a simple tool that answers “What can I do about this?” Whether it’s checking if your home has lead pipes, filing an air quality complaint, understanding your energy bill, or connecting with a community health worker, these boxes eliminate the friction between learning about a problem and taking concrete steps to address it. We don’t just want you informed: we want you equipped.

Data dashboards: Transparency you can use

Government agencies collect vast amounts of environmental and public health data, but accessing it often requires navigating clunky databases, filing public records requests, or decoding technical jargon. Planet Detroit does that work so you don’t have to. Our dashboards translate complex datasets into tools you can actually use to track progress, compare communities, and hold decision-makers accountable.

Michigan Lead Service Line Tracker – See which Michigan water systems have lead pipes and track replacement progress in your community. Built in partnership with Safe Water Engineering, this tool makes it easy to check if your home may have lead pipes and monitor local progress toward removal.

Michigan Air Permit Violations 2018-2024 – Track which facilities are violating their air pollution permits. This dashboard makes enforcement data accessible so communities can hold polluters and regulators accountable.

Guides and explainers paired with accountability stories

Every major investigation came with tools to help readers respond:

Data centers → Community guide to data centers and MPSC explainer

Water infrastructure failures → Lead pipe replacement checker

Air quality crises → Air quality guide and complaint filing instructions

Medical transport crisis → Resources for accessing health care

Community health → How to connect with local support

Electronics recycling → Where and how to properly dispose

Browse all service journalism

These aren’t add-ons to our reporting—they’re core to our mission. Information without action is just noise. We believe residents deserve both the truth about what’s happening and the tools to do something about it.

SOLUTIONS: Community-driven responses to challenges

We don’t just report problems, we spotlight the people and organizations building solutions. In 2025, our solutions journalism showed how communities are responding to environmental and health challenges with innovation, collaboration, and determination.

From food security to healthcare to habitat restoration

When federal SNAP delays left thousands of Michiganders hungry, we identified grassroots Detroit organizations that stepped up. It’s an example of how service journalism and community voices converge to reveal both problems and solutions.

Health care innovation came from unexpected sources. A volunteer-run clinic expanded its services to fill gaps in Detroit’s medical safety net. “It’s just a beautiful thing,” one provider told us.

Environmental restoration efforts took root along the Detroit River, where a local nonprofit began restoring wetland habitat on islands, actively reversing decades of degradation rather than simply documenting decline.

COMMUNITY VOICES: Residents telling their own stories

In 2025, our Neighborhood Reporting Lab continued to build on our belief that the best environmental journalism centers on the voices of people living closest to the issues. We trained Detroit residents to report on the health, climate, and community issues they see in their own neighborhoods, producing more than 30 stories that revealed the texture of environmental life in Detroit that no outsider could capture.

Community residents emerged as powerful storytellers, uplifting example after example of local leadership. Loretta Powell grows vegetables and neighbors together on Detroit’s east side, while Danny Dolley leads watershed restoration efforts in Chandler Park. Jason Ford’s work at Detroit People’s Food Co-op embodies his philosophy: “We gotta build the systems.” Erik Shelley’s journey in the fight for social justice shows him to be “someone you want on your side.”

Urban agriculture stories revealed the practical challenges and creative solutions. One Detroit farmer tackles water access to ensure “the plants will be watered fully and consistently.” Brittney Rooney grows food on Beaverland Farms and in the Brightmoor community. Dazmonique Carr works to improve Detroit’s food access, one produce box at a time.

Innovation took surprising forms. One Detroit woman turned a birthday tradition into a global upcycling movement — The Chip Bag Project even won a state grant. Detroit’s ReVamp clothing swaps make the world more sustainable, one party at a time. Detroit’s Architectural Salvage Warehouse proves that upcycled gems are everywhere.

Culture and sustainability intersect in unexpected places. Dominick Lemonious reimagines the art gallery at Detroit’s “Black Store.” Chi Fan Le brings authentic Chinese cuisine to Detroit’s pop-up scene. Sustain-A-City showed how Detroit reimagines sustainability through art.

Health and wellness stories captured movement and connection. We Walk Detroit builds health and community step by step in city parks — “therapeutic,” participants say. Black students sail the Detroit River with Harry Jones — “water is in my DNA,” he says. Socially Chrissy, Detroit’s bold biking mom, proves no car means no problem.

The Chandler Park Fieldhouse opened as an east side hub for health, hope, and community. Meanwhile, Detroiters described the citywide struggle with truck traffic: “Our streets are sinking.”

These stories don’t just inform, they honor the lived expertise of Detroit residents, celebrate community-led solutions, and build connections between neighbors working on similar challenges. The Neighborhood Reporting Lab proves that environmental journalism is most powerful when communities tell their own stories.

But, there are plenty of things you can do or change to lower your impact on the environment and save some money.

Heather Bolick is the Chief Sustainability and Resiliency Officer for the city of Charlotte. She says some of these changes can also support local businesses.

""Please, real trees instead of artificial. You'll support your local North Carolina economy farmers, and it's much better for the environment,"" Bolick says.

She also explains you can eventually put them back into the environment with composting.

When it comes to matching pajamas, consider reusing them, instead of buying new or making a DIY project.

""How about if you took apart those pajamas and put them back together like sort of a patchwork thing?"" Bolick suggests. ""Because there's some local businesses here in Charlotte, Spring Clean being one of them, that actually does that they take unused materials and like put them back together for for higher and better use.""

Try to reuse gift bags and bows or choose recyclable paper options.

A fun activity for the kids and a way to keep them distracted when they’re out of school: wrap in brown paper and let them color and decorate themselves.

Two-hundred and twenty-one of the 417 voting members approved the bill, called the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED, Act on Thursday.
The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.
He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.
“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained.","The House of Representatives has passed a bill aimed at easing the federal environmental review process.

The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.

Eleven Democrats joined 210 Republicans to support the bill, introduced by Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, while one GOP moderate voted against it. Westerman said after the act passed that it would reduce unnecessary permitting delays and make it easier for local governments to complete “economy-stimulating” projects.

“You may not realize it but permitting touches all aspects of life, from the ability to complete roadways and bridges that can prevent traffic jams all the way to the ability to lower the cost of your monthly electricity bill,” the congressman said in a statement.

“This isn’t just legislation for large, federal industries, it’s a bill for you and every other taxpaying Arkansan.”

Some Democrats who voted against the act include party leadership and members of the progressive caucus. The bill favors the Trump administration’s energy agenda, according to the caucus, which opposes fossil fuel industries.

“Environmental protection groups warn that this is a dangerous attempt to gut NEPA, the nation’s bedrock environmental law, turning it into a toothless procedural formality,” the group said in a statement. “The effect of this bill will be to prioritize oil and gas, and SPEED Act does nothing to advance permitting reforms for clean energy that progressives have long championed.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, contrastingly described the bill as part of a “pro-growth” agenda. He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained. “House Republicans continue to pass commonsense legislation that codifies President Trump’s executive orders and advances a pro-growth agenda to lower energy costs, strengthen national security, unleash American energy production, and get American workers and industry building again.”

Despite federal rollbacks, LCV’s state affiliates won critical state and local policies across the country to promote clean energy, lower energy costs, reduce pollution, and protect our communities and environment.

In 2025, states from Arizona to Wisconsin advanced clean energy progress, leading the nation forward on climate action and fighting to lower energy bills for families. Through the Clean Energy for All campaign, LCV and our 30 state affiliates played a central role in driving this progress — mobilizing grassroots demand, building strong coalitions, winning equitable policies, and ensuring that benefits reach communities.

Watch some of our state affiliate leaders describe exciting affordable clean energy policy wins in their states:

2. State Democracy Wins

To combat the climate crisis and protect our democracy, we need a government that hears, protects, and reflects the people it represents.

LCV and our 30 state affiliates worked all year to protect and expand access to the voting booth by organizing and advocating for strong pro-democracy policies across the country. With your support, we scored some major victories. We also pushed back against authoritarianism by helping to mobilize millions of people during several nationwide days of nonviolent protests — a show of strength for our growing movement.

3. Accountability: We Can’t Afford This

LCV is known for holding lawmakers publicly accountable for their votes. So when congressional Republicans voted to gut affordable clean energy and raise prices, we launched a nationwide campaign to let their constituents know and to push Republicans to change course.

As energy costs soared across the country, LCV showed up in the home districts of members of Congress who voted for Trump’s Big Ugly Bill to deliver a powerful message from their constituents: We can’t afford this. Our work is helping to shape a national narrative on high energy costs and the economic benefits of affordable clean energy — work we’ll continue in 2026.

Read about how we’re holding congressional Republicans accountable for rising energy prices.

4. Public Lands: Stop the Sell-Off

Our public lands and waters are national treasures that belong to us all. The Trump administration is relentlessly trying to sell them off to polluters, and we’re mobilizing nationwide to stop them.

There are 640 million acres of public lands owned and managed by the federal government, including national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas. These lands enjoy some of the broadest public support of any major issue, and the vast majority of Americans oppose closing or selling them.

In April, LCV and our state affiliates launched a nationwide campaign to protect our irreplaceable public lands and waters from the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks. In August, we held events in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Oregon, and other states with advocates, lawmakers, community leaders, and artists to celebrate and defend the lands we rely on. We continue to put pressure on lawmakers to stop their sell-off for drilling, mining, and logging.

5. Winning Elections

Over the last year, our movement took this message to heart: don’t agonize — organize. In 2025, we applied lessons learned from the 2024 elections and zeroed in on voters’ concerns around affordability, especially utility rates. From ad testing to door-to-door canvassing, we innovated our tactics to reach voters and turn them out for pro-clean energy candidates.

Our strategy succeeded, as our state affiliates ran successful campaigns in important state and local elections nationwide. Their efforts to define the issues and engage voters helped deliver major victories in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and elsewhere, along with other important wins for our environment and democracy, from state Supreme Court races to ballot measures to city council races.

Part III — Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous

SECTION 1. PURPOSE

This notice provides interim guidance, pending the issuance of forthcoming proposed regulations, relating to the credit for carbon oxide sequestration under section 45Q (§45Q credit) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code)1 in light of the Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA) proposed regulations to remove reporting obligations regarding the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide imposed under subpart RR of 40 CFR part 98 (subpart RR). See 90 F.R. 44591 (Sept. 16, 2025). Specifically, this notice provides a safe harbor for determining eligibility for the §45Q credit for qualified carbon oxide that is captured and disposed of in secure geological storage (and carbon oxide described in §1.45Q-2(h)(5)) and not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project during calendar year 2025 (Calendar Year 2025 Secure Geological Storage) in the event the EPA does not launch the electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT) for filers to prepare and submit information required under subpart RR for reporting year 2025 by June 10, 2026. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expect that the forthcoming proposed regulations will propose updated requirements for taxpayers claiming the credit for secure geological storage after the 2025 calendar year. Taxpayers may rely on the safe harbor and guidance described in section 3 of this notice to demonstrate compliance with the subpart RR requirements of §1.45Q-3(b)(1)(ii) or 1.45Q-2(h)(5)(iii), as applicable, and §1.45Q-3(d), for purposes of determining the §45Q credit with respect to 2025 Calendar Year Secure Geological Storage.

SECTION 2. BACKGROUND

.01 Section 45Q

(1) Section 45Q was added to the Code by §115 of Division B of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765, 3829 (Oct. 3, 2008). Section 45Q was amended a number of times thereafter, including most recently by §70522 of Public Law 119-21, 139 Stat. 72, 279 (July 4, 2025), commonly known as the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).2

(2) Section 45Q(a)(1) allows a credit of $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide (i) captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018; (ii) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage; and (iii) neither used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project nor utilized in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(3) Section 45Q(a)(2) allows a credit of $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide (i) captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018; and (ii) either (A) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage; or (B) utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(4) Section 45Q(a)(3) allows a credit of the applicable dollar amount (as determined under section 45Q(b)(1)) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service, and (i) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, (ii) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or (iii) utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(5) Section 45Q(f)(2) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate (Secretary), in consultation with the EPA, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior, to establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of qualified carbon oxide under section 45Q(a) such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Section 45Q(f)(2) further provides that the term “geological storage of qualified carbon oxide” includes storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.

(6) On June 2, 2020, the Treasury Department and the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-112339-19) in the Federal Register (85 F.R. 34050) under section 45Q. After consideration of all comments received in response to the proposed regulations, on January 15, 2021, the Treasury Department and the IRS, in consultation with the EPA, Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior, published final regulations in the Federal Register under section 45Q. See T.D. 9944; 86 F.R. 4728, as corrected in 86 F.R. 16530 (March 30, 2021).

(7) Section 1.45Q-3(a) provides that, in general, to qualify for the §45Q credit, a taxpayer must either physically or contractually dispose of captured qualified carbon oxide in secure geological storage in the manner provided in §1.45Q-3(b), or utilize qualified carbon oxide in a manner conforming with section 45Q(f)(5) and §1.45Q-4. Secure geological storage includes, but is not limited to, storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams.

(8) Section 1.45Q-3(b) provides that for purposes of the §45Q credit, qualified carbon oxide is considered disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere if the qualified carbon oxide is (1) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or federal waters, and (ii) is not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR; or (2) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, is located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or Federal waters, and (ii) is used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and stored in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR, or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, Carbon dioxide capture, transportation and geological storage — Carbon dioxide storage using enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) (CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019).

(9) Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) provides that, in general, carbon oxide that is injected into an oil reservoir that is not a qualified enhanced oil recovery project under section 43(c)(2) of the Code due to circumstances such as the first injection of a tertiary injectant occurring before 1991, or because a petroleum engineer's certification was not timely filed, cannot be treated as qualified carbon oxide, disposed of in secure geological storage, or utilized in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5). Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) does not apply to an oil reservoir if: (i) the reservoir has permanently ceased oil production; (ii) the operator has obtained an Underground Injection Control Class VI permit; and (iii) the operator complies with subpart RR.

(10) Section 1.45Q-3(d) provides that for qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer reported volumes of carbon oxide to the EPA pursuant to subpart RR, the taxpayer may self-certify the volume of qualified carbon oxide claimed for purposes of section 45Q. For qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer determined volumes pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, a taxpayer may prepare documentation as outlined in CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019 internally, but all such documentation must be provided to a qualified independent engineer or geologist, who then must certify that the documentation provided, including the mass balance calculations as well as information regarding monitoring and containment assurance, is accurate and complete. The qualified independent engineer or geologist certifying a project must be duly registered or certified in any State. The certification must contain an affidavit from the certifying engineer or geologist stating that he or she is independent from the taxpayer (and if an election under section 45Q(f)(3)(B) has been made, the affidavit must state that he or she is independent from both the electing taxpayer and the credit claimant). Certifications must be made annually and under penalties of perjury. For any leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide (as defined in §1.45Q-5(c)) that is determined pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, the certification must also include a statement that the quantity was determined in accordance with sound engineering principles. Taxpayers that capture and dispose of qualified carbon oxide giving rise to the §45Q credit must file Form 8933, Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, with a timely filed Federal income tax return or Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, including extensions or amendments to Federal income tax returns, Forms 1065, or on administrative adjustment requests under section 6227 (AARs), as applicable.

.02 EPA Regulations

(1) Under the Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, injection of carbon dioxide into any underground reservoir requires the operator to comply with Underground Injection Control (UIC) program regulations and to obtain the appropriate UIC well permits. The UIC program is designed to protect underground sources of drinking water from underground injection. Under 40 CFR §146.5 (Classification of injection wells), Class VI is an appropriate UIC well permit for wells that are not experimental in nature and that are used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide beneath the lowermost formation containing an underground source of drinking water; for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have been granted a waiver of the injection depth requirements pursuant to requirements at 40 CFR 146.95; or for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have received an expansion to the areal extent of an existing Class II enhanced oil recovery or enhanced gas recovery aquifer exemption pursuant to 40 CFR §§ 146.4 and 144.7(d).

(2) Operators that inject carbon dioxide underground are also subject to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) requirements set forth at 40 CFR Part 98. Under 40 CFR Part 98, facilities that inject carbon dioxide underground for long-term containment of carbon dioxide in subsurface geologic formations are specifically subject to subpart RR (Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide source category). Facilities that are subject to subpart RR, including UIC Class VI wells, are required to report basic information on carbon dioxide received for injection, develop and implement an EPA-approved site-specific Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification Plan, and report the amount of carbon dioxide geologically sequestered using a mass balance approach and annual monitoring activities. Such reports under subpart RR must be prepared on a calendar year basis (Annual Reports).

(3) Annual Reports generally must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for greenhouse gas emissions in the previous calendar year. 40 CFR §98.3(b). Annual Reports are required to be submitted electronically in a format specified by the Administrator of the EPA. 40 CFR §98.5(a). The EPA generally requires Annual Reports to be submitted through the EPA's electronic reporting system, e-GGRT. Historically, the EPA has launched the e-GGRT system in mid-February for a given reporting year. See EPA, “Extending the Reporting Deadline Under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for 2024 Data,” 90 F.R. 13085, 13087 (March 20, 2025). Annual Reports undergo verification by the EPA, and non-confidential data from these reports are published on the EPA's website.

(4) On September 16, 2025, the EPA issued proposed regulations, Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, 90 F.R. 44591, proposing to amend the GHGRP to remove program obligations for most source categories, including the obligations in subpart RR, for reporting years after 2024. The proposed regulations would also revise 40 CFR Part 98 subpart A to extend the Part 98 (including subpart RR) reporting deadline for reporting year 2025 from March 31, 2026, to June 10, 2026. The EPA has proposed that the amendments, if finalized, would become effective within sixty days of publication in the Federal Register. Because the proposed amendments would remove the reporting obligations under subpart RR following reporting year 2024, reporters would cease submitting Annual Reports within sixty days of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. 90 F.R. at 44603.

Part III — Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous

SECTION 1. PURPOSE

This notice provides interim guidance, pending the issuance of forthcoming proposed regulations, relating to the credit for carbon oxide sequestration under section 45Q (§45Q credit) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code)1 in light of the Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA) proposed regulations to remove reporting obligations regarding the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide imposed under subpart RR of 40 CFR part 98 (subpart RR). See 90 F.R. 44591 (Sept. 16, 2025). Specifically, this notice provides a safe harbor for determining eligibility for the §45Q credit for qualified carbon oxide that is captured and disposed of in secure geological storage (and carbon oxide described in §1.45Q-2(h)(5)) and not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project during calendar year 2025 (Calendar Year 2025 Secure Geological Storage) in the event the EPA does not launch the electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT) for filers to prepare and submit information required under subpart RR for reporting year 2025 by June 10, 2026. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expect that the forthcoming proposed regulations will propose updated requirements for taxpayers claiming the credit for secure geological storage after the 2025 calendar year. Taxpayers may rely on the safe harbor and guidance described in section 3 of this notice to demonstrate compliance with the subpart RR requirements of §1.45Q-3(b)(1)(ii) or 1.45Q-2(h)(5)(iii), as applicable, and §1.45Q-3(d), for purposes of determining the §45Q credit with respect to 2025 Calendar Year Secure Geological Storage.

SECTION 2. BACKGROUND

.01 Section 45Q

(1) Section 45Q was added to the Code by §115 of Division B of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765, 3829 (Oct. 3, 2008). Section 45Q was amended a number of times thereafter, including most recently by §70522 of Public Law 119-21, 139 Stat. 72, 279 (July 4, 2025), commonly known as the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).2

(2) Section 45Q(a)(1) allows a credit of $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide (i) captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018; (ii) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage; and (iii) neither used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project nor utilized in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(3) Section 45Q(a)(2) allows a credit of $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide (i) captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018; and (ii) either (A) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage; or (B) utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(4) Section 45Q(a)(3) allows a credit of the applicable dollar amount (as determined under section 45Q(b)(1)) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service, and (i) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, (ii) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or (iii) utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(5) Section 45Q(f)(2) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate (Secretary), in consultation with the EPA, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior, to establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of qualified carbon oxide under section 45Q(a) such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Section 45Q(f)(2) further provides that the term “geological storage of qualified carbon oxide” includes storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.

(6) On June 2, 2020, the Treasury Department and the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-112339-19) in the Federal Register (85 F.R. 34050) under section 45Q. After consideration of all comments received in response to the proposed regulations, on January 15, 2021, the Treasury Department and the IRS, in consultation with the EPA, Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior, published final regulations in the Federal Register under section 45Q. See T.D. 9944; 86 F.R. 4728, as corrected in 86 F.R. 16530 (March 30, 2021).

(7) Section 1.45Q-3(a) provides that, in general, to qualify for the §45Q credit, a taxpayer must either physically or contractually dispose of captured qualified carbon oxide in secure geological storage in the manner provided in §1.45Q-3(b), or utilize qualified carbon oxide in a manner conforming with section 45Q(f)(5) and §1.45Q-4. Secure geological storage includes, but is not limited to, storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams.

(8) Section 1.45Q-3(b) provides that for purposes of the §45Q credit, qualified carbon oxide is considered disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere if the qualified carbon oxide is (1) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or federal waters, and (ii) is not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR; or (2) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, is located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or Federal waters, and (ii) is used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and stored in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR, or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, Carbon dioxide capture, transportation and geological storage — Carbon dioxide storage using enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) (CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019).

(9) Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) provides that, in general, carbon oxide that is injected into an oil reservoir that is not a qualified enhanced oil recovery project under section 43(c)(2) of the Code due to circumstances such as the first injection of a tertiary injectant occurring before 1991, or because a petroleum engineer's certification was not timely filed, cannot be treated as qualified carbon oxide, disposed of in secure geological storage, or utilized in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5). Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) does not apply to an oil reservoir if: (i) the reservoir has permanently ceased oil production; (ii) the operator has obtained an Underground Injection Control Class VI permit; and (iii) the operator complies with subpart RR.

(10) Section 1.45Q-3(d) provides that for qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer reported volumes of carbon oxide to the EPA pursuant to subpart RR, the taxpayer may self-certify the volume of qualified carbon oxide claimed for purposes of section 45Q. For qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer determined volumes pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, a taxpayer may prepare documentation as outlined in CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019 internally, but all such documentation must be provided to a qualified independent engineer or geologist, who then must certify that the documentation provided, including the mass balance calculations as well as information regarding monitoring and containment assurance, is accurate and complete. The qualified independent engineer or geologist certifying a project must be duly registered or certified in any State. The certification must contain an affidavit from the certifying engineer or geologist stating that he or she is independent from the taxpayer (and if an election under section 45Q(f)(3)(B) has been made, the affidavit must state that he or she is independent from both the electing taxpayer and the credit claimant). Certifications must be made annually and under penalties of perjury. For any leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide (as defined in §1.45Q-5(c)) that is determined pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, the certification must also include a statement that the quantity was determined in accordance with sound engineering principles. Taxpayers that capture and dispose of qualified carbon oxide giving rise to the §45Q credit must file Form 8933, Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, with a timely filed Federal income tax return or Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, including extensions or amendments to Federal income tax returns, Forms 1065, or on administrative adjustment requests under section 6227 (AARs), as applicable.

.02 EPA Regulations

(1) Under the Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, injection of carbon dioxide into any underground reservoir requires the operator to comply with Underground Injection Control (UIC) program regulations and to obtain the appropriate UIC well permits. The UIC program is designed to protect underground sources of drinking water from underground injection. Under 40 CFR §146.5 (Classification of injection wells), Class VI is an appropriate UIC well permit for wells that are not experimental in nature and that are used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide beneath the lowermost formation containing an underground source of drinking water; for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have been granted a waiver of the injection depth requirements pursuant to requirements at 40 CFR 146.95; or for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have received an expansion to the areal extent of an existing Class II enhanced oil recovery or enhanced gas recovery aquifer exemption pursuant to 40 CFR §§ 146.4 and 144.7(d).

(2) Operators that inject carbon dioxide underground are also subject to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) requirements set forth at 40 CFR Part 98. Under 40 CFR Part 98, facilities that inject carbon dioxide underground for long-term containment of carbon dioxide in subsurface geologic formations are specifically subject to subpart RR (Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide source category). Facilities that are subject to subpart RR, including UIC Class VI wells, are required to report basic information on carbon dioxide received for injection, develop and implement an EPA-approved site-specific Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification Plan, and report the amount of carbon dioxide geologically sequestered using a mass balance approach and annual monitoring activities. Such reports under subpart RR must be prepared on a calendar year basis (Annual Reports).

(3) Annual Reports generally must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for greenhouse gas emissions in the previous calendar year. 40 CFR §98.3(b). Annual Reports are required to be submitted electronically in a format specified by the Administrator of the EPA. 40 CFR §98.5(a). The EPA generally requires Annual Reports to be submitted through the EPA's electronic reporting system, e-GGRT. Historically, the EPA has launched the e-GGRT system in mid-February for a given reporting year. See EPA, “Extending the Reporting Deadline Under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for 2024 Data,” 90 F.R. 13085, 13087 (March 20, 2025). Annual Reports undergo verification by the EPA, and non-confidential data from these reports are published on the EPA's website.

(4) On September 16, 2025, the EPA issued proposed regulations, Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, 90 F.R. 44591, proposing to amend the GHGRP to remove program obligations for most source categories, including the obligations in subpart RR, for reporting years after 2024. The proposed regulations would also revise 40 CFR Part 98 subpart A to extend the Part 98 (including subpart RR) reporting deadline for reporting year 2025 from March 31, 2026, to June 10, 2026. The EPA has proposed that the amendments, if finalized, would become effective within sixty days of publication in the Federal Register. Because the proposed amendments would remove the reporting obligations under subpart RR following reporting year 2024, reporters would cease submitting Annual Reports within sixty days of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. 90 F.R. at 44603.

Latest Cohort Is Program’s Biggest Yet, With Broad Geographic Representation

By Justin Daugherty, NLR

Remote and island communities face unique energy challenges—but these challenges also present unique opportunities to increase energy affordability, reliability, and security.

In their efforts to address their energy challenges, 38 coastal, remote, and island communities will receive support as part of the fifth cohort of the Energy Technology Innovation Partnership Project (ETIPP)—a U.S. Department of Energy technical assistance program led by the National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR), formerly known as NREL.

ETIPP connects selected communities with national energy experts who provide technical analysis, modeling, and decision support to identify energy reliability and affordability solutions best suited to each community’s needs.

Several new Gulf Coast and Great Lakes communities have joined the program this year, adding to the program’s regional expansion in 2024. The communities joining ETIPP’s fifth cohort strengthen the program’s presence across these regions, as well as in Alaska, the Caribbean territories, Hawaii and the Pacific territories, the Northeastern Seaboard, the Pacific Northwest, and the Southeastern Seaboard.

“We’re fortunate to be able to expand the program to so many communities this year,” said NLR’s Tessa Greco, ETIPP program manager. “The growth of the program showcases its value to coastal, remote, and island communities, while interest in the program highlights the energy challenges so many communities face.”

Proposed projects for Cohort 5 aim to strengthen energy systems against extreme weather events, explore options for new local generation, design microgrids to protect against outages, explore energy efficiency options, and more.

Communities in the early stages of energy planning will spend 4–8 months in ETIPP developing a strategic energy plan that clearly defines their energy goals and objectives. Those joining ETIPP with an existing energy plan or well-defined project will begin a 12–24-month process to analyze and validate specific energy solutions.

A team of national laboratory researchers and regional partner organizations will support ETIPP communities along the path, no matter which track they take. Energy experts at four national laboratories—Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the National Laboratory of the Rockies, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories—work with communities to find solutions tailored to local energy challenges. ETIPP communities also receive support from regional partners, who build connections between community members and the national laboratory complex and have the local knowledge to ensure that projects are meeting community needs.

In ETIPP’s first four cohorts, 57 communities analyzed reliable energy solutions, such as assessing localized energy generation and storage options, optimizing existing energy systems, or analyzing energy efficiency and weatherization options for existing infrastructure.

“Load growth is accelerating, driven by data centers, transportation demand, and industrial expansion.
The report, published Monday, precedes a “mitigation” planning process to be undertaken by the Illinois Power Agency.
According to the state’s 2024 report, 27 data centers had received incentives totaling $983 million in tax breaks and benefits.
Advocates also called for the renewal of a proposal requiring data centers to power themselves with renewable energy, which stalled in the spring.","Illinois’ electric grids may soon face power shortages and further price increases as fossil fuel plants go offline and data centers fueling the rise of artificial intelligence demand ever-increasing amounts of power.

That’s the conclusion of a new report by three state agencies that foreshadows an upcoming state grid planning process and a potential legislative fight on how lawmakers will regulate power-hungry data centers, if at all.

The projected shortfalls would begin in the Commonwealth Edison service territory in northern Illinois by 2029 and in the Ameren service area that covers most of downstate Illinois by 2031. They’d continue to worsen and make Illinois more reliant on energy imports without action by state policymakers or grid operators.

“The challenges emerge from a combination of factors at the regional and national scale,” the report noted. “Load growth is accelerating, driven by data centers, transportation demand, and industrial expansion. At the same time, many coal, gas, and oil units are planned to retire across both RTOs (regional transmission organizations) due to age, economics, and emissions limits.”

The warning from the Illinois Power Agency, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Commerce Commission came the same week that prices once again rose at a procurement event in the area that serves northern Illinois consumers.

Read the report: 2025 Resource Adequacy Study (PDF)

Advocates behind recent renewable energy reforms and the governor who says he will sign them argue the report’s findings prove that a plan passed by lawmakers in October was essential to avoiding a potential crisis.

“The state set up a deliberate process to address findings from this resource adequacy study and ensure Illinois continues to lead the country in delivering a clean, reliable, affordable energy future for all,” Gov. JB Pritzker’s office said in a statement.

Critics, including the state’s manufacturers, say the report makes clear that Illinois’ decarbonization policies were overly ambitious.

“We didn’t need a 222-page report to tell us what we already know — Illinois is facing an energy crisis resulting from the forced closure of dispatchable baseload generation and growing demand,” Mark Denzler, president & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said in a statement.

Grid planning and capacity

Warnings of the potential shortfall were contained in the most recent resource adequacy report that state regulators are required to file under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA, energy overhaul passed in 2021. The report, published Monday, precedes a “mitigation” planning process to be undertaken by the Illinois Power Agency.

One of the marquee measures in CEJA called for taking all of the state’s fossil fuel generators offline by 2045, but the plan also created the less-heralded resource adequacy process to assess whether that timeline is feasible.

While the resource adequacy report didn’t specifically call for walking back CEJA’s mandatory 2045 fossil fuel plant closure timeline, that possibility could be considered as regulators prepare the mitigation plan and embark on another major grid planning process in 2026.

But even if Illinois delays closure dates, it’s going to need new generators, the report noted.

Another measure the governor has pledged to sign, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, aims to add battery generation to the grid while creating other energy efficiency and planning processes.

CRGA — Illinois’ third major energy and decarbonization bill passed since 2016 — requires the Illinois Commerce Commission to conduct an integrated resource planning process in 2026. The report noted the goal is to “provide a more comprehensive venue for addressing many of the foundational issues” in grid reliability.

“While this study underscores serious challenges, Illinois has already taken steps to address resource adequacy — a problem the entire country is facing,” Solar Powers Illinois, an advocacy group for the state’s solar industry that backed CRGA, said in a statement. The group added that integrated resource planning will be a “a transparent, data-driven process to evaluate supply and demand, identify risks, and secure cost-effective solutions.”

Problems go beyond Illinois

While Illinois will begin that planning effort next year, the issues facing the state’s grids are not unique. The two multistate, federally regulated regional transmission organizations that serve Illinois — PJM Interconnection in northern Illinois and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator everywhere else — face their own challenges with out-of-state plant closures and growing load demands.

At any rate, the report noted, if the grid can’t replace retiring resources in a timely fashion, it would increase grid strain and lead to higher prices at capacity auctions, a cost that would be borne by consumers.

“If regional markets remain short, Illinois will face persistent high capacity prices even if it builds new resources in-state,” the report noted.

PJM serves 67 million customers in 13 states and Washington, D.C., including 4.2 million Commonwealth Edison customers in northern Illinois, making it the largest grid operator in the U.S.

On Wednesday, it announced the results of its most recent auction for “capacity,” which describes payments ratepayers make to power generators to ensure grid reliability. Capacity charges make up roughly 20% of a monthly power bill.

The price per megawatt-day at the most recent PJM auction hit a record of $333.44 for 2027-28, up $4.27 from the previous year but still 11.5 times higher than just three years prior.

The Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois consumer advocacy group, said the news shows the capacity market “is breaking under the weight of data center demand and a dysfunctional interconnection queue.”

PJM’s interconnection queue largely dictates how quickly new generators can come online, and advocates and the governor have long called for reforms. The report noted it has improved since PJM created new processes in 2023.

But it still takes five to seven years to get gas turbines online, while siting and permitting can also cause delays. The report also noted supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and domestic content requirements for tax credit eligibility could also delay wind and solar coming online.

“Without real reforms, in just a few years 67 million electric customers in the PJM footprint could face rolling blackouts and an escalation of power bills that make the current price spikes seem tame,” CUB Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz said in a statement.

Report’s recommendations

As fossil fuel plants in Illinois go offline due to CEJA’s mandates, it could make the state reliant on importing energy from other zones within the regional transmission organizations — even as the RTOs themselves face shortfalls.

Because of that, the state will need new generation “even if Illinois retains a portion of its existing thermal fleet.” To address the potential shortages, Illinois must employ a “diversified resource strategy,” according to the report.

“This includes combining continued growth of new in-state wind and solar supported by IPA procurements and programs, greater use of existing and planned transmission to import power from MISO and PJM when available, and the continued use of fueled thermal generators as reliability assets even as their energy output declines with higher renewable penetration,” the report noted.

Other potential resources cited in the report include “green hydrogen,” nuclear fission reactors, utility-scale solar, onshore wind and four-hour lithium-ion batteries.

The CRGA, which passed the state legislature in October and the governor said he will sign, creates a new incentive structure for energy storage projects similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power.

Data centers and advocate response

The advocates behind CRGA say it was passed in large part because lawmakers understood the trends that were outlined in this week’s report. But renewable energy advocates like the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and consumer advocates like the CUB say it’s just as essential to regulate power-hungry data centers.

“The next critical step is to pass commonsense guardrails for data centers — the primary driver of the unprecedented energy demand that is saddling Illinois consumers with rising utility bills while dirty energy companies make record profits,” the Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement.

The influential coalition, which includes union, faith and environmental groups, said it will work with lawmakers “to ensure data center developers, not Illinois consumers, pay for the disproportionate energy burden big tech is bringing to our power grid.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t directly respond to questions about what data center regulations, if any, the governor and lawmakers will consider in the spring.

Illinois has provided tax incentives for data centers since Pritzker signed bipartisan legislation in 2019. According to the state’s 2024 report, 27 data centers had received incentives totaling $983 million in tax breaks and benefits.

The National Resources Defense Council estimated data centers will drive up costs for PJM consumers by another $163 billion through 2033 and increase monthly bills by about $70 by 2028.

The Citizens Utility Board called on PJM to clean up its interconnection queue while urging states to force data centers to reduce operations or use on-site backup battery systems when electricity is in high demand. Advocates also called for the renewal of a proposal requiring data centers to power themselves with renewable energy, which stalled in the spring.

“Data center companies are among the wealthiest in the world, and it is simply unconscionable that customers should pay unbearably high power costs to foot the bill for data center energy guzzling,” Moskowitz said.

The Manufacturers’ Association have long called for a repeal of CEJA’s closure date to reduce uncertainty. The group called for an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes keeping fossil duels online.

“If skyrocketing power bills were not warning enough, this new report is a flashing red sign that Illinois needs to act immediately,” Denzler said in a statement. “With electricity demand only expected to increase, we simply cannot risk the chaos that would be caused by the premature closure of baseload generation plants as required under current law.”",https://i0.wp.com/capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/240912-TRANSMISSION-LINES-AA-0025.jpg?fit=1140%2C760&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-19 21:59:21.048608

“The SPEED Act would eviscerate NEPA’s protections.” Food and Water Watch outlined several ways the bill would weaken the law.
“The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for,” Salazar said.
Opposition to the SPEED Act came amid criticism of other House actions viewed as favoring extractive industries.
Public Citizen also pointed to the House’s recent passage of the Power Plant Reliability Act and the Reliable Power Act.","The legislation, known as the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, passed the House with support from Democratic Reps. Jim Costa of California, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, Adam Gray of California, John Mannion of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Marc Veasey of Texas. All Republicans present voted in favor except Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.

The bill is spearheaded by Golden and House Committee on Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman of Arkansas. Critics argue the vote marks a significant bipartisan effort to roll back NEPA, which is often described as the “Magna Carta” of federal environmental laws because it requires environmental review and public participation before major federally permitted projects move forward.

In a statement following the vote, Food and Water Watch legal director Tarah Heinzen said the measure would fundamentally undermine those protections. “For decades, NEPA has ensured logical decision-making and community involvement when the federal government considers projects that could harm people and the environment,” Heinzen said. “The SPEED Act would eviscerate NEPA’s protections.”

Food and Water Watch outlined several ways the bill would weaken the law. According to the group, the SPEED Act would drastically limit the scope of projects subject to environmental review, potentially allowing factory farms, coal plants, and other polluting facilities to build or expand without comprehensive analysis or meaningful public input. The bill would also impose unusually short deadlines for legal challenges and restrict courts’ ability to stop unlawful projects. Opponents say it would further tilt decision making toward corporate interests by limiting agencies’ ability to rely on the best available science when evaluating environmental and health risks.

“Today’s absurd House vote is yet another handout to corporate polluters at the expense of everyday people who have to live with the real-world impacts of toxic pollution from dirty industries like fossil fuels and factory farms,” Heinzen said. “This nonsense must be dead on arrival in the Senate.”

Other environmental advocates echoed that warning and urged senators to block the bill. Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, said that “renewable energy and climate advocates in the Senate must hold the line against the SPEED Act’s evisceration of our bedrock environmental and community protection law.”

Allie Rosenbluth, US campaign manager for Oil Change International, said the legislation threatens both environmental safeguards and democratic participation. “Our senators must stand up against the SPEED Act’s attempts to undermine democratic decision-making, pollute our communities, and threaten our collective future,” she said.

Advocates for communities living near industrial development warned that the bill would deepen long-standing environmental inequities. James Hiatt of For a Better Bayou said the SPEED Act “protects corporate interests, not the public, and it should be rejected by any senator who claims to stand with the people.”

Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright, co-coordinator of the Black Alliance for Peace’s Climate, Environment, and Militarism Initiative, framed the legislation as part of a broader pattern of environmental harm imposed on marginalized communities. He warned that the bill “represents yet another assault on the health of frontline, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor white communities that have been designated as sacrifice zones by big polluters who bribe lawmakers with big money to continue a culture of extract, slash, burn, and emit at the expense of oppressed and marginalized peoples.”

Rogers-Wright said Congress should pursue a different approach. “Rather than speeding up the approval of dirty projects, Congress should increase funding for federal agencies and grassroots organizations accountable to frontline communities to carry out legally defensible and accurate environmental analyses,” he said, pointing to the Environmental Justice for All Act.

That legislation was also highlighted by Mar Zepeda Salazar, legislative director at Climate Justice Alliance. “The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for,” Salazar said. She added that Congress should instead advance policies that ensure meaningful public engagement, protect public health, respect tribal sovereignty, and honor consultation obligations with federally recognized tribal nations.

“Examples include the Environmental Justice for All Act, which lays out meaningful public engagement, strong public health protections, respect for tribal sovereignty and consultation obligations, and serious investments in agencies and staff,” Salazar said.

Opposition to the SPEED Act came amid criticism of other House actions viewed as favoring extractive industries. Lauren Pagel, policy director at Earthworks, said the House also passed the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which “will remove already-scarce protections for natural resources and sacred cultural sites in US mining law.”

“Today’s House votes are a step backwards for our nation, but we continue to stand firm for the rights of the people and places on the frontlines of oil, gas, and mining,” Pagel said.

Public Citizen also pointed to the House’s recent passage of the Power Plant Reliability Act and the Reliable Power Act. David Arkush, director of the group’s Climate Program, said the measures moving through Congress “under the guise of ‘bipartisan permitting reform’ are blatant handouts to the fossil fuel and mining industries.”

As the SPEED Act moves to the Senate, environmental groups say the House vote underscores a growing push to weaken environmental review in the name of faster permitting, even as communities across the country face worsening pollution and climate impacts.

Indiana Coal Plant Closures in Limbo as Federal Emergency Powers and Coal Ash Extensions Loom

Two coal power plants in Indiana are scheduled to shut down in 2025. These retirements are part of broader trends to phase out older, inefficient coal units in favor of cleaner energy sources. But now, those closures may not be allowed to happen.

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy has begun using emergency powers to keep coal plants running in the name of grid reliability, even when state utilities say they’re no longer needed. Governor Mike Braun has raised concerns about electricity demand and has signaled support for reviewing whether coal plants should stay online longer. Yet grid experts have failed to show clear evidence that these specific plants are needed to prevent blackouts.

Keeping these coal plants open means continued air pollution, climate pollution, and delayed environmental cleanup for Indiana communities.

While these concerns are enough to raise alarm bells, there’s another factor in play. At this same time, the EPA is considering whether to give one of these utilities more time to continue disposing of toxic coal ash. Coal ash is a toxic waste produced by coal plants. One utility is asking regulators for permission to delay cleanup and keep disposing of coal ash in unlined ponds for another five years, just in case the plant is forced to keep running. This practice is linked to contaminating groundwater with harmful heavy metals, like arsenic, mercury, hexavalent chromium, and, lead. Even low level exposure to these is linked to cancer, respiratory issues, and neurological problems. The EPA is considering granting these extensions through 2031, which would make it easier to keep operating a plant that was supposed to close.

This is a major decision involving federal agencies, state leadership, and utility companies that could affect Indiana’s public health, economy, and environment, and set a precedent for coal plant retirements nationwide. Emergency orders undermine utilities’ and states’ clean-energy plans and slow nationwide retirements of outdated fuel production.

The public comment period on the coal ash extension runs through early January 2026. Its outcome could influence how long coal plants can legally operate. Utilities discussions and state regulatory hearings about coal plant reliability and retirement planning will continue into early 2026.

Establishing an informed generation of future environmental stewards starts with a clear approach. Public school teacher and author Kimi Waite is making the case that if we’re serious about solving climate change, we need to start teaching environmental justice in elementary schools—and she’s already proven it works with kindergarteners.

Waite suggests that teaching environmental justice gives students the tools to understand how pollution and racism intersect in their own neighborhoods—and what they can do about it. She points to recent state-level policies to include climate change instruction for all K-12 students as a step in the right direction, but says it needs to go further by explicitly including justice and equity in these lessons.

The current administration has consistently dismantled environmental resources that teachers and students rely on. The White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council was disbanded and the federal mapping tools that helped visualize connections between race, poverty, and pollution exposure were removed from the EPA website earlier this year. These are the sources educators rely on to incorporate environmental justice into conversations about weather, climate, and communities. When the author taught kindergarten in South Los Angeles, her five and six-year-old students used federal mapping tools to research air pollution in their own community. In math class, they created bar charts comparing pollution across neighborhoods of varying income levels. The lesson wasn’t just about science or math—it was about understanding systemic patterns and empowering young people to become what she calls “data detectives.”

Waite emphasizes that climate change can’t be taught without teaching about justice, because climate impacts hit marginalized communities hardest. This means weaving environmental justice across all subjects—art, social studies, math, science, even physical education—so students understand the root causes of the climate crisis, including systemic racism.

As districts figure out how to implement climate education requirements, the question isn’t just whether students learn about climate change—it’s whether they learn to see the connections between environmental harm and inequality, and whether they’re equipped to do something about it. Kimi Waite’s book on this topic, “Teaching Environmental Justice in the Elementary Classroom: Entry Points for Equity Across the K–5 Curriculum” will be published in February 2026.

For Pueblo Communities, Climate Resilience Begins With Language and Land

The Pueblo in New Mexico go a step beyond climate resilience with a practice of climate reverence. Jim E-note, makes the connection between Indigenous language and the ties to land as it seemingly speaks to him.

As quoted in Sierra’s winter magazine (2025) Enote states that language is (quote) “the breath of the wind, the timing of the snowmelt and the silence before the summer monsoons”(endQ)

Water issues are a grave concern nearly everywhere today, be it excess or scarcity! Drought has long been a serious concern in the Southwest U.S.—Enote relied on a tradition of the naming of locations within their territory to discover and recover a spring after a long-used natural spring in his native land ran dry. To him, as a Zuni farmer, he maintains that land and language are inseparable. Not only are expanding populations in cities in the Southwest depleting aquifers but historically there is evidence of extreme droughts that led to relocating ancient settlements to have water access.

Enote’s foundation, “Colorado Plateau,” finances native-led climate solutions in that desert region. It has resulted in greater unity among Pueblo tribes. Harmony among the native farmers and with nature is an encouraging outcome of listening to the land and those most able to interpret its meaning.

Trump Administration Moves to Dismantle National Weather and Climate Research Center

The climate community is in an uproar due to the most recent cuts from the Trump administration. It was just announced through X (formerly Twitter) that the administration is breaking up a 65-year-old research center in Colorado that’s been central to nearly every weather forecast and climate study in America.

The National Center for Atmospheric Research (or NCAR) in Boulder has been studying weather and climate since 1960, and developed some of the more significant technology used in predicting weather patterns. NCAR developed the instrument dropped from planes into hurricanes to help predict where storms will hit and how strong they’ll be. The center also created weather models used to forecast tornadoes, floods, and severe storms.

Now the administration says it’s dismantling the center, accusing it of being “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country.” They say vital functions like weather modeling will move somewhere else, but have not confirmed where or how this will take place. Scientists and lawmakers are deeply concerned by this announcement. Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, called dismantling NCAR “like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet.”

This decision seems to be targeting the Colorado state representatives, including the governor, who have refused to be complicit in other regulatory pressures, and these legislators are fighting back. They say that shutting down the facility would be deeply dangerous, cause massive job loss, and sacrifice America’s safety and standing in weather research globally. The ripples of this closure will compromise college and universities’ abilities to conduct climate research, and prevent NCAR from effectively monitoring air quality, anticipating droughts and extreme precipitation events, or accurately forecasting hurricane intensity.

NCAR works closely with federal partners like NOAA and NASA (both of which have received massive financial hits from the Trump administration over the last 12 months). NCA provides these institutions with scientific tools, computer models and data that help inform decisions regarding public safety, natural resources and environmental management. Dismantling NCAR will continue the degradation of climate research and community preparedness. As Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research says, this attack on NCAR is just another step in the Trump administration’s “attempts to cancel the freedom of scientific thought. … That should provide a shiver down the spine of every U.S. citizen.”

The Georgia Public Service Commission Friday unanimously approved an expansion deal for Georgia Power expected to cost at least $15 billion. In order to meet rising demand the utility is predicting from large customers, mostly data centers, Georgia Power will build gas turbines and batteries and purchase energy, adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of electricity to its grid.

After several rounds of hearings on the controversial proposal and more than an hour of public comments Friday morning, commission Chair Jason Shaw called for a vote. He was met with shouts.

“Nay nay nay! The people say nay!” shouted a group of protesters as they were escorted from the hearing room.

The five commissioners then all voted “aye.”

Under the deal they approved, Georgia Power is promising “downward pressure” of $8.50 per month for the “typical” residential customer, which means someone using 1,000 kwh of electricity a month. That promise, which will apply in 2028 when the utility next brings a rate case before the commission, does not guarantee a rate reduction. Rather, it means that whatever rates the company requests will be offset by that amount.

“We know every dollar counts. This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” wrote Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene in a statement. “Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians.”

All of this hinges on the data centers: The massive buildout of energy capacity will serve their high electricity needs, and the influx of revenue they’re expected to bring in will pay for the downward pressure on rates. But critics worry that the data centers might not materialize or could relocate in a few years. That could leave ordinary Georgians paying for the new infrastructure for decades.

Commissioner Tim Echols told WABE before the vote that customers will be protected.

“Even if a company does go bankrupt or they scale back what they’re using, we’re going to extract a pound of flesh from them and the ratepayers are gonna get that back,” he said.

Georgia Power, the commission’s staff and the commissioners themselves point to several assurances that data centers and other new, large customers will pay for their own infrastructure. Earlier this year, the commission approved new contract terms that allow the utility to require minimum monthly payments from large customers for 15 years, regardless of how much electricity they actually use and whether they stay in Georgia. The utility has also begun requiring collateral from the new prospective customers.

In hearings last week, Georgia Power said that even after the commission approves the new resources, the utility can delay or cancel projects it doesn’t end up needing. But that will be more difficult now that this deal is approved, said Sierra Club Staff Attorney Isabella Ariza.

“Everything after today, or after the final order stands firm, will be a higher threshold for interveners, for the general public to get any dollar denied from recovery,” she said. “The best bet was to deny the resources now, and the most conservative approach would have been to do that.”

This was the final vote for Echols and Commissioner Fitz Johnson, who both lost elections to Democratic challengers last month. The new commissioners take office in January.","https://imagedelivery.net/NnAlC-9876HVVqBQoPI2BA/www.wabe.org/2025/12/AP25353689042043-e1766182805333.jpg/w=1440,h=810",N,,2025-12-19 20:58:25.780997

Originally published in and reprinted with permission of Common Dreams.

As Congress recesses this week without reauthorizing the Affordable Care Act subsidies needed by millions of Americans, it also quietly gave the oil industry a multimillion dollar tax break by allowing the 9 cent-per-barrel oil tax (on domestic and imported oil) into the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to expire as well on December 31. The OSLTF, administered by the Coast Guard’s National Pollution Funds Center, is the nation’s central financial instrument for oil spill prevention and response, earning about $500 million per year from the nominal excise oil tax—about 0.1% of annual US oil industry revenue.

In our current political climate prioritizing industry over public interest, many feared that Congress and the Trump administration might simply allow the oil spill tax to expire, as a “Return on Investment” for industry contributions made to their political campaigns. Congress did just that. As they increase costs for millions of Americans, the Republican congress and administration are decreasing costs for some of the richest companies in the world.

For decades, Congress and the administration have remained stubbornly resistant to using the OSLTF to fund necessary oil spill prevention measures across the nation, and as tax revenue and spill damage recoveries continued to be collected, the fund balance has now grown to over $10 billion. Since the fund’s use for a single oil spill is limited to $1.5 billion, we have long proposed that a substantial portion of the remaining balance be used to better prevent oil pollution across the nation. Instead of just leaving all of this money in the bank, it should be put to work, while saving enough (perhaps $5 billion) for conventional oil spill response activities.

A transcendent lesson learned in all major oil spills around the world is that once oil is spilled, there is precious little that can be done to limit environmental damage. Historically, an average of 2-6% of total spill volume is actually recovered in major marine oil spills (Deepwater Horizon was about 4%, Exxon Valdez about 8%). These multibillion dollar spill responses may look good for oil company and government public relations, but they are virtually irrelevant in limiting environmental harm. Prevention is key to environmental protection.

As a fundamental cause of the 1989 Exxon Valdez and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disasters was inadequate government oversight, expanding drilling while cutting oversight is as reckless as it gets.

Spill prevention measures across the nation in need of more funding include enhanced Vessel Traffic Systems, escort-rescue tugs to prevent groundings and collisions of tankers and cargo ships in dangerous passages (e.g. the March 2024 cargo ship Dali collision with the Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore Harbor), enhanced inspection of oil and liquefied natural gas tankers, and so on. However, the federal government has resisted using the fund for such preventive measures.

With the OSLTF tax expiration approaching this summer, we proposed that the fund’s 9 cent-per-barrel tax on domestic and imported crude oil (less than 0.2% of today’s crude oil price, or less than one cent-per-gallon of gasoline) be fully reauthorized, and that the fund’s use for many oil spill prevention measures be significantly expanded. Congress and the administration were unresponsive, raising suspicions that they intended to allow the oil tax to expire, which they just did.

One proposed use for the fund is to safely cap and decommission the millions of derelict, abandoned oil and gas wells across the nation, both onshore and offshore. Regarding these orphaned and abandoned oil wells, a 2021 scientific paper found that, of the 4,700,000 historic and active oil and gas wells across the US, only 1 in 3 (1,500,000) are considered safely plugged. Leakage from improperly abandoned oil and gas wells causes groundwater and air pollution, ecological damage, risk of explosions, and damage to human health.

Costs for well decommissioning and abandonment have been estimated to range from $10,000-$50,000 to plug old, shallow wells; $300,000 for newer, deeper wells; and up to $1 million for more complex wells. In a 2015 study, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated the cost to securely decommission the thousands of deepwater oil and gas wells in the US Gulf of Mexico (two-thirds of the 5,000 wells in the Gulf of Mexico are in deep water) at $38.2 billion. The GAO study reported that, of the $38.2 billion in decommissioning liabilities, $2.3 billion were not covered by existing financial assurances; and of the remaining $35.9 billion in decommissioning liabilities, the federal government held $2.9 billion in bonds and other assurances, while waiving the remaining $33 billion for companies that passed a “financial strength test.” The GAO expressed concern about such extensive waivers of financial assurances, as this exposes the federal government to substantial future costs.

Clearly, abandoned oil and gas wells present enormous oil pollution risk, public safety hazard, and substantial government financial liability that we as a nation have ignored for too long. We have to do better, and using the OSLTF for this purpose would clearly be in the national interest.

Further, while the Trump administration recently proposed opening virtually the entire US Outer Continental Shelf (more than 1 billion acres of the nation’s offshore waters) to oil and gas drilling, it slashed the budget for the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) by roughly 35%, from $220 million to just $143 million. As a fundamental cause of the 1989 Exxon Valdez and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disasters was inadequate government oversight, expanding drilling while cutting oversight is as reckless as it gets. Thus, an important use for the federal oil spill fund should be to expand BSEE’s budget, as it is largely focused on preventing catastrophic oil spills from the nation’s several thousand offshore oil rigs. There are countless other cost-effective pollution prevention measures as well that need OSLTF funding.

But with Congress and the Trump administration ignoring these real funding needs, and allowing the oil tax to expire (as a gift to their oil industry contributors), the nation remains exposed to unnecessary risk of continued oil pollution, including small chronic releases, as well as major disasters like the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon. So much for “government efficiency.” Hopefully Congress will come to its senses in 2026, and fix what it just broke.",https://peer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Commentary-1-12-19-25-common-dreams-oil-tax.png,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:44.611202

""This measure will encourage state regulators to push our grid to more expensive, polluting sources of energy,"" said Rep. Kevin Mullin, D- Calif.

The power industry has consistently voiced concerns about base load capacity and reliability as older, coal-fired power plants are being retired and replaced by natural gas plants, which are cheaper to operate.

About 16% of the country's energy comes from coal-fired power plants. In the late 1990's it accounted for over 50%.

""Under the Biden administration, regulators like the EPA prioritized rules that would have caused the premature retirement of the nation's coal fleet during the same time period when electricity load growth is exploding because of artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification of the economy,"" said America's Power.

Prices have steadily risen for natural gas throughout 2025, for residents and industry alike, and Louisiana finds itself at the center of the boom. A nation-leading three liquified natural gas export facilities operate along its coast, and five more are in the construction or planning phases.

But more LNG exports will mean higher domestic utility prices, according to a new report from the consumer advocacy group, Public Citizen.

Public Citizen analyzed documents from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and determined natural gas prices are increasing for American households as gas companies in the U.S. export more of the commodity to meet global demand.

From January through September, Americans paid $12 billion more for natural gas than the same period last year. That comes to about $124 per family in higher utility bills, a 22% increase directly related to higher natural gas prices, the report notes.

Natural gas prices for consumers are expected to increase another 16% in 2026, according to Public Citizen, which cited U.S. Energy Information Administration predictions.

Analysts attribute growing global demand for natural gas to political, industrial and environmental factors.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led other countries, mostly European, to seek other sources of the fuel, which is widely preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal.

The rise of artificial intelligence has caused a surge in the construction of data centers that require vast amounts of electricity that is most likely to come from power plants that run on natural gas.

An LSU Center for Energy Studies outlook for 2026 credits much of the state’s growth in natural gas exports to executive orders from the Trump administration that lifted a Biden-era moratorium on expansion of LNG export facilities.

The United States exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG around the globe in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Louisiana handled around 61% of those shipments.

LNG exports are expected to “more than double by 2037, with nearly all new export capacity located on the Gulf Coast,” according to the LSU report’s analysis of Energy Information Administration predictions.

“As we continue to see more production, more capacity for exports, particularly in the LNG space, that’s going to mean more jobs,” said Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. “Somebody is going to supply that gas. Louisiana gets to benefit from the investments in the export capacity.”

But with increased exports comes the tradeoff of higher domestic prices for residents, according to the Public Citizen report.

The majority of Louisiana’s electricity, around 70%, is generated from natural gas, according to the most recent numbers from the Energy Information Administration. It costs about 12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity for residential, natural gas-fueled power in Louisiana, compared with the 18-cent national average.

Utilities pass along the increased cost of electricity generation to their customers, often through what’s called a fuel adjustment charge on their utility bills. They also include charges to recoup the costs of any losses or investments such as new power lines or infrastructure upgrades. Although Louisiana has low rates for its electricity, it hasn’t translated to low power bills because of these pass-along costs to customers.

“Whatever amount of gas they’re using to generate the electricity that’s being used in your home, the cost of that gas is being charged directly to you,” said Jesse George, policy lead for the Alliance for Affordable Energy.

In some areas such as New Orleans, an area with older, less energy-efficient homes, residents will feel the higher prices in 2026, George said.

Colder temperatures create more power demand, and natural gas prices tend to increase when utilities need more fuel to increase their generation. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 22% increase in natural gas prices for the winter heating season that runs through March.

Though heightened winter electricity demand in Louisiana typically ends by March, customers could see additional fuel surcharges on their utility bills for months if there is a severe cold snap. The same situation arises during intense summer heat,

“About 20% of households cannot pay their utility bills already,” George said, citing the most recent numbers available from Entergy New Orleans’ disconnection rates. “Couple that with these increased fuel prices, and that certainly will only exacerbate the problems and the challenges that people are facing already.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/louisiana_illuminator_articles_680/34badc06881e5ccc0b921be56370d4b3,N,,2025-12-19 19:59:36.875202

If finalized, the rule would implement the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA, discussed in a prior SPR blog post.

The Agencies note that the Proposed Rule marks a significant departure from the Agencies’ past practice, where “impacts” were considered in defining the scope of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”). The Agencies assert that, as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett, they will now solely define EPA’s jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act based on “‘the Act’s allocation of authority’ between the Federal Government and the States.”

Proposed Regulatory Text

The Proposed Rule would amend 33 CFR 328 (Army Corps) and 40 CFR 120 (EPA) to redefine WOTUS to include:

(1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas (40 CFR 120.2(a)(1), 33 CFR 328(a)(1));

(2) most impoundments of WOTUS (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(2), 33 CFR 328(a)(2));

(3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(3), 33 CFR 328(a)(3));

(4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(4), 33 CFR 328(a)(4)); and

(5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(5), 33 CFR 328(a)(5)).

Key Definitions and Interpretations

To implement this new definition of WOTUS, the Proposed Rule defines several new or revised terms:

“Continuous surface connection” is defined to mean ‘‘having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.’’

“Tributary” is defined to mean “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and banks, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow. A tributary does not include a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through a feature such as a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature, subterranean river, culvert, dam, tunnel, or similar artificial feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, wetland, or similar natural feature, if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow. When the tributary is part of a water transfer (as that term is applied under 40 CFR 122.3) currently in operation, the tributary would retain jurisdictional status.”

“Relatively permanent” is defined to mean ‘‘standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.’’

Although not defined in the Proposed Rule, the Agencies assert the below terms and phrases contained within this definition are meant to encompass specific meanings.

‘‘At least during the wet season’’ is intended to include “extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season.”

‘‘Standing” bodies of surface water are meant to encompass “lakes, ponds, and similar features that have standing water year-round or at least during the wet season and that are part of the tributary system.”

‘‘Continuously flowing’’ waterbodies are meant to encompass streams, rivers, ditches, and similar features considered under the WOTUS tributaries category.

Removal of “Interstate Waters” as a Standalone Category

The Agencies propose removing “interstate waters” as a separate category of WOTUS (currently included in 40 CFR 120.2(a)(1)(iii) and 33 CFR 328.3(a)(1)(iii)). The Agencies claim such removal is necessary because the “interstate waters” category can encompass bodies of water that are not “relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing or that are not themselves connected to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” Under the Proposed Rule, interstate waters would therefore only be ‘‘waters of the United States’’ if they fall within another jurisdictional category in the WOTUS new definition. Based on similar reasoning, the Proposed Rule would also delete “interstate” from the WOTUS category for lakes and ponds (40 CFR 120.2(a)(5) and 33 CFR 328(a)(5)).

Revised Exclusions and New Groundwater Exclusion

The Proposed Rule revises three of the eight exclusions from WOTUS (Water Treatment Exclusion: 40 CFR 120.2 (b)(1) and 33 CFR 328.3(b)(1); Prior Converted Cropland Exclusion: 40 CFR 120.2(b)(2) and 33 CFR 328.3(b)(2); and Ditch Exclusion: 40 CFR 120.2(b)(3) and 33 CFR 328.3(b)(3)) and adds a new explicit exclusion for “groundwater.” These exclusions would not apply to traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas.

Anticipated Impacts of the Proposed Rule

The Agencies anticipate that the Proposed Rule would result in an increase in non-jurisdictional findings in approved jurisdictional determinations (AJDs) compared to prior regulations and practice, and that fewer waters and wetlands would fall within the scope of the CWA. The Agencies predict that the Section 404 permitting program will be most impacted by the Proposed Rule, with projected reductions in the number of permits and required mitigation relative to the current regulations. However, the Agencies note that States and Tribes may choose to expand their own regulatory programs to include waters excluded from federal jurisdiction.

AJDs and permits issued under a previous WOTUS definitions will still be considered valid and would not necessarily be reopened if the Proposed Rule is adopted, unless requested by the landowner or applicant. Going forward, when making federal jurisdictional determinations regarding WOTUS, the Agencies have stated that they will make non-jurisdictional determinations if the agencies do not have adequate information to demonstrate that a water meets the new WOTUS jurisdictional standards.

Although the Proposed Rule is intended to “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase . . . predictability and consistency,” past revisions to the WOTUS definition have shown that we can expect increased litigation over the boundaries of federal and state jurisdiction and over the interpretation of the new definitions. Technical delineation by wetlands consultants is likely to become more complex and critical, and increased regulation by states and tribes may create new regulatory uncertainty.

Opportunities for Public Comment

In addition to seeking comments on the changes outlined above, the Agencies also request input on topics related to the Proposed Rule but that are not explicitly addressed in the proposed regulatory text. The regulatory community should consider commenting on these additional items to ensure all key issues are addressed during the public comment period. Such items include:

Whether “impacts” should be considered in determining CWA jurisdiction.

Whether to adopt an alternative approach to determining if a body of water meets the definition of “relatively permanent waters,” by using minimum flow volume thresholds, minimum flow duration metrics, or other bright line metrics set by region.

Whether to define ‘‘wet season’’ in the regulatory text, and whether the Agencies should adopt an alternative approach to implementing ‘‘wet season’’ for continuous surface connection by requiring surface water inundation for at least 90 or 270 days.

Whether an entire wetland would be considered ‘‘adjacent’’ if at least part of the wetland demonstrates a continuous surface connection to a jurisdictional water body during the wet season or whether, as proposed, only a portion of the wetland would be considered adjacent.

Whether the Agencies should adopt an alternative approach whereby wetlands, lakes, and ponds would have a ‘‘continuous surface connection’’ only if they abut, e., touch, a jurisdictional water and have a continuous surface water connection to that water, with continuous surface water connection meaning the perennial (year-round) presence of surface water.",https://sprlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog-Post-Graphics-15-12.png,N,,2025-12-19 23:58:22.325862

The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate in the fields of renewable energy and green hydrogen in June.

Kyuden International is a subsidiary of Kyushu Electric Power Corp, one of Japan’s regional utility companies, and the project marks its first investment in Egypt.

For AMEA Power, meanwhile, the project is the latest in a track record the developer is establishing quickly in Egypt.

The company commissioned Egypt’s first-ever large-scale BESS a few months ago, a 300MWh system at the 500MW Abydos Solar Project. The financing of that project was also supported with IFC funding.

AMEA Power is also on course to build the country’s first standalone battery storage projects. Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPAs) were signed early this year with the Egyptian government for a 500MWh system in the coastal village of Zafarana and for a 1,000MWh project in Benban on the banks of the Nile River.

Around the time that AMEA Power closed financing on the Abydos project, Norwegian developer Scatec secured US$479.1 million non-recourse financing from three development institutions for its Obelisk solar-plus-storage project in Egypt’s Nagaa Hammadi region.

Obelisk will feature 1.1GW of solar PV capacity, built in two phases, and a 100MW/200MWh BESS, which will be deployed as part of the first phase. Scatec announced equity deals for the project with Norwegian state-run investment fund Norfund and France’s EDF a few days ago.

JA Solar JV opens factory making solar, BESS products

In other news from Egypt, a joint venture (JV) led by vertically integrated Chinese solar PV module manufacturer JA Solar broke ground this week on a new solar PV cell, module and BESS manufacturing facility.

The US$210 million ATUM Solar complex in the Sokhna area of the Suez Canal Economic Zone will comprise three separate manufacturing facilities, our colleagues at PV Tech reported on Wednesday (17 December).

One of these will produce 2GW of solar PV cells annually, 100% for export. The other two will house lines producing 2GW of PV modules annually and 1GWh of energy storage systems, targeting local and regional markets.

The venture, which was formed this summer, is backed by four main bodies: JA Solar, as the technology investor; the Egyptian firm AH; the UAE investor Global South Utilities; and Infinity Capital from Bahrain.

Among the officials attending a groundbreaking ceremony on 15 December were Egypt’s deputy prime minister, Kamel El-Wazir, and Walid Gamal El-Din, chairman of the General Authority for the Suez Canal Economic Zone, both of whom emphasised the project’s role in creating local jobs and reducing Egypt’s reliance on imported clean energy products.

The state saw reductions in the number of residents without health insurance from 2018 to 2023 due to Medicaid expansion and growth in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).","In York County and Virginia Beach, a couple of 40-year-olds with two kids and a combined household income of $150,000 could see their health insurance premiums rise by $4,330 per year if the U.S. Senate and House fail to extend health insurance premium tax credits now set to expire on Dec. 31.

A similarly situated family in relatively affluent Albemarle County is looking at a yearly increase of $6,244 in premiums.

These estimates do not come from Democrats or Republicans. They come from a calculator prepared by KFF, the Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the country’s most reputable health policy organizations.

Experts predict that huge premium increases to households that would lose expired premium tax credits could leave as many as 100,000 Virginians uninsured.

The cost of human suffering by those forced into bankruptcy due to illness or those who forego treatment because they cannot afford to pay is hard to calculate. What is certain is that the increased cost will devastate people of all political persuasions.

This begs the question of why none of Virginia’s Republicans in the House of Representatives would sign a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill to extend the tax credits for three years.

Four Republicans, three from Pennsylvania and one from New York, joined 214 Democrats to force debate on the bill this week, after House Speaker Mike Johnson refused to include premium tax credits in a Republican health-care reform proposal Wednesday. Johnson then abruptly ended a 204-203 House vote that blocked quick consideration of the discharge bill before Congress adjourns for the holiday season on Friday.

Conspicuously missing from the list of GOP members challenging Johnson were two representatives from the Old Dominion.

First Congressional District U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, whose district includes York County, and Second Congressional District U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, whose district includes Virginia Beach, have each made, then broken, promises to go to the mat to control constituents’ health-care costs. Kiggans even co-sponsored a bill that would have extended health insurance premium tax credits for two years. It never came to a vote.

Wittman made no promise on premium tax credits. But like Kiggans, during federal budget negotiations he co-signed a letter to Johnson saying he would not vote for a federal budget that cut access to Medicaid, then, like Kiggans, did so twice.

Since then, Wittman and Kiggans have offered continuous pledges to make health care affordable. With their failure to support a discharge petition to force a vote on premium credits, they have once more betrayed constituents.

Both Republican incumbents risk losing their seats in Congress for ignoring constituents in health-care votes and for failing to hold President Donald Trump accountable for economic policies such as tariffs that have already raised the costs of goods and services for those they represent.

Since November’s Democratic sweep of statewide offices and increased control of both chambers of the state legislature, talk has focused on whether Virginia will redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats as a way to offset Trump’s command to Republican-run states to develop redistricting plans that increase the GOP’s congressional representation. But Wittman and Kiggans would still be in trouble if Virginia left their districts intact.

Health care expenses represent a bipartisan financial crisis. A May 2025 tracking poll by KFF showed “three-quarters of uninsured adults say they have skipped or postponed getting the health care they needed due to cost. Having health insurance, however, does not offer ironclad protection as about four in ten adults with insurance (37 percent) still report not getting health care they needed due to cost.”

Those are the stakes as the clock winds down on Congress’ failure to extend the premium tax credits, if only for a few years to work out kinks and help the middle and upper middle classes protect their families. Instead, Republicans just voted down a Democratic proposal for a three-year extension of premium tax credits in the Senate and refused to even bring it up in the House.

Johnson and other Republican leaders who control the Senate and House continue to hurt their own constituents, including essential middle class voters, in the name of partisan purity. Yes, health-care premium tax credits are a result of former Democratic President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Yes, those credits also pair with former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature health-care reform bill, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). At this point, though, the Republican obsession with destroying the ACA has turned self-destructive.

A 2025 Virginia Joint Commission on Health Care report shows why. The state saw reductions in the number of residents without health insurance from 2018 to 2023 due to Medicaid expansion and growth in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Helping the middle and upper middle classes afford health insurance with tax credits makes for a healthier mix of incomes and individuals. Some Republicans contend this amounts to welfare for those who do not need it. Such criticism drips with hypocrisy coming from GOP majorities in the Senate and House, whose members — including Virginia’s entire Republican delegation — just voted for a federal budget without health premium tax credit extensions, but with permanent extensions of tax cuts for the country’s richest individuals and corporations.

Dumping premium credits also ignores the hidden cost of emergency room visits by the uninsured it creates. Those visits often go at least partially unpaid and eventually get passed on in the form of higher insurance premiums to those who do have health coverage. One daunting fact that emerged from Virginia’s 2025 health metrics report is that “the percentage of potentially avoidable emergency department visits in Virginia has steadily increased since 2021.”

As time runs out for extending health insurance premium credits, Republicans have offered little that will effectively replace them. As he did in his first administration, Trump has promoted cheap private health insurance policies that do not cover prior existing conditions, have monetary caps on services, and/or require large deductibles before benefits kick in.

Republicans in Virginia, including Wittman, talk about privatization of health care. Often that includes giving money to individuals for health savings accounts that can be used to buy their own insurance policies or other uses. But the subsidies Republican plans mention — $1,000 per year for some people and $1,500 for others – would not be enough to pay the costs of a couple of trips to the emergency room, much less the bill for a single in-patient surgery.

The Senate and House need to extend the health insurance premium tax credits at least temporarily, if for no other reason than this: They sustain Americans’ physical and financial health in a country where for-profit medical services enrich everyone except the patients.

Dismantling the EPA will leave Americans more exposed to environmental hazards, said Boom.
The EPA canceled the grant, the awardees learned, because the agency classified it as taking part in or promoting environmental justice or diversity, equity and inclusion.
Yet the grant was designed to be geographic and had nothing to do with DEI or environmental justice.
“Science is really foundational to EPA in its ability to achieve its mission, and now it’s at risk,” Orme-Zavaleta said.","Over the past year, environmental experts who have dedicated their lives to public service have watched the partisan, unilateral destruction of the agency they once helped run.

“What’s happening at the EPA right now is not business as usual,” said Marc Boom, senior director of public affairs for the Environmental Protection Network (EPN), a group of former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency employees, at a press briefing on Tuesday. “It’s a serial shutdown of the agency’s ability to protect public health.”

Boom and other former EPA staff working with EPN, founded in 2017 to counter deregulatory actions under the first Trump administration, held a briefing to outline what’s at stake for communities across the country if Congress approves drastic cuts in the agency’s budget as part of next year’s appropriations bill.

The Trump administration proposed slashing the EPA’s $9 billion budget by 55 percent, but Congress is considering less drastic cuts as part of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

As lawmakers consider the agency’s budget in the coming weeks, EPN experts said, they face a stark choice: protect Americans from environmental harms or leave them without a watchdog when pollution or chemical accidents occur.

Though both chambers proposed cuts, EPN praised the Senate’s bipartisan proposal as more responsible.

The Senate would reduce the agency’s budget by about 5 percent, while maintaining critical capacity for science, health and safety. It would halt the administration’s steps to close the agency’s Office of Research and Development (ORD); protect funding to states for clean water and sewage projects, brownfields restoration and other programs; and direct the agency to maintain core functions.

The House’s proposed 23 percent cut would slash enforcement funding, hobble critical scientific research capacity and eliminate more than 60 percent of state funding that communities rely on to keep their drinking water safe, Boom said.

“Passing the Senate approach would send a clear message that the serial shutdown of EPA must be reined in, that congressional intent must be followed, and that Americans still expect guardians on the job protecting their health and safety,” said Boom, who as a senior advisor at EPA helped launch a pilot program to support communities transitioning from fossil fuel economies.

As of Thursday night, however, the bipartisan Senate spending deal appeared in jeopardy, after Colorado Democrats urged Congress to stop the administration’s efforts to close the nation’s premier climate research center and maintain its funding, according to reporting in The Hill.

And the threat to the EPA in the House bill remains.

Dismantling the EPA will leave Americans more exposed to environmental hazards, said Boom. “That’s more exposure to toxic chemicals that raise cancer risk, more dirty air that worsens asthma and lung disease, more threats to reproductive health and child development.”

The attack on the EPA’s capacity started on President Donald Trump’s first day in office, when he revoked several executive orders issued under the previous administration to strengthen environmental, public health and climate regulations, justifying the actions as necessary to “unleash” American energy.

Trump directed the head of every U.S. agency to “suspend, revise or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome.”

Within weeks, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin vowed that the agency under his leadership would “aggressively pursue an agenda powering the Great American Comeback.”

In March, Zeldin pledged to cut 65 percent of the agency’s total spending. Toward that end, he canceled $20 billion in already allocated Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants and nearly $2 billion in grants designed to improve air and water quality and extreme weather resilience. Zeldin called the roughly 400 terminated grants worth $1.7 billion—authorized by Congress to protect clean air and water and facilitate investments in affordable clean energy—“wasteful federal spending.”

The terminated funding included a $21 million climate resilience grant to the heavily industrialized town of Richmond, California. The EPA canceled the grant, the awardees learned, because the agency classified it as taking part in or promoting environmental justice or diversity, equity and inclusion. Yet the grant was designed to be geographic and had nothing to do with DEI or environmental justice. At the same time, Zeldin offered regulated industries a “pass to pollute” that they could garner by simply sending an email to request an exemption from the Clean Air Act.

In July, Zeldin announced an additional $750 million in savings from “reductions in force” staffing cuts as part of its “comprehensive restructuring efforts.” The cuts targeted ORD, the agency’s scientific research arm, and slashed the positions of more than 3,700 employees as part of an explicit campaign to put civil servants “in trauma,” Boom said, referring to a speech Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought made before Trump’s reelection.

“When inspectors, scientists and engineers disappear, corporate interests will go unchallenged, polluters get passes and communities pay the price,” Boom said. “When EPA steps back, pollution moves forward.”

Nonprofits, tribes, local governments and state attorneys general have filed multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration, alleging that it violated federal law and the Constitution by terminating congressionally allocated funds and firing civil servants without cause.

EPA has the resources needed to accomplish the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, fulfill all statutory obligations and make the best-informed decisions based on the gold standard of science, Brigit Hirsch, EPA press secretary, said in a statement.

“EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer resources and will be better able to deliver on its core mission of protecting human health and the environment while powering the ‘Great American Comeback,’” Hirsch said.

Over the past year, political appointees have sidelined experts and, critics contend, the law to roll back limits on toxic air, water and chemical pollution, set about reorganizing and dismantling ORD, which helps the EPA follow its mission to craft regulations using the “best available scientific information,” and forced out thousands of career staff.

The House bill would make these and any other actions taken by the Trump administration the new baseline, said Jeremy Symons, an EPN senior advisor who was a climate policy advisor at EPA. “It puts Congress’ mark on eliminating almost 4,000 positions at EPA and the reorganizations that Zeldin has called for, including eliminating the Office of Research and Development.”

It took several years for the EPA to rebuild staff reductions made during the first Trump administration, said Zealan Hoover, a former senior advisor to EPA Administrator Michael Regan during the Biden administration.

“The major difference this time around is that the administration has so aggressively gone after and pushed out career staff in positions that were historically insulated from political cycles,” said Hoover, who hired several thousand new staff members to implement Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs. The fact that good people are being pushed out and norms broken will harm the ability of a future EPA team to attract the very best scientists and public servants, he said.

The removal of thousands of career staff who have devoted their lives to public service means the incalculable loss of institutional knowledge about the science and law underpinning environmental protections in the country.

“We’re seeing something we’ve never seen before,” said Symons. “This is the first time in EPA’s history of 55 years that we’ve seen a reckless unilateral, partisan attempt to reshape the administration, where Congress has not done its job of passing bipartisan appropriations and holding the administration accountable.”

There’s always been a change in policy focus when a new administration comes in, Symons added. “But there’s a big difference between shifting policy focus and the wholesale demolition that’s happened here that’s been based only on a single elected politician.”

Defunding the EPA at the federal level deprives states of critical funding as well as the expertise and logistical support they need to implement programs that safeguard communities from lead, PFAS, pesticides and other toxic substances that contaminate the air and drinking water.

“Congress has a critical opportunity right now, in the coming weeks, to put a giant stop sign on the attempts to dismantle and modify EPA,” said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who spent 40 years at the EPA and was a top ORD science advisor and administrator.

“Science is really foundational to EPA in its ability to achieve its mission, and now it’s at risk,” Orme-Zavaleta said.

EPA’s current political leadership has defended closing ORD by saying that it will shift lab and research capabilities to its program offices, she said.

But eliminating ORD jeopardizes scientific integrity by eliminating the firewall between independent science and policy, opening the door to political interference and bias to support desired policy outcomes, Orme-Zavaleta said. “Dismantling EPA’s Office of Research and Development would devastate the agency’s ability to protect us from legacy pollution and emerging threats,” she said.

According to the report, emissions of air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act declined sharply between 1990 and 2022.
DEQ’s Division of Air Quality regularly updates the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report.","RALEIGH, NC (WWAY) — North Carolinians are breathing the cleanest air in decades, according to a new report from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

DEQ’s Division of Air Quality released its latest update to the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report, showing a long-term decline in harmful air pollutants such as ozone and fine particulate matter. State officials say emissions reductions are the result of coordinated efforts by state leaders, regulatory agencies, utilities, industry and the public over the past 50 years.

The report shows statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide reached all-time lows in 2022, the most recent year with available data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Even as our population and economy continue to grow, North Carolina’s air quality keeps getting better and better,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “By controlling air pollution, we are giving every North Carolinian a cleaner, healthier future.”

Mike Abraczinskas, director of the Division of Air Quality, credited continued collaboration and environmental policy improvements for the progress.

“Our air quality continues to improve thanks to tireless efforts by our dedicated staff, partners and a wide variety of stakeholders who have come together to implement sound environmental policies,” Abraczinskas said.

According to the report, emissions of air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act declined sharply between 1990 and 2022. During that time, emissions fell 95% for sulfur dioxide, 74% for carbon monoxide, 71% for nitrogen oxides, 48% for fine particulate matter, and 67% for volatile organic compounds.

As emissions have declined, measured concentrations of these pollutants have remained below federal health-based standards statewide for more than a decade. Average sulfur dioxide levels are now 95% below the federal standard, while annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

DEQ says North Carolina’s shift away from coal-fired power generation has been a major factor in the improvements. More electricity now comes from cleaner sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy, along with energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings.

Vehicle emissions have also dropped significantly. From 1990 through 2022, emissions from cars and trucks declined 81% for carbon monoxide, 72% for nitrogen oxides and 85% for volatile organic compounds due to improved engine standards, cleaner fuels and advanced emissions controls. Officials expect further reductions as electric vehicle adoption increases.

High concentrations of air pollutants are linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, haze, acid rain and climate change. DEQ reports that North Carolina has seen reductions across all major classes of harmful pollutants.

The report also highlights several additional findings, including a sharp drop in high-ozone days statewide. From 2015 through 2024, North Carolina recorded just two days classified as “Code Red” or higher for ozone, compared to 83 such days from 2005 through 2014.

Visibility has also improved in national and state parks. At Great Smoky Mountains National Park, average clear-day visibility increased from 54 miles in 1996 to 119 miles in 2023.

Net greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion declined 38% between 2005 and 2020, even as North Carolina’s population and real gross state product grew by 20% and 23%, respectively. Emissions of hazardous and toxic air pollutants also fell more than 82% from 1993 to 2022.

Randy Weber of Texas has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act of 2025, a bill that would establish the first voluntary federal standard for environmental claims on packaging under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and remove what the congressman calls “misleading green labels that confuse consumers and undermine real recycling efforts.”

In a release announcing the legislation, Weber says that across the country, a patchwork of state regulations has resulted in unverified claims like “recyclable,” “compostable” and “reusable” to appear on packaging, “often without any connection to real-world recycling or composting systems.” The congressman claims this confusion has made it harder for consumers to know what can actually be recycled and has weakened legitimate environmental initiatives.

RELATED: Handling the truth

Weber says the PACK Act addresses this problem by promoting science-backed, industry-driven standards for environmental labeling. Under the legislation, companies may only make environmental claims if those claims are scientifically verified and recognized by existing recycling or composting programs, ensuring honesty and transparency without imposing new mandates.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Weber says. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

Recycling industry organizations recently have voiced support for the legislation. For example, the American Institute for Packaging and the Environment (AMERIPEN) says its uniform structure would help businesses provide accurate and transparent information across state lines.

“By reducing consumer confusion and enabling informed choices, the PACK Act will promote proper management of packaging materials at end-of-life, diverting them from landfills and advancing a circular economy,” the Springfield, Massachusetts-based organization says.

AMERIPEN highlights key elements of the bill, including:

Mandatory third-party certification for consumer packaging: The PACK Act requires an accredited third-party certification body to authorize recyclable, compostable and reusable claims on consumer packaging, allowing businesses to utilize a variety of qualified independent parties to certify that packaging meets industry standards and follows the FTC’s “Green Guides” to avoid deceptive claims.

Focus on consumer packaging: The certification programs will address how recyclable, compostable and reusable claims can be made for different types, shapes, sizes and colors of consumer packaging, while nonconsumer packaging will not be subject to the third-party certification requirement.

State preemption: AMERIPEN notes that states will be preempted from enacting or enforcing any legal requirement that is not identical to the requirements under the PACK Act.

Regarding state preemption, AMERIPEN says the approach will ensure that a truly national and consistent framework for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer packaging is achieved to eliminate interstate commerce challenges and, to the extent possible, eliminate consumer confusion and mistrust regarding consumer packaging claims. Additionally, the organization says the legislation would help assure that consumer packaging is “handled correctly.”

Matt Seaholm, President and CEO of the Washington-based Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS), thanked Weber for introducing the bill.

“Plastic packaging is essential to modern life—protecting products, keeping food fresh and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely—yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable and reusable packaging claims,” Seaholm says. “This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.

“As an industry that employs more than 1 million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber’s leadership on this important issue that strengthens U.S. manufacturing and consumer confidence.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/12/19/adobestock_313602407-web.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:54.735491

Founded three years ago, the Energy Integration Lab (EIL) was created under the broader vision of the University as a Lab and brings together expertise from the Schools of Computing and Engineering, Applied Sciences, and Business, Education and Law.

At the heart of the EIL is a unique living energy laboratory that demonstrates how waste from the University and its partners can be transformed into valuable low-carbon energy. Using technologies such as anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, gasification and micro-gas turbines, the Lab converts agricultural, food and industrial wastes into biogas, bio-oil and biochar, which are then used for electricity generation, heat recovery and in agricultural reuse.

This fully circular approach reduces environmental impact while delivering measurable real-world research outcomes, alongside reducing the University’s waste and energy costs.

Reducing environmental impact and energy costs

The Lab maintains close academic collaborations with institutions including the University of York, University College London, the University of Glasgow, the University of Illinois in the USA, ECUST in China, and Kibabii University in Kenya. Beyond academia, the EIL actively engages with industrial and community partners across the UK, USA, China, Kenya and Nigeria.

Professor John Allport, of the School of Computing and Engineering, commented: “Most of the major challenges facing the world today are complex and require a multidisciplinary approach. By drawing on the combined resources from across the University and our collaborators, we are able to find solutions. Some of these affect us directly on campus and can be used to demonstrate the strength of this approach to our students in a way that they can immediately see and comprehend.”

Professor Grant Campbell, of the School of Applied Sciences, commented: “Integration and local contextualisation are key to synergising and exploiting interactions in energy systems. The University gives us a context to showcase implementation and adoption of our own home-grown research, to address our sustainability and financial goals while also demonstrating our commitment to sustainability to our students and regional partners.”

Dr Matthew Snell, of the School of Business, Education and Law, commented: “One of the strengths of this team is its interdisciplinarity. This provides a basis for combining engineering, biochemical, and environmental expertise with insights into the business models, legal frameworks and political contexts which are a feature of the Lab’s very diverse operating environments.”",https://www.hud.ac.uk/media/assets/photo/news/2025/december/Energy-Integration-Lab-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 04:58:30.464105

This week’s commission vote suspends the competitive bidding requirement that’s meant to ensure ratepayers get the best deal available on new power plants.
Electricity from the power plants is dedicated specifically to Meta’s data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could, if needed, sell power to other customers.
Critics of Coussan’s directive include the Louisiana Energy Users Group, a trade coalition of 26 large industrial and petrochemical companies.
Young, the Louisiana Energy Users Group lawyer, asked commissioners to consider more flexible criteria that would allow fast-tracking approvals on a case-by-case basis.","Louisiana regulators have adopted a new rule that suspends certain consumer protections if utility companies need to quickly build power plants for certain industrial developments, including data centers, that require massive amounts of electricity.

The rule change also directs these large-scale customers to pay for half the cost of these new power plants, meaning regular ratepayers could be on the hook for the remaining cost.

In a 4-1 vote Wednesday, the Louisiana Public Service Commission adopted the rule, which creates a streamlined approval process that would drastically reduce the time it takes to greenlight utility projects primarily geared toward data centers. The lone dissenting vote came from Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, who expressed concerns that the proposal could hurt consumers. Lewis has argued that the commission should focus on making energy less expensive for household customers rather than the wealthiest companies in the world, like Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram that is building the world’s largest artificial intelligence data center in Northeast Louisiana.

Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, R-Lafayette, authored the directive in step with Gov. Jeff Landry’s economic development agenda of courting big businesses with state government grants, tax breaks, expedited permitting and industry-friendly regulations.

Coussan said his directive creates a “lightning speed” path for certain power plant proposals brought before the Public Service Commission, echoing the title of Landry’s Sept. 16 executive order to fast-track state agency permitting. In a phone interview Thursday, he said it lets the commission more easily replicate the quick approval process it used for Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a power plant with three natural gas-powered turbines to run the massive data center Meta is building in Richland Parish, which the commission signed off on in August.

This week’s commission vote suspends the competitive bidding requirement that’s meant to ensure ratepayers get the best deal available on new power plants. Generally, competitive bidding requires multiple contractors to submit estimates of what it would cost them to complete the job. The estimates are then published and voted on at an open meeting.

Government entities opt for open bidding on most public works contracts to make the process transparent, avoid conflicts of interest and help ensure qualified contractors are hired.

The new Public Service Commission rules still require approvals at open meetings, though there would be no need to accept multiple bids.

Coussan said the commissioners would still act as a backstop on any proposals that seem overpriced. Any utility using the “lightning speed” avenue must still demonstrate that the proposal is using the “lowest reasonable cost,” he said.

“This could cut our regulatory process down from, say, two years down to eight months,” Coussan said. “This is not a rule in place that can be exploited.”

He referenced the recently truncated timeline in which the commission waived its normal rules in special consideration of Meta’s needs. The commission approved construction of the Entergy power plant for its Northeast Louisiana facility in August despite intense public opposition to the shortened eight-month timeline, considered very fast in the energy regulatory sphere.

The three gas turbines that Entergy is building for Meta’s AI data center will have the capacity to generate 2,200 megawatts of electricity, more than twice what the entire city of New Orleans uses during peak demand hours. Electricity from the power plants is dedicated specifically to Meta’s data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could, if needed, sell power to other customers.

Because of this setup, Meta agreed to pay 100% of the cost for all three turbines that would have otherwise been added to the monthly bills of Entergy Louisiana customers.

Critics of Coussan’s directive include the Louisiana Energy Users Group, a trade coalition of 26 large industrial and petrochemical companies. The group’s attorney, Randy Young, said at Wednesday’s meeting that allowing companies with large power needs to cover only half the cost of new power plants is too lenient and places other ratepayers at risk of having to pay for the remaining cost even if they aren’t using the power plants.

“If you need new generation and you wanna waive the [competitive bidding] requirement, commit to paying the full cost of whatever generation you need — not just half of it,” Young told the commission.

Utility companies will only be able to use the commission’s new lightning approval track for projects with forecasted electricity demand that is beyond the utility’s capacity unless the proposed power plants are built. The rule also requires the utility to have a 15-year contract in place to sell the electricity to its new customer, up from the 10 years Coussan initially proposed. He agreed to the change to assuage some of the concerns of critics who said ratepayers would have to bear the electricity costs if the contract isn’t renewed.

Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said the Public Service Commission has long guaranteed utility companies the right to earn an annual profit on their investments, meaning they make money on new power plants and other additions to their infrastructure by passing along the cost to ratepayers. The previous rules are meant to protect consumers from such impacts, she said.

“Competitive bids are not meant to slow the process,” Burke testified. “They are made to ensure we are all getting the most reasonable deal for every ratepayer dollar.”

Coussan said expediting power plant approvals is meant to spur economic growth and bring new jobs to the people of Louisiana.

The Meta data center is expected to create about 500 direct jobs.

“I’m trying to create jobs and create a positive national perception of Louisiana for business,” Coussan said. “We have cheap and abundant energy sources like natural gas and the workers to deliver it.”

The Public Service Commission can only approve use of the new rule with a written endorsement from the Louisiana Economic Development agency that verifies the project’s power needs. It requires utilities to give the commission a 60 days advanced notice if they intend to pursue expedited approval, and the commission has to take a final vote on the proposal within eight months.

Young, the Louisiana Energy Users Group lawyer, asked commissioners to consider more flexible criteria that would allow fast-tracking approvals on a case-by-case basis. Lewis proposed an alternative that he said would provide a similar level of flexibility to balance expedited approvals with consumer protections, but it was sidelined indefinitely after his colleagues heard and approved Coussan’s.

An eight-month timeline to approve a power plant for a data center stands in contrast to the four-year delay and regulatory hurdles the commission placed on Young’s group when they made a similar request for new energy. Young asked commissioners in June 2024 to let his members buy solar energy from an independent, non-utility company. At that time, the group’s members had been waiting over four years for the commission to vote on the request, which most of the state’s utility companies had opposed.

The commission gave Young its approval but with several big caveats — the group is only allowed to buy a maximum of 500 megawatts and the electricity must be transmitted through a utility’s power lines, letting the utility companies approve or deny the third-party agreements and ensuring they still get a cut of the electricity sales.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/La_meta_render-2048x1024.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:01:16.531727

Japanese regulators certified JERA to import low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives, such as ammonia, which the company plans to produce at the $4 billion Blue Point plant in Ascension Parish beginning in 2029.

Regulators also approved a subsidy for a 15-year period to cover the difference in the price JERA would pay for coal in Japan versus the cost of ammonia imported by the company from the Blue Point project in Louisiana.

JERA, which generates about 30% of Japan’s electricity, plans to import the ammonia to use as fuel at the Hekinan Thermal Power Station, one of the largest thermal plants in the country, which is transitioning from coal-fired power generation.

JERA's goals for the Hekinan Thermal Power Station include a phased transition from coal to ammonia fuel, which is aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In an early test of the technology in 2024, JERA said that with a 20% ammonia fuel mix it was able to produce a stable 1 gigawatt of electricity.

JERA intends to begin using a 20% ammonia fuel mix to produce power at the Hekinan Station beginning in the late 2020s.

Beyond power generation, JERA plans to supply ammonia to a diverse range of users, primarily in the manufacturing and shipping industries. JERA said it has signed agreements to charter four ammonia carriers with Japan-based shipping companies NYK Bulkship (Asia) Pte and MOL.

CF industries, based in Northbrook, Illinois, has a 40% stake in the Blue Point project, while JERA and Mitsui, a Japanese trading company, own 35% and 25%, respectively.

Both JERA and Mitsui are engaged in a variety of energy-related businesses in the U.S. Both have acquired natural gas production companies that are now actively drilling in the Haynesville shale basin in Louisiana and Texas. Additionally, JERA has signed long-term deals with four U.S. suppliers for a total of 9 million tons of liquified natural gas annually.

President Donald Trump and then-Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru said in February the two countries would increase exports of U.S. LNG to Japan ""in a mutually beneficial manner.""

Japanese leaders later pledged investments of $550 billion, which was formalized in meetings in July and September. As part of the deal, Japan committed to stable, long-term purchases of U.S. energy totaling $7 billion per year, incentivizing Japanese firms to own upstream production to ensure stable supplies.

CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui together decided to proceed with the Blue Point project in April 2025.

Louisiana Economic Development provided a performance-based grant of $6 million to CF Industries to reimburse expenditures related to project development. The project is using the agency's workforce training program provided by the state, and the Industrial Tax Exemption Program, which offers property tax breaks.

CF Industries expects the project will qualify for 45Q federal tax credits, which provide $85 per metric ton of CO2 permanently sequestered. With plans to capture and store approximately 2.3 million metric tons annually, the company expects the Blue Point project will generate about $200 million in federal tax credits each year.

Moreover, Tariffs' Impact on Investments demonstrates how trade policy influences energy infrastructure investment decisions.","Energy Sector Capital Allocation Frameworks Drive Infrastructure Investment Pivots

The global energy infrastructure landscape has entered a phase of strategic recalibration, where traditional capital allocation models face unprecedented pressure from competing investment opportunities, regulatory complexity, and evolving market dynamics. Pipeline companies now navigate between two fundamentally different development pathways: domestic pipeline expansion projects that offer predictable returns and shorter development cycles, versus liquefied natural gas export facilities that promise higher revenue potential but demand substantially greater capital commitments and extended project timelines. This strategic tension has reached a critical inflection point, as evidenced by recent high-profile Energy Transfer LNG project suspension and capital reallocation decisions across major energy infrastructure operators.

The fundamental economics of energy infrastructure development have shifted dramatically over the past five years. Pipeline projects typically require capital investments ranging from $500 million to $5 billion per major regional expansion, with development timelines spanning 3-5 years from initial concept to commercial operation. These projects benefit from established regulatory frameworks, proven construction methodologies, and predictable demand patterns through long-term service agreements with anchor customers. Return profiles generally achieve payback periods within 10-15 years, supported by inflation-indexed tariff structures and capacity reservation fees that provide revenue stability regardless of utilization fluctuations.

Conversely, LNG export facility development demands significantly higher capital commitments, often exceeding $10-20 billion for world-scale facilities, with development cycles extending 7-10 years from feasibility studies through commercial operations. These megaprojects face complex regulatory approval processes, technology integration challenges, and exposure to global commodity price volatility that can fundamentally alter project economics during extended development periods. Despite potentially higher absolute returns, the risk-adjusted return profiles often favor pipeline investments when evaluated through modern capital allocation frameworks that emphasize deployment speed, regulatory predictability, and market visibility.

Energy Transfer LNG Project Suspension Reveals Industry-Wide Strategic Realignment

The December 2025 suspension of Energy Transfer LP's Louisiana LNG export project represents more than an isolated corporate decision; it signals a fundamental shift in how major pipeline operators evaluate competing infrastructure investment opportunities. Led by billionaire Kelcy Warren, Energy Transfer's strategic pivot away from the 16.45 million tonnes per annum Louisiana facility toward domestic pipeline expansion reflects broader industry recognition that current market conditions favor domestic infrastructure over export-oriented megaprojects.

The suspension of Energy Transfer's Louisiana project highlights how US Economic Trends directly impact major infrastructure investment decisions. Furthermore, this strategic realignment demonstrates the interconnected nature of domestic energy policy and capital allocation priorities.

Project Component Specification Strategic Significance Planned Capacity 16.45 MTPA Equivalent to ~2.2 bcf/d export capability Location Advantage Louisiana Gulf Coast Direct access to Henry Hub pricing and marine infrastructure Committed Customers Chevron Corp., Shell Plc Major integrated energy companies providing demand certainty Development Status Suspended December 2025 Investment decision deferred indefinitely Alternative Investment Southwest U.S. pipeline expansion Capital reallocation toward domestic infrastructure

The involvement of Chevron Corporation and Shell Plc as committed offtake customers demonstrates that demand-side certainty alone cannot overcome financing and development challenges facing greenfield LNG export projects. These major integrated energy companies possess substantial balance sheet capacity and long-term LNG portfolio requirements, yet their participation proved insufficient to secure project financing at acceptable terms. This outcome reflects broader capital market discipline across the energy sector, where investors increasingly demand shorter payback periods and reduced technology risk exposure.

Engineering partnerships with established contractors including KBR and Technip Energies had positioned the project for technical execution success. KBR brings extensive process engineering expertise in liquefaction train design, while Technip Energies provides specialized subsea engineering capabilities and megaproject delivery experience. However, technical competency cannot address fundamental project economics when capital costs escalate and financing markets restrict availability for long-duration energy infrastructure investments.

The Louisiana facility represented a terminal conversion opportunity, adapting existing gas-import infrastructure constructed before the U.S. shale revolution enabled net LNG export capability. This conversion approach typically reduces capital requirements compared to greenfield facility development, as existing marine terminals, storage capacity, and pipeline connections provide foundation infrastructure. Nevertheless, conversion projects still require substantial investment in liquefaction trains, compression equipment, and regulatory re-permitting for export operations versus historical import functions.

According to Energy Transfer's official announcement, the company stated: ""The suspension of Energy Transfer's LNG project reflects broader difficulties in securing project financing for new export facilities, despite strong global demand fundamentals and committed customer relationships with major energy companies.""

Pipeline Infrastructure Investments Demonstrate Superior Capital Efficiency Metrics

Energy Transfer's simultaneous announcement of expanded Southwest U.S. pipeline development illustrates the comparative advantages driving capital reallocation decisions across the midstream energy sector. Pipeline projects offer fundamentally different risk-return profiles that align more effectively with current capital market preferences and corporate strategic objectives focused on near-term cash flow generation and predictable operational performance.

Capital Efficiency Comparison Analysis:

Investment Category Pipeline Projects LNG Export Facilities Typical Capital Range $500M – $5B per major expansion $10B – $25B+ per facility Development Timeline 3-5 years concept to operation 7-10+ years concept to operation Regulatory Approval Success 60-70% achieve certification 40-50% reach final investment decision Technology Risk Proven, standardised methodologies Complex liquefaction train integration Revenue Predictability 15-20 year service agreements Exposure to global LNG price volatility Expected Payback Period 10-15 years 15-20+ years

The Southwest pipeline expansion addresses specific supply-demand imbalances created by Permian Basin shale gas production growth and increasing industrial consumption across Arizona, Nevada, and California markets. Natural gas production in the Permian Basin has expanded substantially since 2015, creating egress capacity constraints that limit producer access to premium consumption markets. Pipeline utilisation rates in major Southwest corridors currently operate at 75-95% capacity, indicating robust demand fundamentals that support expansion investment decisions.

Pipeline projects benefit from anchor shipper arrangements where major customers contract 50-75% of capacity before construction commencement, providing revenue certainty that facilitates project financing at attractive terms. These long-term service agreements typically include inflation-indexed tariff escalations and minimum volume commitments that protect pipeline operators from demand fluctuations while ensuring customers receive priority capacity access during peak consumption periods.

Industrial demand drivers supporting Southwest pipeline expansion include:

Power generation sector growth: Natural gas-fired electricity generation expansion in Western U.S. markets

Petrochemical industry development: New chemical manufacturing facilities requiring reliable feedstock supply

Industrial heating applications: Manufacturing operations converting from alternative fuels to natural gas

Data centre expansion: Technology sector infrastructure requiring reliable backup power generation capability

The regulatory approval framework for interstate pipeline projects follows established Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) procedures that, while still complex, offer greater predictability than LNG export facility environmental review processes. Pipeline environmental assessments focus primarily on route optimisation, land use impacts, and construction methodologies, whereas LNG facilities undergo comprehensive air quality, marine environment, and cumulative impact evaluations that extend review timelines and increase approval uncertainty.

Global LNG Market Saturation Pressures Challenge New Project Economics

The United States maintains its position as the world's largest LNG exporter, with 2024 exports reaching approximately 13.1 billion cubic feet per day, representing roughly 10-12% of global LNG supply. However, this leadership position faces challenges from expanding global export capacity and increasingly competitive international market dynamics that affect new project development viability across all major LNG-producing regions.

Global LNG export capacity has expanded dramatically, reaching approximately 546 million tonnes per annum in operational facilities worldwide, with additional projects under construction adding 80+ MTPA by 2030. The OPEC Production Outlook influences global energy market dynamics, which in turn affects LNG pricing and project economics. Major LNG exporting nations have accelerated capacity development, including:

Australia: ~90 MTPA operational capacity with additional projects planned

Qatar: ~126 MTPA plus major expansion programmes through 2030

Russia: ~34 MTPA (currently constrained by international sanctions)

Malaysia: ~40 MTPA with targeted Southeast Asian market focus

United States: ~80 MTPA operational across Gulf Coast facilities

This capacity expansion creates competitive pressures on pricing and project economics for new entrants, as global LNG markets demonstrate increasing price sensitivity and buyer preference for diversified supply portfolios. Asian LNG importing nations, particularly Japan, South Korea, and China, have developed sophisticated procurement strategies that leverage multiple suppliers to optimise pricing and reduce supply chain concentration risks.

Financing Environment Challenges

The Energy Transfer LNG project suspension reflects broader capital market constraints affecting energy infrastructure development globally. Despite maintaining access to committed customers and technical expertise, project financing has become significantly more restrictive due to:

Enhanced capital market discipline: Stricter risk-adjusted return requirements for energy infrastructure investments

ESG investment considerations: Environmental, social, and governance criteria affecting institutional investor participation

Rising cost of capital: Higher interest rates and reduced debt availability for long-duration projects

Technology complexity concerns: Investor preference for proven technologies over complex liquefaction processes

Market saturation awareness: Recognition that global LNG capacity growth may exceed demand growth through 2030

Financial institutions have reduced LNG project financing availability by approximately 40-50% compared to 2015-2018 levels, reflecting both market saturation concerns and enhanced risk assessment methodologies. This financing constraint affects even well-positioned projects with strong customer relationships and technical capabilities, as demonstrated by multiple high-profile project deferrals across the global LNG development pipeline.

Strategic Investment Reallocation Impacts Natural Gas Market Dynamics

The reallocation of capital from LNG export development toward domestic pipeline infrastructure creates significant implications for North American natural gas market structure, pricing dynamics, and supply chain optimisation. Energy Transfer's strategic pivot represents part of a broader industry trend that prioritises domestic market development over international export capacity expansion.

Domestic Natural Gas Market Benefits

Pipeline capacity expansion directly supports domestic industrial competitiveness by:

Reducing transportation bottlenecks that constrain gas flow from production regions to consumption centres

Improving price stability through enhanced market connectivity and reduced regional price differentials

Supporting industrial expansion in energy-intensive manufacturing sectors

Enhancing grid reliability for natural gas-fired electricity generation facilities

Enabling energy security through diversified domestic supply chain infrastructure

Regional pipeline capacity constraints have created persistent price differentials between major U.S. natural gas trading hubs. Henry Hub pricing in Louisiana serves as the national benchmark, while regional markets often trade at significant premiums during peak demand periods due to transportation limitations. Southwest pipeline expansion can reduce these differentials by providing alternative transportation routes and increasing market connectivity.

Furthermore, current Oil Price Dynamics demonstrate the interconnected nature of energy markets, where natural gas pricing often correlates with broader hydrocarbon commodity trends. Industrial customers benefit substantially from improved pipeline infrastructure through enhanced supply reliability and more competitive pricing.

Manufacturing operations requiring consistent natural gas supply, including steel production, chemical manufacturing, and cement production, depend on reliable transportation infrastructure to maintain operational continuity and cost competitiveness versus international producers.

Natural Gas Demand Growth Projections

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects domestic natural gas consumption will continue expanding through 2030, driven by:

Power generation sector: Natural gas-fired electricity generation maintaining market share advantages over coal-fired generation

Industrial applications: Manufacturing sector natural gas consumption growth of 2-3% annually

Commercial and residential: Building heating and commercial applications supporting baseline demand

Transportation: Limited but growing compressed natural gas vehicle adoption in specific market segments

The Natural Gas Intel report highlighted that the Energy Transfer LNG project suspension reflects these shifting market priorities. Additionally, US Natural Gas Forecasts suggest continued domestic demand growth supporting pipeline investment strategies.

Pipeline utilisation rates across major U.S. corridors currently range from 75-95%, indicating robust demand fundamentals that support continued infrastructure investment. The Permian-to-Gulf Coast corridor operates at particularly high utilisation due to shale gas production growth and limited egress capacity relative to production volumes.

Critical Performance Indicators Guide Future Infrastructure Investment Decisions

Energy sector stakeholders require comprehensive analytical frameworks to evaluate competing infrastructure investment opportunities as market conditions continue evolving and capital allocation decisions become increasingly complex. The Energy Transfer LNG project suspension provides valuable lessons for assessing similar strategic choices across the midstream energy sector.

Domestic demand growth supporting long-term utilisation and revenue stability

Technology maturity minimising execution risk and operational complexity

Capital efficiency advantages requiring lower absolute investment levels per revenue unit

Regional pipeline expansion priorities will focus on addressing specific supply-demand imbalances, including Permian Basin egress capacity, Northeast market access, and Southeast industrial demand growth. These targeted investments offer superior risk-adjusted returns compared to large-scale export infrastructure development.

LNG Export Facility Development Pipeline

New LNG export project development faces continued challenges despite strong global demand fundamentals:

Capital market restrictions limiting financing availability for megaproject development

Environmental review complexity extending regulatory approval timelines beyond historical norms

Global competition intensification as international suppliers expand export capacity

Technology cost escalation affecting project economics and return profiles

Market saturation risks as global capacity growth potentially exceeds demand expansion

Successful LNG projects will likely require enhanced financial structures, including government policy support, strategic customer equity participation, or modular development approaches that reduce capital intensity and development risk.

Policy and Regulatory Evolution

Federal energy policy will continue influencing infrastructure development priorities through:

Environmental review modernisation potentially streamlining approval processes for domestic infrastructure

Energy security considerations supporting domestic pipeline network resilience and capacity expansion

International trade policy affecting LNG export market access and competitive positioning

Climate policy integration influencing long-term natural gas infrastructure investment strategies

The intersection of energy security, economic competitiveness, and environmental objectives will shape regulatory frameworks that affect both pipeline and LNG facility development timelines and approval criteria. Moreover, Tariffs' Impact on Investments demonstrates how trade policy influences energy infrastructure investment decisions.

Investment Market Evolution

Capital allocation trends across the energy infrastructure sector indicate continued preference for:

Shorter payback periods through pipeline and regional infrastructure investments

Predictable cash flow generation via established customer relationships and proven technologies

Domestic market focus reducing exposure to international commodity price volatility and geopolitical risks

Modular expansion capability enabling phased capital deployment and risk management

Operational efficiency optimisation through technology integration and asset portfolio synergies

The Energy Transfer LNG project suspension demonstrates that even well-positioned projects with strong customer commitments and technical capabilities face substantial challenges in current market conditions. This outcome provides valuable guidance for industry stakeholders evaluating similar strategic decisions and capital allocation priorities in the evolving energy infrastructure landscape.

The project introduces the first publicly accessible Level 3 fast-charging hubs near the downtown metro areas of both cities. The expansion supports fleet electrification and improves public access to high-speed charging.

EV Fast-Charging Hubs Address Urban Gaps

The new PowerUp Point stations allow drivers to charge vehicles to 80% in about 20 minutes. This reduces charging time from hours to minutes. The Kansas City site includes 12 high-power charging ports. The Pittsburgh site includes six ports.

Before the project, Kansas City had only a few public fast chargers. None operated within five miles of downtown. Pittsburgh faced similar limitations. The EV fast-charging hubs now fill a critical infrastructure gap in both markets.

“Our goal is to make EV charging as easy and reliable as filling up a gas tank,” said Josh Green, CEO of Inspiration Mobility Group. “By adding commercial-grade Level 3 fast-charging solutions in both cities, we’re helping accelerate the shift to electric transportation and ensuring fleets and local drivers can charge quickly, reliably, and conveniently.”

Public Access and Fleet Support

Inspiration owns and manages the charging depots. Each site offers 24/7 public access. The hubs support taxi fleets, rideshare drivers, delivery vehicles, local businesses, and everyday EV owners.

“As the nation’s largest taxi fleet operator, we know how critical reliable charging is to keeping drivers on the road and passengers served,” said Bill George, CEO of zTrip. “Partnering with Inspiration not only supports our own EV transition but also strengthens the entire EV community in both cities.”

Platform Integration Enhances Charging Experience

To support public access, Inspiration partnered with Presto. The platform helps drivers locate chargers, initiate charging, and complete payment. The system is designed to scale as demand increases.

“The PowerUp Points are exactly what Presto was built for: shared-use infrastructure that grows with demand and delivers consistent, fast-charging access,” said Ashwin Dias, CEO of Presto.

Downtown Locations and Future Expansion

The Kansas City PowerUp Point operates in the downtown Paseo West district. The Pittsburgh site is located in the historic Manchester neighborhood. Each hub operates year-round with 180-kilowatt-hour chargers. The chargers support CCS connectors and NACS with an adapter.

The public opening marks the next phase of the Inspiration and zTrip partnership. The companies launched their first charging depot for zTrip fleet drivers in November 2024.

The bill (S4100/A5264) intends to speed up the approval process for residential solar and battery systems through use of an automated permitting platform.
A recent report by Permit Powerfinds that by cutting the red tape in rooftop solar permitting, almost 20 million more families would install solar by 2040.
Reducing bureaucratic barriers, particularly rooftop solar permitting, inspection and interconnection processes, will reduce installation costs in many areas in the United States, the report finds.
“No one should be locked out of the clean energy transition, but an unwieldy permitting process can do just that.","The New Jersey State Senate passed revised “smart solar” permitting legislation and the bill now goes to Governor Murphy for his signature.

The Regional Plan Association released a report earlier this year that found that New Jersey has the third-slowest permitting timelines for residential solar projects in the country. The bill (S4100/A5264) intends to speed up the approval process for residential solar and battery systems through use of an automated permitting platform.

The State Assembly previously passed in a votes of 75-0-1 vote earlier this month. Permit Power told pv magazine USA that the bill, which had been conditionally vetoed by Gov. Murphy last month and now passed by the legislature represents mutually agreed upon language and is expected to be signed by the governor.

According to Permit Power, the most substantive change to the Assembly bill was to extend the compliance deadlines in the bill by an additional 6 months.

Other changes were mostly technical and semantic, according to Permit Power. They include directing the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) to issue an RFP for the development of the statewide smart permitting platform, and giving the board of public utilities a consultative role in the RFP process. The bill also now explicitly limits the use of the platform and preparation of materials submitted through the platform to licensed professionals including contractors, engineers, architects.

Once signed into law, the DCA will be required to make an online, automated permitting platform for rooftop solar and battery installs available statewide within a year.

The bill also allows local communities to opt out of using the DCA platform as long as they implement a comparable alternative. These jurisdictions must submit an annual report to the DCA that provides information on the number of permit applications submitted through their automated platform and shows documentation that their platform meets the needed requirements.

Increasing solar installations will save New Jersey ratepayers more than $87 million by 2030 and add more than 560 clean energy jobs, according to a letter signed by 33 organizations in support of the bill that passed in the New Jersey assembly in June.

“In this year of rising utility bills, this is a moment for solutions to provide more clean energy to our electric grid and provide more savings for ratepayers. Smart solar permitting can bring permitting into the 21st century, reduce costs and burdens on towns and cities and get more clean energy onto the electric grid and save ratepayers money,” said State Sen. John McKeon (D-27), the Senate prime sponsor of the legislation.

A recent report by Permit Powerfinds that by cutting the red tape in rooftop solar permitting, almost 20 million more families would install solar by 2040. Reducing bureaucratic barriers, particularly rooftop solar permitting, inspection and interconnection processes, will reduce installation costs in many areas in the United States, the report finds.

Permitting inefficiencies also increase costs for consumers, according to the Greenhouse Institute, adding $3,800 to $4,500 to the cost of a typical rooftop solar system in New Jersey. Nearly one out of five residential solar projects are cancelled before installations, the report finds, with installers citing permitting barriers as the number one reason for the cancellations.

“With energy bills on the rise, one of the most direct ways we can protect communities is by making it easier, faster and more affordable to generate clean energy at home,” said Elowyn Corby, Mid-Atlantic Regional Director for Vote Solar Action Fund. “No one should be locked out of the clean energy transition, but an unwieldy permitting process can do just that. Along with the other members of the statewide NJ Shines Coalition, we’re excited for this bill to accelerate progress toward a resilient and equitable New Jersey that works for everyone.”

It’s the end of the year, and so one should be compiling ten-best lists.

And I turned 65 last week, having spent almost my entire adult life in the climate fight, so it’s one of those moments when I wish I could look back with a certain amount of satisfaction.

But since I owe you honesty, not exuberance, just at the moment I can’t provide much celebration. I was hopeful this edition of The Crucial Years might be about a big victory—on Wednesday the board that controls New York City’s pension funds was considering whether or not to pull tens of billions from Blackrock because of the investment giant’s climate waffling, which would have been a massive display of courage. Sadly, the city comptroller Brad Lander hadn’t gotten the measure on the agenda before the final meeting of his term, and he seems to have run out of time and political juice—the idea was tabled.

And so we’re left staring at a pile of recent defeats, at least in this country (which is an important qualification). I’ll try to end in a more hopeful place, but I fear you’re going to have to work through my angst with me for a few minutes.

The most traumatic item is the Trump administration’s decision to shut down the National Center for Atmospheric Research, born like me in 1960. It was a product of that era’s faith in science, a faith that paid off spectacularly. Take weather forecasting. As Nature reported today

Work at NCAR played a key part in the rise of modern weather and climate forecasting. For instance, the lab pioneered the modern dropwindsonde, a weather instrument that can be released from an aircraft to measure conditions as it plummets through a storm. The technology reshaped the scientific understanding of hurricanes, says James Franklin, an atmospheric scientist and former branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.

But its most historically significant work has been in understanding the dimensions of the ongoing climate crisis. Nature again

On the global scale, NCAR is known for its climate-modelling work, including the world-leading models that underpin international assessments such as those from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Hundreds of scientists pass through NCAR’s doors each year to collaborate with its researchers. More than 800 people are employed at NCAR, most of whom work at the centre’s three campuses in Boulder, including the iconic Mesa Lab that sits at the base of jagged mountain peaks and was designed by architect I. M. Pei.

There’s no question about why the administration is doing what it’s doing. Project 2025 enforcer Russell Vought explained it quite succinctly—NCAR must go because it is “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country.” This is stupid—it’s like closing the fire department because it’s a source of “fire alarmism”—but it’s by now an entirely recognizable form of stupid. And it’s also sly: it’s like spraypainting over the surveillance cameras so you can rob the bank without anyone watching. But of course nothing changes with the underlying physics. Indeed yesterday, as the announcement came down, NCAR was closed for the day because

the local electrical company planned to cut electricity preemptively to reduce wildfire risk as fierce winds were forecast around Boulder. In 2021, a wildfire ignited just kilometres from NCAR; fuelled by powerful winds, it ripped through suburban homes, killing two people. Many researchers say this is a new normal of increased fire risk in an era of climate change — a topic of study at NCAR.

I am glad people are rallying to fight—there was an emergency press conference today at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, where many of the world’s earth scientists are gathered. Third Act Colorado is working with Indivisible on a weekend rally. This is the scientific equivalent of tearing down the East Wing of the White House, and given the moment a lot more significant.

But I’m saddened to see how little our representatives in DC seem to really care, even the Democratic ones. Sixteen Democratic Senators voted today to confirm Trump (and Elon Musk’s) nominee to head NASA, even though, as Brad Johnson pointed out in his Hill Heat newsletter, the administration is trying to slash science research at the agency in half. The new head, Jared Isaacman, is clearly on board. As he wrote this spring, “Take NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine.” But of course the administration is wrecking that too—they cut off the funding for the gold standard climate research program at Princeton on the grounds that it was “contributing to a phenomenon known as ‘climate anxiety,’ which has increased significantly among America’s youth.”

Too many Democratic leaders are feeling comfortable waving off climate concerns, because of a feeling that it might be a political problem for them. That was exemplified this morning in the New York Times when center-right pundit Matt Yglesias issued a strident call for liberals to “support America’s oil and gas industry.” That he did it hours after that oil and gas industry won its fight to shutter climate research was probably coincidental, but the piece was a woebegone recycling of decades-old bad-faith arguments from a person who has insisted repeatedly that climate change is not an existential risk. Yglesias wants us to follow Obama-era ‘all of the above’ energy policies even though they date from fifteen years ago, when clean energy was more expensive than dirty, and long before we had the batteries that could make solar and wind fully useful. It’s no longer a good argument, but he has not changed his tune one iota—he keeps invoking Obama, as if what was passable policy in 2008 still made sense.

The centerpiece of his argument is that we should support the gas industry because at least it produces less carbon than coal.

It is much cleaner than coal, consumption of which is still high and rising globally. Increased gas production, by displacing coal, has been the single largest driver of American emissions reductions over time. To the extent that foreign countries can be persuaded to rely on American gas exports rather than coal to fill the gaps left by the ongoing build-out of intermittent wind and solar that’s a climate win.

By now anyone following this debate knows that this is a mendacious point. That’s because the switch to gas has reduced American carbon emissions at the cost of increasing American methane emissions. Those who, like Yglesias, followed last year’s debate over pausing permitting for LNG export terminals know that the crucial point was the science showing that in fact American LNG exports were worse than coal. The job is to get others to switch to solar, not coal—and that’s happening everywhere except the U.S., whose appetite for the stuff is apparently the thing still driving up global consumption even as demand drops in China and India.

Having written many many opeds for the Times, I know that they fact-check things like the methane numbers; this should not have eluded them, but in fairness it’s eluded Democrats for decades, because gas has been such a convenient out for those unwilling to stand up to Big Oil. If I sound sore here, it’s because I’ve tried and failed to get this basic point of physics across; it’s just technical enough that senators often forget it, but ostensibly serious people like Yglesias should at least grapple with it.

All of this comes on the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate talks—and tenth anniversary of the Congress and (Democratic) president approving the resumption of U.S. oil exports. I celebrated my 55th in Paris, and I remember being hunched over a laptop at a cafe writing what I think may have been the only oped opposing that resumption. As I said at the time

It’s especially galling that Senate leaders -- Republicans and Democrats -- are apparently talking about trading this gift to Exxon and its ilk for tax breaks for wind and solar providers. It’s hard to imagine a better illustration of politicians who simply don’t understand the physics of climate change. We don’t need more of all kinds of energy -- we need more of the clean stuff and way, way less of the dirty. Physics doesn’t do backroom deals.

And indeed the Senators who said it was no big deal were wrong. America is, as Tony Dutzik pointed out this week, now the biggest oil exporter on earth. He lays out the case nicely

“There is currently little if any incentive for U.S. oil producers to export crude oil even if the ban is lifted,” wrote Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, for example, in December 2015.

A decade later, those breezy assessments have proven to be wildly off-base. “The United States produces more crude oil than any country, ever,” reads a 2024 headline from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), one of the agencies that got it wrong. Not only did lifting the crude export ban lead to a surge in oil production, but it also dramatically reshaped the global energy system, U.S. politics and greenhouse gas emissions.

So, anyway, feeling a little sad today. But I do think this is a low point, because I think around the rest of the world, where Trump (and pundits like Yglesias) have marginally less sway, things are continuing to break the right way. In fact, earlier today the premier journal Science picked its scientific “Breakthrough of the Year” and it turned out to be not some fascinating if arcane new discovery, but instead the prosaic but powerful spread of renewable energy around the planet.

This year, renewables surpassed coal as a source of electricity worldwide, and solar and wind energy grew fast enough to cover the entire increase in global electricity use from January to June, according to energy think tank Ember. In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared at the United Nations that his country will cut its carbon emissions by as much as 10% in a decade, not by using less energy, but by doubling down on wind and solar. And solar panel imports in Africa and South Asia have soared, as people in those regions realized rooftop solar can cheaply power lights, cellphones, and fans. To many, the continued growth of renewables now seems unstoppable—a prospect that has led Science to name the renewable energy surge its 2025 Breakthrough of the Year.

The tsunami of tech spilling from China’s factories has changed the country’s energy landscape—and its physical one, too. For decades China’s development was synonymous with coal, which produced choking air pollution and massive carbon emissions, still greater than those of all other developed nations combined. Now, solar panels carpet deserts and the high, sunstruck plateau of Tibet, and wind turbines up to 300 meters tall guard coastlines and hilltops (see photo essay, below). China’s solar power generation grew more than 20-fold over the past decade, and its solar and wind farms now have enough capacity to power the entire United States.

China’s burgeoning exports of green tech are transforming the rest of the world, too. Europe is a longtime customer, but countries in the Global South are also rushing to buy China’s solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines, spurred by market forces and a desire for energy independence. In Pakistan, for example, imports of Chinese solar panels grew fivefold from 2022 to ’24 as the Ukraine war pushed up natural gas prices and the cost of grid power. “For people who were asking, ‘How am I going to keep the lights on in my home,’ it was a very obvious choice,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. In South Africa, old and unreliable coal plants drove a similar dynamic. Ethiopia has embraced solar and wind amid worries that hydropower, the country’s mainstay, will decline as droughts become more frequent.

That’s the fight as we head into 2026. Trump and Big Oil have had the run of things this year, but their idiocy is pushing up against limits: among other things, it turns out that permitting every data center imaginable while cutting off the supply of cheap sun and wind is sending energy prices through the roof, which may be a real issue as midterms loom.

I’m not retiring—I’m here for the fight, and you too I hope

+Sea level rise seems to be accelerating. A new study of dozens of tide gauges around the U.S. shows, as Brady Dennis puts it, that a pretend study carried out by climate skeptics for the Department of Energy earlier this year, “stands in contrast” to reality.

Chris Piecuch, a sea-level scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said he undertook his analysis in response to that Energy Department report, which he and others argue uses cherry-picked data to conclude that “U.S. tide gauge measurements reveal no obvious acceleration beyond the historical average rate of sea level rise.”

Piecuch said that while the rate of rising seas varies from place to place, the full range of available data leads to “a dramatically different conclusion” about what is actually unfolding along the nation’s coastlines.

“If you want to be thorough, you take all the data we have. When you do that, you find pretty unambiguous evidence of sea-level rise over the past century” in much of the country, said Piecuch, the author of the study published Wednesday in the journal AGU Advances.

“It’s not politics. That’s what the data say.”

Meanwhile, Arctic sea ice is at a record low level for the date

and a new study shows what a miserable year it’s been up north, with the highest temperatures ever recorded. As Oliver Millman puts it

From October 2024 to September 2025, temperatures across the entire Arctic region were the hottest in 125 years of modern record keeping, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said, with the last 10 years being the 10 warmest on record in the Arctic.

The Arctic is heating up as much as four times as quickly as the global average, due to the burning of fossil fuels, and this extra heat is warping the world’s refrigerator – a region that acts as a key climate regulator for the rest of the planet.

The maximum extent of sea ice in 2025 was the lowest in the 47-year satellite record, Noaa reported on in its annual Arctic report card. This is the latest landmark in a longer trend, with the region’s oldest, thickest ice declining by more than 95% since the 1980s as the Arctic becomes hotter and rainier.

This year was a record for precipitation in the Arctic. Much of this is not settling as snow – the June snow cover extent over the Arctic today is half of what it was six decades ago.

+The Trump campaign against electric vehicles is causing a $19.5 billion dollar writedown at Ford, which will retool its assembly lines to make more hybrid vehicles and fewer true EVs.

But some industry experts said Ford’s strategy could make it vulnerable in the future if car buyers, including in the United States, became more willing to use electric vehicles.

“Dropping the Lightning might make Ford more China-proof until the day Chinese companies understand American pickup buyers the way Japanese car companies learned to understand American sedan and then S.U.V. buyers,” Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, said in an email. “There are no trade secrets to understanding American vehicle buyers.”

Meanwhile, Uber is pulling back its incentives for EV use

After long advocating for stronger government policies to speed up EV adoption, Uber did a U-turn this spring and stumped for President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” This included Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi appearing in a White House promotional video for the legislation, which the League of Conservation Voters called “the most anti-environmental bill of all time.” The law slashed clean-energy incentives and is expected to slow EV adoption in the US by about 40% compared to previous projections.

Underscoring the stupidity of all this: new numbers from China on the explosive growth in electric trucks there.

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle’s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

“When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,” Doleman said.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

Beyond trucks, the rest of transit. Here’s a fascinating essay from Andrew Beebe on the coming frontiers of electrification:

Another of our companies, Pyka, is flying fully electric aircraft to spray crops and take human pilots out of some of agriculture’s dirtiest and most dangerous work. And Lightship is bringing that same leap forward to RVs, a category once thought incompatible with electrification.

And these are just the visible edge. Electrification is reaching deep into the infrastructure of the modern world, in warehouses, ports, farms, delivery fleets, even the shipping lanes between continents. As more sectors make the switch, the compounding benefits for cost, emissions, and resilience are accelerating.

The best example of the dramatic progress on electrification might come from electric ships. A young company called Fleet Zero is demonstrating how to make the transition. The company was founded by former veteran merchant mariners who realized the current shipping industry is not just dirty with pollution, but dangerous and inefficient for the crews. They saw that the future of shipping wasn’t in slow, incremental decarbonization with costly, volatile fuels like ammonia or methanol. The future is full electrification, from engine room to bridge.

Fleet Zero is following the proven short-haul strategy, starting with nearshore, back-and-forth routes—also known as “drayage” of the sea—to build a multi-billion dollar business before scaling to trans-oceanic vessels. The long-term vision is a world where there are no oil slicks, no diesel off-gas, and no need for twelve people to live and breathe in a poorly ventilated engine room.

+Great video from PBS on the rapid spread of plug-in or balcony solar. We started tracking this on this newsletter about a year ago, and I’d say it’s now safe to say it’s getting pretty close to the mainstream.

+Rapid falls in the price of storage batteries are essentially turning solar power into 24 hour supply—the numbers, says Michelle Lewis, are truly remarkable

As Ember global electricity analyst Kostantsa Rangelova put it, after a 40% drop in battery equipment costs in 2024, the industry is now on track for another major fall in 2025. The economics of battery storage, she said, are “unrecognizable,” and the industry is still adjusting to this new reality.

“Solar is no longer just cheap daytime electricity; now it’s anytime dispatchable electricity. This is a game-changer for countries with fast-growing demand and strong solar resources,” Rangelova added.

+I’m a longtime admirer of Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, whose new exhibition, Presence, manages to capture a roiling sun in ways that make audiences gasp. A fine profile in the Guardian includes him taling about how art can work to change our perceptions:

He rejects the idea that nature created inside a gallery is fundamentally different to nature outside: “There is no outside and inside. There is only the world. The gallery is inside of what is outside. You don’t step into a gallery to disappear into the void. You go in to see more clearly; to see things which outside are contaminated and politicised and weaponised.”

He despairs for the world, but Eliasson ultimately calls himself a “prisoner of hope” – a phrase used by the late archbishop Desmond Tutu to describe his unwavering faith that good ultimately prevails. He speaks about Indigenous philosophies that view nature as kin, and the movement to grant legal “personhood” rights to natural features such as mountains, rivers and forests. He is heartened by these shifts away from the anthropocentric worldview: “It’s comforting to know people have the capacity to change how they see things.”

+Sharon Lerner at ProPublica has an important report on the EPA’s new project: doubling the amount of formaldehyde we get to breathe. If that sounds bad, well, it is.

Last week, in a highly unusual move, the Environmental Protection Agency embraced that approach in announcing that it is revising an assessment of the health dangers posed by formaldehyde, a widespread pollutant that causes far more cancer than any other chemical in the air. Working on that effort were two of those former industry insiders, who are now top EPA officials.

The proposed revisions to the assessment, released Wednesday, nearly double the amount of formaldehyde considered safe to inhale compared with the version that was finalized in the last weeks of the Biden administration. Even that older assessment significantly underestimated the dangers posed by formaldehyde, a ProPublica investigation published last year found.

Under previous Republican and Democratic administrations, EPA scientists were instructed to assume that chemicals that cause cancer by damaging DNA — the largest group of carcinogens, which includes formaldehyde — pose a “linear” risk, meaning that even small exposures can be dangerous. The agency adopted the approach almost 40 years ago to protect against the multitude of low-level cancer threats the public faces daily. But the industry’s favored method assumes that certain carcinogens pose no risk at lower levels and that the danger should only be considered once exposure reaches a certain threshold.

The Trump administration has already criticized the use of the linear model for calculating the risk of cancer from radiation and could scrap its use in examining other chemicals.

+Congestion pricing in New York City has proven to be…kind of miraculous. New data from the first six months of the project finds

The first quasi-experimental evidence that New York City’s cordon-based congestion pricing policy produced rapid and substantial air-quality improvements. Within just six months of implementation, daily maximum PM 2.5 in the CRZ declined by 22%, controlling for background concentrations, meteorology, and neighborhood demographics. This magnitude exceeds prior evidence from Stockholm, where congestion pricing reduced air pollution by 5–15% between 2006 and 20105, andLondon’s Ultra Low Emission Zone, which achieved about a 7% decline in PM 2.5 citywide between 2019 and 202210 .

The comparatively larger effects in New York likely reflect both the intensity of travel demand and the greater modal flexibility of its commuters, supported by an extensive transit system and multi-modal system.Importantly, the results show that air-quality improvements werenot confined to the tolled zone. We find no evidence of emissions displacement to neighboring areas; instead, the analysis reveals net reductions across the broader metropolitan region. These findings suggest that congestion pricing acts as a system-wide behavioral intervention rather than a geographically bounded one.

+Clare Fieseler has an almost-poignant and really fascinating account of the guy who’s spent the last years effectively spewing misinformation about offshore wind in an effort to kill the industry in America.

Nowadays, David Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.

“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”

All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas — which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal — was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.

+Carbon credits have been a grave disappointment bordering on a general scam—but there’s one interesting emerging case where they might work? Anton Delgado, writing in the Washington Post, describes their use in the Philippines to

help pay for phasing out coal use by creating value out of the emissions that would prevent. The funds would then pay to replace fossil fuel equipment with clean energy gear.

Proponents say transition credits could unlock a windfall of investment for the power hungry Asia-Pacific region and speed up Southeast Asia’s transition to renewable energy.

The Rockefeller Foundation designed the transition credits concept to help finance early retirement of coal plants by paying for replacing fossil fuel gear with renewable energy equipment used to keep generating power at the same sites.

Patrick McCully, an energy transition analyst for Reclaim Finance, wrote in a recent report that transition credits would likely repeat failures of the carbon market,” asserting the credits are a “dead end” because the industry hasn’t addressed false promises, inaccurate carbon calculations and other issues.

Environmental groups are yet again challenging Louisiana regulators in their decision to reissue a previously suspended permit for a liquified natural gas export facility in Cameron Parish.

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th judicial district against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --Favor, the only on-demand delivery app by and for Texans, released its 2025 How Texas Orders In report today, highlighting the trends, tastes and memorable orders that defined delivery across the Lone Star State this year. From top dishes, dips and drinks to the most heartwarming and hilarious Delivery Notes, the 2025 report shares how Texans relied on delivery to make the most of every moment this year.

How Texas Orders In:

Tacos and queso held onto their top spots as Texans' most-ordered dish and dip, while coffee overtook Dr Pepper to become the most ordered drink of 2025.

Preference data revealed Texans chose corn tortilla tacos over flour tortilla tacos, sweet tea over unsweet tea, white wine over red wine, and bone-in wings over boneless wings.

Tomatoes, avocados, limes and jalapeños topped H-E-B Now orders – a clear sign Texans were making plenty of guacamole in 2025.

With Favor available in more than 400 Texas cities, the report also spotlights hyper-local moments across the state:

Austin saw Thai orders double during the White Lotus season finale on April 6.

Dallas–Fort Worth led the state in edamame orders.

Houston logged the most ""thank you"" and ""howdy"" messages in Delivery Notes for delivery drivers.

San Antonio had the most requests to add jalapeños.

Rio Grande Valley ordered 14 times more tamales than the average of other Texas cities.

Lubbock experienced a spike in tortilla orders during college football season – but orders dipped after the ban on tossing tortillas on the field.

One of the report's most beloved sections focuses on Delivery Notes, offering a glimpse into how Texans communicate with Runners (that's what Favor delivery drivers are called). ""Don't knock"" remained the most common note left for Runners, but ""don't judge"" notes increased this year, including messages like ""Don't judge the dead plants on my porch"" and ""Don't judge me by how close I live to the store!"".

Delivery Notes also captured how Texans relied on Favor in unexpected moments, from extra hair dye for a San Antonian mid-color to a Coke Zero rescue for an Austinite when a restaurant's soda machine went down.

The report shows that investments, which had tripled from 2021 to 2024, peaking at $4.7 billion in Q3 2024, have now stagnated, with energy and industry expenditures plummeting from $1.27 billion in Q3 2024 to just $445 million by Q3 2025.

The report also covers how Trump administration led changes to funding have impacted local projects, including the industrial efficiency projects at the Cleveland-Cliffs Corporation in Middletown, OH, workforce development programming led by Landforce in Pittsburgh, PA, long term delays to a coal to solar project in Nicholas County, WV, and impacts to the development of a battery manufacturing facility led by Sparkz Inc. in cooperation with the United Mine Workers of America in Taylor County, WV.

“The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act brought unprecedented investment and job creation to communities across our region,” said Diana Polson, report co-author. “We documented $9.85 billion in energy and industry investments, $18.8 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and $22.3 billion in retail purchases of clean technologies since 2022. These were transforming our communities, creating good-paying jobs that don’t require college degrees. Now we’re watching those opportunities slip away as federal funding flatlines.”

Rike Rothenstein, report co-author, added: “The data tells a stark story. Clean energy manufacturing grew from nearly nothing in 2018 to substantial investments by 2023, with 72% going to battery manufacturing and 19% to zero-emissions vehicles. But the momentum has stopped. Federal clean energy investments waned dramatically as President Trump took office for his second term, and the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to dismantle remaining programs entirely. From a canceled furnace upgrade at Cleveland-Cliffs’ steel plant in Middletown, Ohio, to a stalled solar project on former mine land in Nicholas County, WV, our case studies show how these cuts impact our communities.”

“What’s particularly devastating is that the majority of threatened jobs are in construction and manufacturing, exactly the kind of blue-collar work our communities need,” said Dana Kuhnline, report co-author. “These investments were targeting places like Appalachia that have been left behind. The chaotic efforts to dismantle them will have particularly devastating impacts here, raising residential energy prices, sabotaging job creation, and ceding America’s leadership in clean energy to foreign competitors.”

Key findings from the report include:

Clean energy investments dropped from a peak of $4.7 billion in Q3 2024 to $3.8 billion in Q1 2025, with continued flatlining through Q3 2025

Energy and industry expenditures plummeted 65% from their peak, from $1.27 billion to $445 million

67% of projected clean energy jobs in the region (over 61,000 jobs) are now at risk

Federal funding decreased significantly as the Trump administration took office, reversing gains from historic climate legislation

National data from the Federal Reserve corroborates regional trends, showing private construction spending in manufacturing plateaued at $240 billion in mid-2024 after tripling from 2021

The analysis predicts that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will raise residential energy prices, sabotage job creation, and cede America’s leadership in clean energy and manufacturing to foreign competitors, with Appalachian communities bearing the brunt of these impacts.

“In less than a year, we have seen the historic growth of the clean energy and manufacturing sectors drop to a flat line,” the report concludes. “Our region was set to create 92,282 jobs because of clean energy investments. Now those opportunities are vanishing before our eyes.”",https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RA-logo-white-background.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:27.137421

Unlike previous years, a consensus on the state budget remained elusive.
Throughout July and August, the legislature failed to meet its self-imposed deadlines for the state budget.
While the Board did not approve the language of the proposal, the proposal is still able to move forward.
Senators debated the “Real Jobs for Michigan” job creation package, which is similar to the 2019 “Good Jobs for Michigan” initiative.","The year began with a significant victory for Michigan’s innovation economy. In January, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a bipartisan package that created a Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit and the Michigan Innovation Fund. The Detroit Regional Chamber has long advocated for these tools to retain high-tech firms and align Michigan with competitor states. The tiered credit system, offering specific benefits for both small and large employers, signaled a strong commitment to fostering a knowledge-based economy.

However, there were immediate headwinds in February as the amended Earned Sick Time Act (ESTA) and new minimum wage mandates took effect. The implementation of these policies created administrative and financial hurdles for small businesses, particularly regarding the specific accrual mandates and lack of exemptions for smaller enterprises. The Chamber successfully negotiated amendments to ESTA that made the sick time mandates flexible for small businesses and compatible with generous employer policies.

By March, the focus shifted to road funding, with House Republicans taking the lead. While the package of bills was a solution to the issues the state’s roads faced, and the Chamber was supportive of it, the Chamber did testify in opposition to one component of the bill that would have eliminated Michigan Economic Growth Authority (MEGA) tax credits.

In April, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) achieved accreditation from the International Economic Development Council, a mark of excellence that bolsters the state’s reputation among site selectors.

The Chamber’s annual Mackinac Policy Conference, held in late May, was the premier forum where state leaders and business executives discussed the “Make It in Michigan” strategy, focusing on talent retention and housing. The Chamber utilized this platform to champion the “Make MI Home” talent attraction initiative, securing widespread support for policies that not only create jobs but ensure Michigan has the workforce to fill them.

As the statutory budget deadline approached in July, tensions in Lansing began to rise. Unlike previous years, a consensus on the state budget remained elusive. The Chamber consistently urged lawmakers to prioritize fiscal prudence and avoid using one-time funds for ongoing expenses, a principle that became a central point of contention as negotiations stalled.

The summer months were dominated by the ripple effects of federal policy and the ongoing budget stalemate. The passage of federal tax changes, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, created a divergence between state and federal tax codes.

Throughout July and August, the legislature failed to meet its self-imposed deadlines for the state budget. The delay created uncertainty for schools, local governments, and businesses as they prepared for the upcoming fiscal year. The Chamber publicly expressed concern regarding the lack of a finalized spending plan, emphasizing that predictability and consistency are cornerstones of a strong business environment.

Lastly, the Michigan Board of Canvassers failed to approve ballot language for a graduated income tax proposal, known as “Invest in MI Kids.” The Chamber, working in collaboration with other business organizations, testified in opposition to the proposed language, arguing that the deceptive language of the proposal was not truthful in what the proposal would actually accomplish. While the Board did not approve the language of the proposal, the proposal is still able to move forward.

The fiscal year 2025-26 budget was finally passed in October, narrowly avoiding a state government shutdown. The final package was a mixed bag for the business community. On a positive note, the budget included $1.1 billion in new road funding, a long-standing priority to improve critical infrastructure.

However, the legislature funded these investments in part by decoupling Michigan from key federal tax provisions, specifically those related to bonus depreciation and expensing. This move effectively results in a tax increase for capital-intensive businesses. This policy is anti-growth, as it penalizes investment in new equipment and technology at a time when modernization is crucial for competitiveness. Additionally, cuts to Going PRO and the MEDC’s budget raised concerns about the state’s continued ability to fund workforce development and business attraction efforts.

The year concluded with mostly talk of legislative activity in November and December. Senators debated the “Real Jobs for Michigan” job creation package, which is similar to the 2019 “Good Jobs for Michigan” initiative. The Senate successfully passed bills to expand the Transformational Brownfield Plans, a tool the Chamber supports for revitalizing urban cores.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lansing-aerial-feature.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 16:59:56.058123

Health-related legislation was a major focus of the Arkansas General Assembly’s 2025 regular legislative session, and the state will implement many health-related laws in the new year. These actions from lawmakers are intended to address maternal health care, expand access to preventive health services, strengthen the healthcare workforce, and change how some services are covered and delivered under state-regulated health insurance plans.

Arkansas Health Policy Changes

Act 866 requires health plans, as well as Medicaid and the Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME) program, to cover deliveries that occur at a licensed birthing center the same as hospital-based deliveries. Arkansas currently does not have a licensed birthing center, but the law establishes coverage requirements if any are licensed in the state in the future. The law is intended to expand delivery options and support alternative models of maternity care.

Act 627 requires health plans — as well as Medicaid, ARKids First, and ARHOME — to cover breastfeeding and lactation consultant services provided in outpatient settings. This coverage is not subject to annual deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance.

Act 390 requires health plans, as well as Medicaid and ARHOME, to cover lung cancer screening and related follow-up services consistent with American Cancer Society guidelines, without imposing additional cost sharing specific to those services.

Insurance coverage for certain genetic and imaging services will also expand beginning January 1. Act 860 requires insurers to cover genetic testing for inherited cancer-related gene mutations when clinically indicated, as well as specified evidence-based cancer imaging for individuals with an increased risk of cancer.

Act 424 defines breast reconstruction surgery for insurance coverage purposes, requiring insurers to cover all stages of reconstruction following trauma, disease, or mastectomy, as well as reconstruction performed to reduce the risk of future breast disease.

Act 628 requires health plans to cover medically necessary treatment for diseases and conditions caused by severe obesity for adults, including bariatric surgery and related care. The law does not require coverage of injectable glucose-lowering drugs and other medications prescribed for weight loss.

U.S. Health Policy Changes

Several federal health policy changes scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026, will affect coverage affordability, eligibility, and healthcare delivery nationwide.

Changes to federal Health Insurance Marketplace rules will alter how premium tax credits function for some enrollees. The cap on premium tax credit repayments will be removed, increasing the amount that some individuals may be required to repay at tax time if their actual income exceeds projections used to determine subsidy eligibility. This change could increase financial risk for enrollees whose incomes fluctuate during the year.

Eligibility for premium tax credits will also narrow for lawfully present noncitizens. Beginning in January, premium tax credits will no longer be available to lawfully present noncitizens with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level who are ineligible for Medicaid due to immigration status, including lawful permanent residents subject to the five-year Medicaid waiting period for coverage eligibility.

Medicare-related changes will affect both enrollees and providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will launch the Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction (WISeR) Model, a pilot program that introduces new prior authorization requirements in traditional Medicare. The WISeR Model is set to take effect in January in six states: New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, and Washington.

Beginning in 2026, Medicare will apply negotiated drug prices to the first group of Part D drugs selected under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The country has moved beyond hydrogen expansion and nuclear power research by adding up to 60,000,000 solar panels to blanket the country. This mega solar project will work in tandem with another renewable source to expand Australia’s total installed capacity and provide power for hydrogen production, mainly for exports. Find out more below.

Australia goes beyond hydrogen and nuclear power

Australia has made its climate targets exceptionally clear and has set the following targets:

2050 – achieve net-zero

2035 – lowering emissions by 62-70% compared to 2005 levels

2030 – decrease emissions by 43%

To achieve these targets, Australia has been focusing its dedication on renewable energy expansion. It has set goals complementary to its climate targets, such as achieving a green hydrogen capacity of 1 Mt by 2030 and expanding the capacity to 15 Mt by 2050. While some believe that Australia has dabbled in nuclear power, the country, in fact, doesn’t have any commercial nuclear power capacity.

The closest Australia comes to nuclear power is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation’s research with the OPAL reactor and isotope production for medical applications. It is also an exporter of uranium. The country itself is more focused on its green hydrogen production, and to provide enough clean power, it has added up to 60,000,000 solar panels, among others.

Millions of solar panels blanketing the country

Western Australia becomes home to millions of solar panels to blanket the desert. A multi-phased renewable project will bring new life and clean energy to Western Australia’s Mirning traditional lands in the south-east. This multi-phased mega-project, known as the Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH), is ideally located to harness both the energies from the abundant sun and wind.

WGEH will focus on ammonia and green hydrogen production, powered primarily by solar power in tandem with wind power. According to the WGEH website, the hydrogen will be utilised for:

Clean power production

Shipping fuel supplies

Processing of minerals

Heavy transport

So far, an application for WGEH is being prepared to achieve status as a Commonwealth Major Project. Its “Concept Feasibility Study” has been completed. An in-depth environmental impact review is also underway.

Up to 60,000,000 panels and more

The scale of the WGEH project is mind-boggling. Up to 60,000,000 solar panels will cover between 15,000 and 20,000+ square kilometres across 35 PV farms. To supplement the massive solar production, the project will also consist of 3,000 wind turbines. The proposed project still has a long way to go regarding its planning and development, with construction reportedly to start only in 2029, depending on the final investment status.

In its first phase, the combined renewable power production will be up to 8 GW. Beyond substantial clean energy production, the WGEH project will also have the following advantages:

Indigenous partnership, with the Mirning community holding 10% equity and a permanent board seat

Creation of nearly 3,000 construction jobs and 400 permanent jobs

Increased support for local businesses

Regional industry development, including

desalination facilities, marine offloading facility, regional hubs

Low levels of habitat disruption

It has been six years since the project’s location was selected, and while some may not even live to see the mega-project in full operation status, as some believe it will take 30 years once construction starts, slow and steady does win the race. As stakeholders continue the battle to move the project’s status along, we believe that many look forward to the positive impact the mega-project will have locally and internationally, especially as it contributes to the global mission of achieving net-zero.

DEQ attributes the decline of air pollution emissions to efforts by state leaders, regulatory agencies, electric utilities, industry and the public to significantly address air quality concerns over the last 50 years.
“Even as our population and economy continue to grow, North Carolina’s air quality keeps getting better and better,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson.
According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022.
From 1993-2022, combined emissions of federally designated Hazardous Air Pollutants and state-designated Toxic Air Pollutants have fallen by more than 108 million pounds, an 82% drop.","North Carolinians continue to breathe the cleanest air in decades as emissions of harmful air pollutants like ozone and fine particles continue a long-running downward trend.

Today, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Air Quality is publishing its latest update to the “Air Quality Trends in North Carolina” report. DEQ attributes the decline of air pollution emissions to efforts by state leaders, regulatory agencies, electric utilities, industry and the public to significantly address air quality concerns over the last 50 years. Statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, in particular, reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Even as our population and economy continue to grow, North Carolina’s air quality keeps getting better and better,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “By controlling air pollution, we are giving every North Carolinian a cleaner, healthier future.”

“Our air quality continues to improve thanks to tireless efforts by our dedicated staff, partners and a wide variety of stakeholders who have come together to implement sound environmental policies,” said Mike Abraczinskas, Director of the Division of Air Quality.

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022. Specifically, emissions fell:

95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2)

74 % for carbon monoxide (CO)

71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx)

48% for fine particles (PM2.5)

67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Not surprisingly, North Carolina’s outdoor air quality has improved as emissions have fallen. Measured concentrations of those air pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade. Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

North Carolina’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes. More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy. Energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings also reduce emissions from power plants.

Cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads also emit far less pollution than older vehicles, thanks to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls. From 1990 through 2022, CO, NOx, and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from these on-road sources of air pollution. The state expects to see further reductions from the transportation sector in the coming years due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles.

High concentrations of air pollutants can harm public and environmental health. Ground-level ozone (formed from VOCs and NOx) and fine particles can worsen asthma and contribute to heart and lung conditions. Pollutants such as SO2 are associated with haze and acid rain. Greenhouse gases contribute to climate change, and various hazardous air pollutants are known carcinogens. North Carolina has seen reductions in emissions of each of these classes of pollutants.

Some additional findings of the updated report:

The number of ozone exceedance days statewide continues to be low. From 2015-2024, North Carolina recorded just two days of “Code Red” or above for ozone in the state, compared to 83 such days from 2005-2014.

Visibility in our national and state parks has improved noticeably in the last three decades, due to reductions in emissions of SO2, NOx and other air pollutants that scatter light. For example, in 2023, visitors could see as far as 119 miles at Great Smoky Mountains National Park during an average clear day, compared with just 54 miles in 1996.

Net greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion have decreased by 38% from 2005 to 2020 due to both a shift in fuel use and increased energy efficiency. During this same period, North Carolina’s population and real Gross State Product grew by 20% and 23%, respectively.

“FERC required neither and has failed impacted communities in its Southgate decision.” Southgate has been a subject of debate since it was proposed in 2018.","A controversial proposed natural gas pipeline in North Carolina has passed the latest hurdle to move forward, receiving approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

FERC announced Thursday it has approved an amendment to change the route, pipe diameter and gas-carrying capacity for the Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project. This means Southgate would extend the pipeline from Pittsylvania County, Virginia into Rockingham County, North Carolina.

Opponents to Southgate say the project needed a new application, not an amendment, because the pipeline’s proposed route, size and impact have changed drastically since FERC issued the original Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in 2020.

Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator at Appalachian Voices, said Southgate will harm Virginia and North Carolina waterways and communities.

“The project necessitated, at the very least, an environmental impact statement. Ideally, this totally revamped project should require a new application to fully consider its impacts,” Sims said. “FERC required neither and has failed impacted communities in its Southgate decision.”

Southgate has been a subject of debate since it was proposed in 2018. North Carolina’s DEQ denied a water quality permit for the project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.

The controversy has continued in recent months.

Earlier this year, environmental advocates mounted a challenge to the methane gas pipeline. In October, a FERC analysis found the project potentially redundant.

“Right now, people want to see lower electric bills and know their drinking water is safe,” said Steph Gans, assistant director at Clean Water for North Carolina. “This decision does the opposite; it will raise bills and pollute water.”

These concerns come about as a rival pipeline undergoes a permitting process at the same time. The Williams Companies expansion of their Transco pipelines, called the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, expects to receive a decision from FERC on a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in early February.

FERC’s October analysis said the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project could eliminate needs for Southgate, NC Newsline previously reported.

“We conclude the Transco System Alternative would be technically and economically feasible and practical,” FERC staff wrote in the document.

In the meantime, the North Carolina DEQ’s Division of Air Quality issued permit modifications for two compressor stations associated with the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project on Thursday.

Transco plans to upgrade two existing compressor stations along the pipeline — one in Mooresville and one in Lexington.

“The leading preference is that neither [pipeline is] built because of the level of emissions that they would bring, and that’s locking us into decades more of fossil fuel infrastructure,” Sims told NC Newsline. “Neither project serves the communities through which it passes.”

Shawn Day, a spokesperson for MVP Southgate, said the amended project is necessary to meet public demand for natural gas and its construction and operation will not have a significant environmental impact.

He pointed out that in the October environmental assessment, FERC’s “staff analysis here does not consider non-environmental aspects of the project objectives, such as supply diversity and other market issues, which could affect the ultimate viability of the system alternative.”

Representatives for FERC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We look forward to securing all necessary authorizations to build this important project, to provide homes and businesses across North Carolina with the affordable, reliable and lower-carbon energy needed to power modern life,” Day wrote in an email.

Manufacturing today is hiring—and struggling to fill hundreds of thousands of open roles—despite modest job losses over the past year. Investment—driven by reshoring, foreign direct investment and federal policies like the CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act— is fueling new factories, expansions and long-term demand for skilled workers.

The problem, Fast Company writes, is perception.

Many workers still view manufacturing as unstable, low-tech or undesirable, even as modern facilities rely on advanced technology, offer competitive pay and play a central role in clean energy, supply-chain resilience and national security.

During Hurricane Helene, the Asheville bookstore and co-op Firestorm Books served as a community hub, where people dropped off and picked up supplies. But for almost a week after the storm, the shop could not provide the disaster relief work the staff really wanted to do. Although Firestorm had solar panels, the shop had no way to store that energy for a long period of time, leaving staff unable to offer critical services like refrigerating food or offering a powered space to the community after sunset.

“A lot of people were contributing and donating perishables, but we weren't really able to hold those because we didn't have operational generators,” said Libertie Valance, a Firestorm staff member. “People weren't able to charge power tools. There were a lot of people coordinating things like tree removal from around our space.”

The frustration of having solar panels they couldn't actually use during the blackout led the co-op to look for solutions. After Helene, they reached out to the Footprint Project, a nonprofit that works to build small-scale renewable energy projects in disaster-impacted communities. The organization donated an inverter and 20 kilowatt-hours of battery capacity, while Firestorm secured a zero-interest loan from the Appalachian Solar Finance Fund to complete the installation.

The store can now use power off-grid in case of an emergency.

“That will run our building for about 24 hours without the sun being out,” Valance said.

Devin Williams, a project manager for the Footprint Project, told BPR that this work is part of a larger mission to build disaster-resilient communities through small-scale renewable energy projects. The nonprofit is based in New Orleans and arrived in the region to assist with the response to Hurricane Helene.

“And then there was just a huge need,” Williams noted, describing the devastation in Western North Carolina, “and they opened up a wing in Asheville.”

That local presence has grown into a major state partnership. Footprint is now part of a project funded by the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to support community resilience hubs, or “beehives”, throughout the region. The State Energy Office received $10.4 million from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for use over the next five years. Of that, $5 million is earmarked for this microgrid initiative, which will install up to 24 stationary systems at critical locations like a fire station in Burnsville.

Data Center Development Typically, data center developers build out DCFs in incremental phases where construction of a new source is accomplished in contemporaneous increments.","Virginia has emerged as the dominant data center market in the world, driven by exponential growth in data storage and processing demand associated with artificial intelligence and cloud computing. With that growth has come increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly with respect to air permitting for backup power systems.

Over the past year, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has issued several guidance and clarification memoranda addressing how existing air regulations apply to data center development and operation:

Clarification #2025-01

Clarification #2025-02

Clarification #2025-03

Guidance Memo APG-578

Although these documents do not have the force of regulation, they provide important insight into DEQ’s permitting and enforcement approach.

Regulation of Emergency Generators

As DEQ explains in Clarification #2025-01, many data centers rely on reciprocating internal combustion engine driven generators (gen-sets) for backup use in the event of a power outage. These gen-sets may be classified as “emergency” units under federal and Virginia air regulations, a classification that carries important regulatory and permitting consequences. Critically, however, the definition of “emergency” differs in meaningful ways between EPA’s federal framework and Virginia’s air regulations, and those differences are central to understanding DEQ’s recent guidance affecting data center development and operation.

At the federal level, EPA’s broader definition of emergency under the New Source Performance Standards focuses primarily on the unavailability of the primary power source.[1] In Virginia, an emergency is more narrowly defined as “a condition that arises from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events where the primary energy or power source is disrupted or disconnected due to conditions beyond the control of an owner of a source” and, relevant here, includes a “failure of the electric grid.”[2] Previously, DEQ took the position that an energy provider’s scheduled power outage did not constitute an “emergency” because sources would have advance notice; therefore, the outage would not be “sudden and reasonably unforeseeable.” This interpretation created practical challenges for data centers that are interconnected with utilities or power plants and rely on generators during known or coordinated outages, even where those generators are serving a traditional backup function.

When a Planned Outage Can be an “Emergency”

Against this backdrop, DEQ issued Guidance Memo APG-578 on September 30, 2025, to revise the meaning of “sudden and reasonably unforeseeable” within the context of scheduled power outages “when they are beyond the control of a [source].” As a result, DEQ will “allow the use of emergency generators for a planned outage if a source is notified about the event within fourteen (14) calendar days or less” and satisfies several additional requirements.

It is important to note that not every planned power outage will constitute an emergency. According to Guidance Memo APG-578, DEQ will assess each situation based on the totality of the circumstances. Therefore, data centers should consider taking the following proactive steps so that, in the case of a planned power outage, their actions satisfy DEQ’s requirements for the agency to find that the circumstances constitute an “emergency.”

Implement monitoring and reporting processes for emergency generator use. Sources must be able to articulate, with supporting documentation, that emergency generator use is necessary in a particular circumstance. Additionally, permitted sources are obligated to communicate estimated and actual operation and fuel combustion data. This may be complicated depending on the size of the source and the number of emergency generators being operated. Sources should develop monitoring and reporting processes that streamline this process to allow for uncomplicated communication.

Develop an action plan for scheduled power outages. Sources are expected to communicate a plan of action in the case of a planned power outage. According to DEQ guidance, sources should prepare to communicate at least 1) estimated time that emergency generators will run, 2) which generators the permittee plans to use, and 3) the proposed generator’s rates of electrical capacity. Sources should proactively develop plans tailored to different situations. This will prepare sources for potential outages and facilitate prompt communication with DEQ.

Data Center Air Permit Guidelines

On January 17, 2025, DEQ issued Clarification #2025-02 to provide clarification regarding the implementation of certain air permit regulations for data center stationary sources. Notably, this memo provided clarification regarding multiple data center facilities (DCF) and data center development, among other issues.

Multiple Data Center Facilities

DEQ has faced various complexities related to siting data centers, especially when a new data center facility is developed in close proximity to one or more existing or proposed data center facilities. In this case, DEQ must determine whether the proposed pattern of development constitutes separate stationary sources (requiring individual permits for each data center) or a single stationary source (requiring only a single permit). Under both Virginia and EPA regulations, data centers must be aggregated into a single stationary source when emitting activities are under common control, within the same industrial category, and located on properties either contiguous or adjacent to one another. Neither Virginia nor EPA has established a specific distance to make data center properties “adjacent” for the purpose of single-source determinations. Previous DEQ guidance suggests that adjacency determinations should be conducted on a case-by-case basis based on “the common sense notion of a plant” and consideration of the physical distance between property boundaries.

Clarification #2025-02 affirmed these general principles and provided more concrete benchmarks for determining whether properties are adjacent. DEQ provided the following benchmarks (based on property boundaries):

Multiple DCFs separated by 0.25 miles or greater are generally not adjacent.

Multiple DCFs separated by less than 0.25 miles but greater than 0.125 miles require consideration based on the “common sense notion of a plant” on a case-by-case basis.

Multiple DCFs separated by less than 0.125 miles are generally adjacent.

Regarding past decisions, the memo states that DEQ does not intend to revisit past adjacency determinations based solely on the new guidance, but it may reevaluate them if circumstances subsequently change, to include property boundary adjustments and ownership transfers.

Data Center Development

Typically, data center developers build out DCFs in incremental phases where construction of a new source is accomplished in contemporaneous increments. These increments may be aggregated for determining certain regulatory requirements, including permitting applicability. For Virgina’s minor new source review program, a period of five years is utilized when determining if incremental changes are contemporaneous.[3]

Construction Activities Before a Permit

New Minor Source Review Air Permit Regulations prohibit the actual construction or operation of any new stationary source or relevant project without first obtaining an air permit.[4] The regulations define “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of permanent physical on-site construction of an emissions unit.” In Clarification #2025-03, DEQ clarifies that the following activities do not fall within the definition of “begin actual construction” and therefore are permitted before obtaining an air permit:

Certain site preparation work such as grading.

Storing and staging equipment on proposed construction sites in the absence construction activities that are integral to the emission unit (g., installing foundations, constructing permanent structures, running electrical wiring, laying underground pipework, etc.).

Construction on aspects of a project that will not support or house emissions units, such as buildings that will house servers or other computer equipment, provided those buildings do not contain backup or emergency generators requiring an air permit.

DEQ has stated that compliance determinations in this context are typically based on observable on-site conditions. As a result, while certain preparatory and non-emissions-unit construction activities may proceed prior to permit issuance, developers must take care to avoid construction activity that could be viewed as permanent and integral to an emissions unit before the required air permit is obtained.

Practical Takeaways for Data Center Owners and Developers

It is critical for data centers to maintain reliable and uninterrupted power, especially in light of growing use and dependence on AI, and the strict requirements under many data center leases and service agreements. Recent DEQ guidance provides insight on how it intends to apply existing air regulations related to the development and operation of data centers. Going forward, data centers should:

Engage DEQ regional air staff early in project planning to confirm permitting pathways and reduce the risk of delays.

Build an outage response process that tracks Guidance Memo APG-578’s notice, documentation, and reporting steps.

Consider DEQ’s adjacency distance ranges when siting multiple DCFs to determine whether it is treated as a single stationary source.

Model emissions over the contemplated development window, recognizing that phased construction within a roughly five-year window may be aggregated for minor new source review purposes.

Consider how the foregoing could affect existing real estate documents such as leases, service agreements, and construction contracts, particularly as it relates to the definition of an “emergency” under force majeure clauses, the remedies available to tenants, and whether a property transfer could trigger an adjacency reevaluation.

Sequence construction properly to avoid inadvertently beginning actual construction before a permit is issued.

A member of the IEEE Power & Energy Society, he says its publications, webinars, conferences, and networking events keep him current on new developments.","Demand for electricity is up in the United States, and so is its price. One way to increase supply and lower costs is to build new power plants, but that can take years and cost a fortune. Talgat Kopzhanov is working on a faster, more affordable solution: the generator replacement interconnection process.

The technique links renewable energy sources to the grid connections of shuttered or underutilized power facilities and coal plants. The process uses the existing interconnection rights and infrastructure when generating electricity, eliminating the years-long approval process for constructing new U.S. power facilities.

Kopzhanov explains the technique in an on-demand educational webinar, Unlocking Surplus Interconnection Service. Colocating Renewable and Thermal Power Plants, hosted by the IEEE Power & Energy Society. The webinar is available to the public for a fee.

Kopzhanov has been involved with several recent generator replacement interconnection installations. In May the Sherco Solar project in Sherburne County, Minn., replaced a retiring coal plant with approximately 720 megawatts of solar-powered generators, making it the largest solar-generating facility in the region. The first 460 MW of capacity is expected to be operational soon.

Another new project, developed with Middle River, is a battery system installed in April at California’s Hanford Hybrid Energy Center, a natural gas reliability facility. It used existing and incremental interconnection capacity to add the storage system. The surplus renewable energy from the batteries will be used during peak times to reduce the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a Silicon Valley Clean Energy article about the installation.

“These projects are uniquely positioned to be colocated with existing power plants,” Kopzhanov says. “But, at the same time, they are renewable and sustainable sources of power—which is also helping to decarbonize the environment and meet the emission-reduction goals of the state.”

Influenced by Kazakhstan’s power industry

Born and raised in Taraz, Kazakhstan, Kopzhanov was surrounded by relatives who worked in the power industry. It’s not surprising that he has pursued a career in the field.

Until 1991, when the country was still a Soviet republic, most Kazakhs were required to help build the country’s power and transmission systems, he says. His mother and father are chemical engineers, and his grandfather was involved in the power industry. They told him about how they designed the transformers and overhead power lines. From a young age, he knew he wanted to be an engineer too, he says.

Today the Central Asian country is a major producer of oil, gas, and coal.

Kopzhanov left Kazakhstan in 2008 to pursue a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Purdue University, in West Lafayette, Ind.

After graduating in 2012, he was hired as an electrical design engineer by Fluor Corp. in Farnborough, England. He oversaw the development of a master plan for a power project there. He also engineered and designed high-voltage switchgears, substations, and transformers.

“Every power plant has its own interconnection rights but, amazingly, most are not fully utilizing them.”

In 2015 he joined ExxonMobil in Houston, working as a project manager. During his six years there, he held managerial positions. Eventually, he was promoted to asset advisor and was responsible for evaluating the feasibility of investing in decarbonization and electrification projects by identifying their risks and opportunities.

He decided he wanted to learn more about the business aspects of running a company, so he left in 2021 to pursue an MBA at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, in Bloomington. During his MBA program, he briefly worked as a consultant for a lithium-ion manufacturing firm, offering advice on the viability of their proposed projects and investments.

“Engineers aren’t typically connected to the business world,” he says, “but having an understanding of what the needs are and tailoring your future goals toward that is extremely important. In my view, that’s how you’ll become a great technical expert. I definitely recommend that engineers have some kind of understanding of the business side.”

He joined Middle River shortly after graduating from Indiana with his MBA in 2023.

The power of membership

Kopzhanov was introduced to IEEE by a colleague at ExxonMobil after he asked the member about an IEEE plaque displayed on his desk. The coworker explained the activities he was involved in, as well as the process for joining. Kopzhanov became a member in 2019, left, and then rejoined in 2023.

“That was one of the best decisions I have made,” he says.

A member of the IEEE Power & Energy Society, he says its publications, webinars, conferences, and networking events keep him current on new developments.

“Being able to follow what’s happening in the industry, especially in the space where you’re working, is something that has benefited me a lot,” he says.

An active IEEE volunteer, he is the founding chair of the Power & Energy Society’s Chicago chapter, which has about 400 members. He is on the chapter’s executive committee, and he helps organize conferences, update the website, and review research papers.

“It’s those little things that have a significant impact,” he says. “Volunteering is a key piece of belonging to IEEE.”",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-dressed-in-a-long-sleeve-black-shirt-and-jeans-wearing-a-yellow-fluorescent-jacket-and-sunglasses-stands-in-front-of-a-sol.jpg?id=62609741&width=600,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:30.897178

World Nuclear Association's Director General, Dr Sama Bilbao y León, represented and advocated for the nuclear industry to a senior finance and business audience at a standing-room-only CNBC’s New Energy Finance event, and contributed to several private roundtables and conversations.

The discussion, ""Reality of Renewables in an AI World,"" moderated by Steve Sedgwick, featured Dr Bilbao y León alongside Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer of Masdar. The central theme explored how the explosive growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming energy and infrastructure, necessitating a massive reallocation of capital to build the power and data centre capacity to sustain it.

The AI Energy Surge and the Grid Challenge

The consensus was clear: the surge in AI-driven electricity demand has crystallized and brought forward existing energy problems, including grid overload, utility bill affordability, and the fundamental need for ""clean joules."" The world requires substantially more clean energy to grow in an economically sustainable way.

Dr Bilbao y León stressed that the demand isn't just AI; the entire industrial economy needs reliable decarbonization, which nuclear energy is uniquely positioned to offer.

> Grid Overload and Affordability: Strong energy demand growth, 3-4% per annum or higher, is a relatively new challenge for advanced markets but a persistent issue in developing economies.

> Insufficient Existing Solutions: Current policies are heavily reliant on renewable energy (RE), which cannot alone solve the complex challenge of providing a reliable and clean grid, affordable utility bills, and economic development simultaneously.

> Nuclear's Intrinsic Value: Nuclear is experiencing a resurgence because of its core attributes—reliability, longevity, energy density, and its role in the clean energy transition. This leads to crucial second-order benefits like attracting energy-intensive industrial investments, and low land usage and protection of ecosystems. In addition, nuclear energy also helps attaining several policy and societal goals at once, from affordability and access, to lowering emissions and energy security.

Dr Bilbao y León asserted that meeting the demand for affordable, 24/7 clean energy to fuel the AI era and global prosperity is a formidable equation. A complex equation that does not have a unique simple solution that fits all.

AI growth, much like economic growth, cannot be powered by renewables and grid-scale storage alone. The challenge is far bigger: it requires us to think in terms of the entire system. Yes, we will need vast amounts of new generation, but that is only one piece of the puzzle. Equally critical is the enormous investment required to modernize and expand the electric grid — an essential backbone of our economy that has been neglected for decades.

At the same time, we must look beyond hardware to the markets that drive the system. Across jurisdictions, work is underway to design market structures that properly value every element of a resilient, low-carbon energy mix: generation, capacity, 24/7 availability, inertia, voltage, frequency, stability, reliability, resilience, and of course carbon reduction. These signals are vital — they incentivize long-term planning and investment not only by utilities, but also by large energy users, ultimately ensuring affordable power for households and businesses alike.

For policymakers, the task is clear: consider the system in its entirety. Develop policies and industrial strategies that send unmistakable signals to the private sector and lay out a credible long-term roadmap. With that foundation, financiers and industry leaders can step forward with confidence, seizing what is, in truth, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a clean energy system that is resilient, future-proof, and ready to power the AI revolution.

We must acknowledge that there is no single silver bullet for the energy challenge — every tool in the toolbox has a vital role to play. Among them, nuclear power already stands as a proven pillar of reliable, carbon-free electricity. Yet to truly meet the demands of a clean, resilient future, the world will need far more nuclear capacity than what exists today.

Crucially, hyperscalers (large tech companies), operating on a global model, are increasingly interested in nuclear because reactors provide scale to deliver their full economic benefits. They are seeking long-term power availability and grid reliability, evidenced by efficient and promising nuclear partnerships in the US. These tech giants are adopting ""fleet views,"" and making investments that reflect a long-term economic commitment to nuclear power.

World Nuclear Association advocates to move away from incrementalism to scaled nuclear, including both large reactors and innovations like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Reactors (ARs).

National Strategies and the Financial Shift

The discussion moved to national strategies, where the Association highlighted the intersection of economic growth and energy security.

Nuclear partnerships are built to last for decades—possibly even 100 years—offering a compounding benefit as host countries develop nuclear skills and supply chain capacities. This ensures that countries can continue to build and rely on their domestic capabilities and resources to provide reliable, clean power at scale.

Nuclear energy costs are de-correlated from fossil fuel cycles and weather patterns, offering a powerful engine for sustained economic growth without commodity volatility.

We need to demystify nuclear and challenge the notion that nuclear projects are currently too challenging or are the eminent domain of government or that we need NOAK projects before mainstream finance can participate. Dr Bilbao y León argued there is nothing inherently unique in nuclear projects that make them infinitely more difficult to finance or execute than other types. Like any other class of complex capital-intensive infrastructure with high initial investment, long lifecycles, and a positive social and economic development not just because of the energy it generates but also through the jobs it creates and sustains, it is necessary to strike a balance between government instruments and market support.

Building massive, capital-intensive infrastructure with intangible social value is nothing new — and the financial community has long mastered the art of structuring win‑win partnerships to make it happen. Nuclear projects face the same challenges as any other large-scale development: market risk, construction risk, and the hurdle of securing initial funding. These are real risks, but they are not “nuclear risks.”

2025: The Year of Nuclear Finance

The finance sector's commitment to nuclear reached a new level in 2025:

> World Bank Policy Shift: The Association hailed a ""momentous shift"" as the World Bank's changed its lending policies allowing financing for nuclear energy projects, including new developments, securing operating extensions for existing reactors, and grid upgrades. This is a strong signal for other multilateral development banks and the global finance community, and it supports the estimated $150 billion annual investment opportunity required to meet the 2050 tripling goal.

> Africa Energy Week (AEW 2025): Nuclear was positioned as central to unlocking long-term capital for Africa's clean energy transition, with bold statements from both governments and various African development banks and a focus on strong governance and public-private partnerships.

> Asia Development Bank Shift: The multilateral development bank has amended its energy policy, paving the way for it to support developing member countries that choose to pursue nuclear power. Across Asia there are more than 300 reactors under construction, planned and proposed.

> COP30 in Belém: World Nuclear Association announced the expansion of its coalition supporting the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050, with new financial institutions like Stifel and CIBC joining the Financial Institutions Statement of Support.

To achieve financial readiness, investors need to understand and be comfortable with the benefits, costs, and risks of nuclear projects, and how these flow through the life cycle of the asset. The best way to achieve this is through revenue and finance models that help capture, monetize, and allocate these elements (well-known and fact-based, systemic benefits, costs, and risks) and shows how risks and returns change over time.

To address some of the lack of clarity and understanding around financing nuclear, World Nuclear Association is focusing on the ""financing supply chain,"" launching the Financing Nuclear Briefing Series (FNBS) to improve knowledge and dialogue among governments, multilateral development banks, financiers, and the nuclear industry. The aim is to ensure competitive nuclear projects achieve a timely Final Investment Decision (FID).

Strengthening the Bonds between Finance and Nuclear

As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the focus remains on deepening financial and nuclear engagement, including developing an Investment Guide, co-created by the nuclear and financial communities, which we hope will further deepen collaboration and – ultimately - investment in the scaled nuclear solutions required for the future.

World Nuclear Association’s regular Financing Nuclear Briefing Series will continue to be a major forum for these high-level conversations and another way for the Association to support our members as they navigate the evolving nuclear finance landscape.

In 2026, the Association will once again host the Finance Summit at its unique, global annual gathering of the nuclear industry: World Nuclear Symposium, taking place in London from 9-11 September. For the financial community, the Summit and World Nuclear Symposium provide an unparalleled stocktake of the opportunities across the global nuclear value chain.",,N,,2025-12-19 16:59:31.323481

On Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders called for a nationwide halt to data center construction until regulations are put in place.
More data centers = lots more transmission fights.
Only one factor distinguishes data center fights from renewable energy fights: building the former potentially raises energy bills, while the latter will lower energy costs.
Rural counties are already enacting moratoria on solar and wind in tandem with data centers – this is not new.","It’s now clear that 2026 will be big for American energy, but it’s going to be incredibly tense.

Over the past 365 days, we at The Fight have closely monitored numerous conflicts over siting and permitting for renewable energy and battery storage projects. As we’ve done so, the data center boom has come into full view, igniting a tinderbox of resentment over land use, local governance and, well, lots more. The future of the U.S. economy and the energy grid may well ride on the outcomes of the very same city council and board of commissioners meetings I’ve been reporting on every day. It’s a scary yet exciting prospect.

To bring us into the new year, I wanted to try something a little different. Readers ask me all the time for advice with questions like, What should I be thinking about right now? And, How do I get this community to support my project? Or my favorite: When will people finally just shut up and let us build things? To try and answer these questions and more, I wanted to give you the top five trends in energy development (and data centers) I’ll be watching next year.

1. The AI data center backlash is growing faster than you thought.

The best thing going for American renewable energy right now is the AI data center boom. But the backlash against developing these projects is spreading incredibly fast.

Do you remember last week when I told you about a national environmental group calling for data center moratoria across the country? On Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders called for a nationwide halt to data center construction until regulations are put in place. The next day, the Working Families Party – a progressive third party that fields candidates all over the country for all levels of government – called for its candidates to run in opposition to new data center construction.

On the other end of the political spectrum, major figures in the American right wing have become AI skeptics critical of the nascent data center buildout, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. These figures are clearly following the signals amidst the noise; I have watched in recent months as anti-data center fervor has spread across Facebook, with local community pages and groups once focused on solar and wind projects pivoting instead to focus on data centers in development near them.

In other words, I predicted just one month ago, an anti-data center political movement is forming across the country and quickly gaining steam (ironically aided by the internet and algorithms powered by server farms).

2. More data centers = lots more transmission fights.

I often hear from the clean energy sector that the data center boom will be a boon for new projects. Renewable energy is the fastest to scale and construct, the thinking goes, and therefore will be the quickest, easiest, and most cost effective way to meet the projected spike in energy demand.

I’m not convinced yet that this line of thinking is correct. But I’m definitely sure that no matter the fuel type, we can expect a lot more transmission development, and nothing sparks a land use fight more easily than new wires.

Past is prologue here. One must look no further than the years-long fight over the Piedmont Reliability Project, a proposed line that would connect a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania to data centers in Virginia by crossing a large swathe of Maryland agricultural land. I’ve been covering it closely since we put the project in our inaugural list of the most at-risk projects, and the conflict is now a clear blueprint.

In Wisconsin, a billion-dollar transmission project is proving this thesis true. I highly recommend readers pay close attention to Port Washington, where the release of fresh transmission line routes for a massive new data center this week has aided an effort to recall the city’s mayor for supporting the project. And this isn’t even an interstate project like Piedmont.

3. The data center backlash is coming for renewable energy.

While I may not be sure of the renewable energy sector’s longer-term benefits from data center development, I’m far more confident that this Big Tech land use backlash is hitting projects right now.

The short-term issue for renewables developers is that opponents of data centers use arguments and tactics similar to those deployed by anti-solar and anti-wind advocates. Everyone fighting data centers is talking about ending development on farmland, avoiding changes to property values, stopping excess noise and water use, and halting irreparable changes to their ways of life.

Only one factor distinguishes data center fights from renewable energy fights: building the former potentially raises energy bills, while the latter will lower energy costs.

I do fear that as data center fights intensify nationwide, communities will not ban or hyper-regulate the server farms in particular, but rather will pass general bans that also block the energy projects that could potentially power them. Rural counties are already enacting moratoria on solar and wind in tandem with data centers – this is not new. But the problem will worsen as conflicts spread, and it will be incumbent upon the myriad environmentalists boosting data center opponents to not accidentally aid those fighting zero-carbon energy.

4. Trump will start slowly approving renewables.

This week, the Bureau of Land Management approved its first solar project in months: the Libra facility in Nevada. When this happened, I received a flood of enthusiastic and optimistic emails and texts from sources.

We do not yet know whether the Libra approval is a signal of a thaw inside the Trump administration. The Interior Department’s freeze on renewables permitting decisions continues mostly unabated, and I have seen nothing to indicate that more decisions like this are coming down the pike. What we do know is that ahead of a difficult midterm election, the Trump administration faces outsized pressure to do more to address “affordability,” Democrats plan to go after Republicans for effectively repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and halting permits for solar and wind projects, and there’s a grand bargain to be made in Congress over permitting reform that rides on an end to the permitting freeze.

I anticipate that ahead of the election and further permitting talks in Congress, the Trump administration will mildly ease its chokehold on solar and wind permits because that is the most logical option in front of them. I do not think this will change the circumstances for more than a small handful of projects sited on federal lands that were already deep in the permitting process when Trump took power.

5. Battery fire fears continue to spread after Moss Landing.

It’s impossible to conclude a conversation about next year’s project fights without ending on the theme that defined 2025: battery fire fears are ablaze, and they’ll only intensify as data centers demand excess energy storage capacity.

The January Moss Landing fire incident was a defining moment for an energy sector struggling to grapple with the effects of the Internet age. Despite bearing little resemblance to the litany of BESS proposals across the country, that one hunk of burning battery wreckage in California inspired countless communities nationwide to ban new battery storage outright.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjYwNDMyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDc3MTExNn0.-Kfl9GMkRehgQAV-dfIJuJYPzWbFcJusbz9hIEI1SoM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-19 16:02:16.930472

That’s the conclusion of a new report by three state agencies that foreshadows an upcoming state grid planning process and a potential legislative fight on how lawmakers will regulate power-hungry data centers, if at all.

The projected shortfalls would begin in the Commonwealth Edison service territory in northern Illinois by 2029 and in the Ameren service area that covers most of downstate Illinois by 2031. They’d continue to worsen and make Illinois more reliant on energy imports without action by state policymakers or grid operators.

“The challenges emerge from a combination of factors at the regional and national scale,” the report noted. “Load growth is accelerating, driven by data centers, transportation demand, and industrial expansion. At the same time, many coal, gas, and oil units are planned to retire across both RTOs (regional transmission organizations) due to age, economics, and emissions limits.”

The warning from the Illinois Power Agency, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Commerce Commission came the same week that prices once again rose at a procurement event in the area that serves northern Illinois consumers.

Read the report: 2025 Resource Adequacy Study.

Advocates behind recent renewable energy reforms and the governor who says he will sign them argue the report’s findings prove that a plan passed by lawmakers in October was essential to avoiding a potential crisis.

“The state set up a deliberate process to address findings from this resource adequacy study and ensure Illinois continues to lead the country in delivering a clean, reliable, affordable energy future for all,” Gov. JB Pritzker’s office said in a statement.

Critics, including the state’s manufacturers, say the report makes clear that Illinois’ decarbonization policies were overly ambitious.

“We didn’t need a 222-page report to tell us what we already know — Illinois is facing an energy crisis resulting from the forced closure of dispatchable baseload generation and growing demand,” Mark Denzler, president & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said in a statement.

Grid planning and capacity

Warnings of the potential shortfall were contained in the most recent resource adequacy report that state regulators are required to file under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA, energy overhaul passed in 2021. The report, published Monday, precedes a “mitigation” planning process to be undertaken by the Illinois Power Agency.

One of the marquee measures in CEJA called for taking all of the state’s fossil fuel generators offline by 2045, but the plan also created the less-heralded resource adequacy process to assess whether that timeline is feasible.

While the resource adequacy report didn’t specifically call for walking back CEJA’s mandatory 2045 fossil fuel plant closure timeline, that possibility could be considered as regulators prepare the mitigation plan and embark on another major grid planning process in 2026.

But even if Illinois delays closure dates, it’s going to need new generators, the report noted.

Another measure the governor has pledged to sign, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, aims to add battery generation to the grid while creating other energy efficiency and planning processes.

CRGA — Illinois’ third major energy and decarbonization bill passed since 2016 — requires the Illinois Commerce Commission to conduct an integrated resource planning process in 2026. The report noted the goal is to “provide a more comprehensive venue for addressing many of the foundational issues” in grid reliability.

“While this study underscores serious challenges, Illinois has already taken steps to address resource adequacy — a problem the entire country is facing,” Solar Powers Illinois, an advocacy group for the state’s solar industry that backed CRGA, said in a statement. The group added that integrated resource planning will be a “a transparent, data-driven process to evaluate supply and demand, identify risks, and secure cost-effective solutions.”

Problems go beyond Illinois

While Illinois will begin that planning effort next year, the issues facing the state’s grids are not unique. The two multistate, federally regulated regional transmission organizations that serve Illinois — PJM Interconnection in northern Illinois and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator everywhere else — face their own challenges with out-of-state plant closures and growing load demands.

At any rate, the report noted, if the grid can’t replace retiring resources in a timely fashion, it would increase grid strain and lead to higher prices at capacity auctions, a cost that would be borne by consumers.

“If regional markets remain short, Illinois will face persistent high capacity prices even if it builds new resources in-state,” the report noted.

PJM serves 67 million customers in 13 states and Washington, D.C., including 4.2 million Commonwealth Edison customers in northern Illinois, making it the largest grid operator in the U.S.

On Wednesday, it announced the results of its most recent auction for “capacity,” which describes payments ratepayers make to power generators to ensure grid reliability. Capacity charges make up roughly 20% of a monthly power bill.

The price per megawatt-day at the most recent PJM auction hit a record of $333.44 for 2027-28, up $4.27 from the previous year but still 11.5 times higher than just three years prior.

The Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois consumer advocacy group, said the news shows the capacity market “is breaking under the weight of data center demand and a dysfunctional interconnection queue.”

PJM’s interconnection queue largely dictates how quickly new generators can come online, and advocates and the governor have long called for reforms. The report noted it has improved since PJM created new processes in 2023.

But it still takes five to seven years to get gas turbines online, while siting and permitting can also cause delays. The report also noted supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and domestic content requirements for tax credit eligibility could also delay wind and solar coming online.

“Without real reforms, in just a few years 67 million electric customers in the PJM footprint could face rolling blackouts and an escalation of power bills that make the current price spikes seem tame,” Moskowitz said in a statement.

Report's recommendations

As fossil fuel plants in Illinois go offline due to CEJA’s mandates, it could make the state reliant on importing energy from other zones within the regional transmission organizations — even as the RTOs themselves face shortfalls.

Because of that, the state will need new generation “even if Illinois retains a portion of its existing thermal fleet.” To address the potential shortages, Illinois must employ a “diversified resource strategy,” according to the report.

“This includes combining continued growth of new in-state wind and solar supported by IPA procurements and programs, greater use of existing and planned transmission to import power from MISO and PJM when available, and the continued use of fueled thermal generators as reliability assets even as their energy output declines with higher renewable penetration,” the report noted.

Other potential resources cited in the report include “green hydrogen,” nuclear fission reactors, utility-scale solar, onshore wind and four-hour lithium-ion batteries.

The CRGA, which passed the state legislature in October and the governor said he will sign, creates a new incentive structure for energy storage projects similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power.

Data centers and advocate response

The advocates behind CRGA say it was passed in large part because lawmakers understood the trends that were outlined in this week’s report. But renewable energy advocates like the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and consumer advocates like the CUB say it’s just as essential to regulate power-hungry data centers.

“The next critical step is to pass commonsense guardrails for data centers — the primary driver of the unprecedented energy demand that is saddling Illinois consumers with rising utility bills while dirty energy companies make record profits,” the Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement.

The influential coalition, which includes union, faith and environmental groups, said it will work with lawmakers “to ensure data center developers, not Illinois consumers, pay for the disproportionate energy burden big tech is bringing to our power grid.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t directly respond to questions about what data center regulations, if any, the governor and lawmakers will consider in the spring.

Illinois has provided tax incentives for data centers since Pritzker signed bipartisan legislation in 2019. According to the state’s 2024 report, 27 data centers had received incentives totaling $983 million in tax breaks and benefits.

The National Resources Defense Council estimated data centers will drive up costs for PJM consumers by another $163 billion through 2033 and increase monthly bills by about $70 by 2028.

The Citizens Utility Board called on PJM to clean up its interconnection queue while urging states to force data centers to reduce operations or use on-site backup battery systems when electricity is in high demand. Advocates also called for the renewal of a proposal requiring data centers to power themselves with renewable energy, which stalled in the spring.

“Data center companies are among the wealthiest in the world, and it is simply unconscionable that customers should pay unbearably high power costs to foot the bill for data center energy guzzling,” Moskowitz said.

The Manufacturers’ Association have long called for a repeal of CEJA’s closure date to reduce uncertainty. The group called for an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes keeping fossil duels online.

“If skyrocketing power bills were not warning enough, this new report is a flashing red sign that Illinois needs to act immediately,” Denzler said in a statement. “With electricity demand only expected to increase, we simply cannot risk the chaos that would be caused by the premature closure of baseload generation plants as required under current law.”

Gathered in a room, they pored over maps and hydrologic data in an effort to craft an agreement that would keep the American West growing and end the perpetual fighting surrounding the river’s use.

They knew the stakes: The river tied the region together, but the water that flowed through it had already been promised to more people than it could sustain. People relied on the river to build their lives, but the water was not always reliable.

A century later, the Colorado River is even more important to the surrounding region — but the demands on it are greater, too. More than 40 million people rely on this river. Families, farms, tribes and cities depend on it for the water security that drives their communities and economies — as do the fish, wildlife and ecosystems that call it home.

The river built the West — and the river will shape its future.

That is why the current round of negotiations for the Colorado River carries such weight. Just like that group gathered back in 1922 in Santa Fe, each of the seven Basin states has sent commissioners who understand the scale of the task before them. It’s no secret that their work is difficult and often thankless. We respect their efforts and want them to succeed.

As the senior senators from Utah and New Mexico, we both believe that the best outcome remains a seven-state agreement that keeps the system stable while respecting the law that governs it. Reaching that outcome requires understanding how the river functions in the places where it begins.

Our states sit in the part of the Basin where water use rises and falls with the river itself. Communities in the Upper Basin plan for the water that arrives, not the water they wish for. When there is less snowpack, water use falls. When streams shrink, fields and habitats dry. Families adjust, towns adapt and communities make do.

Recent commentary has overlooked that reality. Some officials have questioned the sincerity of Upper Basin proposals. Others have accused the Upper Basin states of taking “extreme” positions or refusing to make reductions. These arguments ignore our contributions. They distract from the legal framework that governs the Basin and from the hard, practical decisions required to reach a lasting agreement.

The path forward begins with the commitments states already made and Congress has already approved. It also includes managing the Colorado River within its actual limits, guided by obligations that are clear and enforceable.

The Upper Basin has met its delivery obligations under the 1922 Compact. The Upper Basin has used less water than the Lower Basin — not because its needs are smaller, but in part because hydrology forces that reality: when less water flows into the system, Upper Basin use typically declines. In contrast, the Lower Basin has typically drawn its full apportionment, even in dry years, while the Upper Basin has absorbed the risk of an unpredictable river.

That is why the Upper Basin states have put forward serious measures to stabilize the river, including significant commitments to water conservation. All seven states face rising demand, but for this negotiation, it is existential. Utah’s population is projected to double by 2065. New Mexico faces steep declines in its available water resources in the decades ahead. Families who will call these communities home have a direct stake in this negotiation. Any agreement must take their future into account.

Congress also has a central role to play. No investment in Basin infrastructure or conservation programs can move forward without congressional appropriations. And no agreement among states requiring additional authority can take effect without Congress’s approval. When Congress approved the original Compact, members believed it would avoid years of litigation and delay. We still believe that is true. We support a seven-state deal. We want a stable, reliable river system. We want to allow Basin states to plan for the future, instead of navigating crisis after crisis.

The commissioners now at the table have an extraordinarily difficult task, and they deserve the chance to succeed. Congress stands ready to do its part. If we approach this negotiation with respect for our neighbors, for the law, the river’s natural limits, and for the communities that depend on it, a fair agreement is within reach.

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, ""we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill's co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure ""gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win'' on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,"" Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy ... expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.""

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,"" said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,"" he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.

Energy Fuels is actively producing separated neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, with commercial validation by major manufacturers including POSCO, and plans to commence commercial production of critical heavy rare earth oxides (dysprosium and terbium) by Q4 2026.

The company's asset base spans uranium mines in the US, heavy mineral sands projects in Australia, Madagascar, and Brazil, creating multiple pathways to production across complementary critical mineral commodities.

As of September 30, 2025, Energy Fuels maintained $298.5 million in working capital, with uranium production trending toward 2+ million pounds annually and substantial finished inventory across uranium, vanadium, and rare earth products.

Why Energy Fuels Merits Investor Attention

In an era defined by energy transition, national security concerns, and supply chain resilience, Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU, TSX: EFR) has positioned itself at the intersection of multiple strategic commodity themes. The Denver-based company represents one of the few vertically integrated critical minerals producers in North America, with operating assets spanning uranium production, rare earth element processing, and heavy mineral sands development.

The company's transformation goes beyond uranium production to become what management describes as ""a globally significant critical mineral company based in the US."" This evolution comes as Western governments actively seek to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earth supply chains and rebuild domestic uranium production capacity. What distinguishes Energy Fuels from exploration-stage competitors is its operational status, with the White Mesa Mill processing uranium-bearing materials for over four decades and recently adding commercial rare earth oxide separation capabilities.

Company Overview: A Diversified Critical Minerals Platform

Energy Fuels operates a portfolio spanning three primary commodity groups: uranium and vanadium, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands containing titanium and zirconium minerals. The operational foundation rests on the White Mesa Mill, which management characterizes as the only operating conventional uranium mill in the USA and the only US facility able to process monazite for rare earth oxide production.

Current uranium operations include two producing mines: the Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona, potentially the highest-grade uranium mine in US history, and the La Sal Complex in Utah, comprising several mines along an 11-mile trend. These operations generated sales of 240,000 pounds of U3O8 at a realized price of $72.38 per pound during the third quarter of 2025.

The development pipeline includes three large-scale uranium projects with combined resources approaching 70 million pounds: Sheep Mountain in Wyoming (fully permitted), Roca Honda in New Mexico (designated as a ""Fast-41 Covered Project"" by the Trump Administration), and Bullfrog in Utah (pre-permitting stage). The company also maintains the Nichols Ranch in-situ recovery operation in Wyoming on standby.

Strategic Rare Earth Initiative: Capturing Value in Critical Magnets

Energy Fuels' most transformative initiative involves rare earth elements, particularly magnetic rare earths essential for electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and defense applications. The company's approach centers on processing monazite, a mineral concentrate containing 50-60% total rare earth oxides with higher concentrations of valuable neodymium, praseodymium, and heavy rare earths compared to other feedstocks.

The White Mesa Mill currently operates Phase 1A rare earth processing with capacity to handle up to 10,000 tonnes per annum of monazite, producing up to 1,000 tonnes annually of separated NdPr oxide. The company has achieved commercial validation, with the corporate presentation confirming qualification by POSCO and production of commercial-scale rare earth permanent magnets.

""Energy Fuels' White Mesa Mill is the only U.S. facility with the commercial capacity to process monazite for production of high-purity 'light' and 'heavy' REE oxides.""

The company is actively piloting separation of heavy rare earth oxides, having produced approximately 29 kilograms of dysprosium oxide at 99.9% purity through September 2025, with 1 kilogram of terbium oxide expected in December 2025. Management plans commercial US production of heavy REE oxides as early as Q4 2026 for dysprosium, terbium, and potentially samarium oxides. At October 31, 2025 pricing, NdPr oxide trades at $87,500 per tonne, dysprosium oxide at $850,000 per tonne in Europe, and terbium oxide at $3.6 million per tonne in Europe.

Phase 2 Expansion: Scaling Production Capacity

Energy Fuels' most significant near-term catalyst is the planned Phase 2 expansion of rare earth processing capacity at the White Mesa Mill. The company expects to release a feasibility study for this expansion before year-end 2025, detailing plans for dedicated monazite crack and leach circuits for simultaneous production of REE oxides plus U3O8.

The Phase 2 configuration targets annual production capacity of up to 6,000 tonnes of NdPr oxide, 275 tonnes of dysprosium oxide, 80 tonnes of terbium oxide, and potentially other rare earth oxides based on customer requirements. At current market prices, this production profile would generate approximately $986 million in annual revenue from rare earth oxides alone. The company has initiated permitting for Phase 2 with planned commissioning in 2028.

Financing for this expansion received a significant boost in October 2025 when Energy Fuels successfully closed a $700 million convertible senior notes offering, oversubscribed by more than 7x with favorable terms including a 0.75% annual coupon rate, 32.5% conversion premium ($20.34 per share), and capped call features effectively increasing the conversion price to $30.70 per share. The net proceeds of approximately $625 million are earmarked for White Mesa Mill Phase 2 expansion and Donald Project development.

Securing Monazite Feedstock: The Heavy Mineral Sands Strategy

Energy Fuels' rare earth production strategy relies on securing reliable supplies of monazite concentrate sourced as a byproduct from heavy mineral sands mining operations. The company emphasizes that importing high-grade monazite sand byproduct from HMS mines globally is a lower-cost way to produce separated REE oxides versus primary REE production.

The most advanced HMS-sourced monazite supply comes from the Donald Project in Australia, where Energy Fuels is earning up to a 49% joint venture interest with Astron Corporation while securing 100% of the monazite produced. The Donald Project has received conditional support of A$80 million in development financing from Export Finance Australia, with total project funding estimated at A$520 million. Management expects a final investment decision as early as Q1 2026 with potential monazite deliveries to White Mesa Mill by late 2027. The Donald Project is particularly valuable for its exceptional levels of heavy REE oxides, including dysprosium, terbium, and samarium.

Energy Fuels also controls the Toliara Project in Madagascar, considered one of the best HMS development opportunities globally with additional valuable REE monazite byproduct. The project features a 38-year mine life with significant expansion potential, though recent political unrest requires monitoring. An updated feasibility study is expected before year-end 2025.

The company's third HMS project, Bahia in Brazil, is 100%-owned with sonic drilling underway and a resource estimate expected in 2025. Bahia could potentially supply 3,000-5,000 tonnes per annum of monazite to White Mesa Mill for decades, translating to roughly 300-500 tonnes annually of NdPr oxide plus dysprosium and terbium. Energy Fuels also maintains a current offtake agreement with Chemours Company, expected to deliver 500-2,000+ tonnes per annum of monazite.

Uranium Business: Foundation of Cash Generation

While rare earth elements represent Energy Fuels' highest-growth opportunity, the uranium business provides near-term cash generation supporting company operations. The September 30, 2025 financial update shows uranium sales of 240,000 pounds at an average realized price of $72.38 per pound during Q3 2025, with contract deliveries of 300,000 pounds planned for full-year 2025, increasing to 620,000-880,000 pounds in 2026.

The Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona represents Energy Fuels' highest-grade uranium asset, with management expecting to mine over 2 million pounds of U3O8 in 2026 at costs of approximately $23-30 per pound. The presentation notes substantial potential growth in resources, suggesting multi-year production potential. The La Sal Complex in Utah is actively mining and shipping ore to the mill for processing and sale in 2025 and beyond.

Energy Fuels has secured four long-term uranium sales contracts featuring fixed and market price components, floors and ceilings, and inflation escalation, with deliveries scheduled from 2025 through 2030. The company emphasizes its status as a trusted partner for US nuclear utilities. Cost-of-goods sold on U3O8 sales should trend lower starting in Q1 2026 as low-cost Pinyon Plain ore is processed, suggesting improving margins ahead.

Financial Position & Operational Metrics

Energy Fuels entered the fourth quarter of 2025 from a position of financial strength, reporting $298.5 million in working capital as of September 30, 2025, before adding the approximately $625 million in net proceeds from the October convertible notes offering. Total assets reached $758.3 million as of quarter-end.

Inventory positions as of September 30 included 485,000 pounds of finished U3O8, 1.62 million pounds of uranium in stockpile and work-in-progress, 905,000 pounds of finished vanadium pentoxide, 37,000 kilograms of finished separated NdPr oxide, and 9,000 kilograms of finished high-purity, partially separated mixed rare earth elements. The company calculated its finished product inventory worth approximately $45.3 million at current commodity prices.

Operational guidance indicates uranium production trending toward 2+ million pounds U3O8 per year currently, with potential to scale to 4-6 million pounds annually as development projects advance. For Q4 2025, management expected contract sales of 160,000 pounds of U3O8 with potential for additional spot market sales.

Investment Thesis for Energy Fuels

Phase 2 expansion could deliver $986 million annual REE revenue by 2029 at current prices, with capital funding secured through October 2025 convertible notes offering.

Low-cost Pinyon Plain ore ($23-30/lb production cost) entering mill feed starting Q1 2026 should drive improving COGS against long-term contract prices with floors, ceilings, and inflation escalation through 2030.

Donald FID expected Q1 2026 and Toliara feasibility before year-end 2025 provide multiple pathways to secure 40,000+ tonnes annual monazite feedstock by late 2020s.

US-based rare earth separation and uranium production directly address Department of Defense supply chain priorities, creating potential for government offtake agreements or production incentives.

Combined $900+ million liquidity provides financial runway through multiple development phases without near-term dilution risk given capped call structure.

Exposure to uranium, magnetic rare earths, heavy rare earths, titanium, and zirconium reduces single-commodity price risk while capturing thematic premium across energy transition and defense manufacturing.

Energy Fuels presents a multifaceted investment case centered on domestic critical mineral production at a time of heightened policy support and structural supply chain reconfiguration. The company has successfully transitioned from uranium-only producer to diversified critical minerals platform while maintaining the financial resources to execute its development pipeline through the secured $700 million convertible debt financing.

The investment thesis rests on three pillars: near-term uranium cash generation at improving margins as low-cost Pinyon Plain ore flows through the mill; commercial rare earth oxide production scaling from 1,000 tonnes NdPr annually today to 6,000+ tonnes by 2028-2029, supplemented by high-value heavy rare earth production; and optionality on heavy mineral sands projects that could secure decades of monazite feedstock while generating additional revenue from titanium and zirconium products.

Investors should monitor several key catalysts in coming quarters: Phase 2 feasibility study release before year-end 2025, Donald FID and financing announcement in Q1 2026, Toliara feasibility study and FID timing, heavy rare earth commercial production commencement in Q4 2026, and uranium production trends as Pinyon Plain ramps toward 2+ million pounds annually. The stock's performance will likely track progress on these milestones alongside broader uranium and rare earth price trends, with particular sensitivity to any US government policy initiatives supporting domestic critical mineral supply chains.

TL;DR

Energy Fuels operates the only US facility producing both uranium and separated rare earth oxides, with $900+ million in liquidity to fund White Mesa Mill Phase 2 expansion (6,000 tpa NdPr capacity by 2028) and Donald HMS project development. Uranium production approaches 2 million pounds annually at improving margins, while rare earth business scales from current 1,000 tpa NdPr to add heavy rare earths (Dy/Tb) by Q4 2026. Three HMS projects (Donald, Toliara, Bahia) provide pathway to 40,000+ tpa monazite feedstock securing long-term rare earth production. Strong policy alignment with US government critical mineral supply chain priorities. Key near-term catalysts include Phase 2 feasibility (before YE 2025), Donald FID (Q1 2026), and heavy REE commercialization (Q4 2026).

The decision follows reports that Energy Transfer was planning to make the final investment decision on the Lake Charles LNG project by the end of this year. Lake Charles LNG was fully permitted, it was going to use existing infrastructure, and was expected to benefit from an abundant natural gas supply through existing connections to the Henry Hub and connectivity to Energy Transfer’s vast network of natural gas pipelines, the company said earlier this year.

On top of that, Energy Transfer had struck several offtake deals for future supply from Lake Charles, including with Chevron, which had committed to 3 million tons of LNG from the facility, and Japan’s Kyushu Electric Power Company, for 1 million tons of LNG.

However, Energy Transfer needed more partners to share the financial load with, as noted during its third-quarter earnings call. At the time, Energy Transfer said it was looking for buyers for up to 80% of the project’s equity before the final investment decision was made.

“We are in advanced discussions with MidOcean Energy related to its participation as a 30% equity owner of Lake Charles LNG with a commensurate percentage of LNG offtake,” co-chief executive Thomas Long reported during the company’s earnings call in early November. “We're in discussions with other parties for the remaining equity we intend to sell in order to reduce Energy Transfer's equity interest to 20%.”

The decision to drop the project reflects a growing fear in the industry that there is too much new LNG capacity coming in the near future, which would pressure prices and squeeze profitability. Energy Transfer was also challenged by rising costs, which is quite usual for LNG projects. Reuters quoted one unnamed source as saying that Energy Transfer’s management had also gotten nervous about venturing into a new space, LNG, when the company was, above all, a pipeline player.

It's the latest climate-related move by President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, cut funding for climate research, and removed climate and weather scientists from their posts across the federal government. During his first term, Trump famously contradicted the nation's weather forecasting service by redrawing a Hurricane Dorian's path on a map with a Sharpie.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, in a post Tuesday on X, announced the plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, calling it ""one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country."" NCAR was founded more than six decades ago to provide universities with expertise and resources for collaborative research on global weather, water, and climate challenges.

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""

Antonio Busalacchi, who heads the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a nonprofit consortium of 129 U.S. universities that oversees the Boulder facility, told NPR he received no prior notice before the announcement and believes the decision ""is entirely political.""

NCAR's job is to study both climate and weather, and Busalacchi says the two cannot be understood separately. ""Our job is to state what the science is, and it's for others to interpret what the significance of that science is,"" he says. ""We're very careful not to cross over that line to advocacy or policy prescription.""

Plan faces a political backlash

Vought's announcement drew an immediate response from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, who said in a statement that if the White House goes ahead with the plan, ""public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.""

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship by the White House in response to Colorado's refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a former Mesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing voting machines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump, a largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

""The judgement is that this is very much about Tina Peters,"" Bennet told local media in Colorado. And that the president attempted to get his way through intimidation and he hasn't gotten his way and he is trying to punish Colorado as a result."" In a joint statement, Bennett, Neguse and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper called the administration's plan ""deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory.""

NPR reached out to Vought's Office of Management and Budget, but received no response. The White House press office did not answer specific questions, including one asking if ""breaking up"" NCAR meant it would be closed. But in a statement, the White House said ""NCAR's activities veer far from strong or useful science,"" adding that the center was being dismantled ""to eliminate Green New Scam research activities.""

American Meteorological Society President David Stensrud says he has used NCAR weather models throughout his career. ""I think the work that I and others have done have led to the improvements that we see [in] … weather predictions,"" he says. ""Losing that [will cause] a great deal of hurt in terms of our ability to continue to improve forecasts and the future.""

The ""beating heart"" of climate and weather science

Among NCAR's many contributions, in the 1960s, it developed dropsondes — tube-shaped instruments released from aircraft, including hurricane hunters, to measure temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. In the 1980s, the center helped develop and refine technology to monitor wind shear at airports.

Busalacchi says these efforts have contributed to decades without passenger plane crashes caused by wind shear or downbursts. ""We've had zero loss of life from these weather events that can be directly attributed to our research. And that's what we're talking about losing"" if NCAR shuts down, he says.

NCAR, which employs about 830 people, is also known for developing and maintaining tools such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), which is used around the world to predict everything from thunderstorms to large-scale systems, including hurricanes and frontal systems. NCAR's Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) is also widely used by scientists, including Jason Furtado, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.

Furtado says he and his colleagues have used the model to run experiments ""to look for where in the atmosphere and ocean we get long-range signals for extreme cold air outbreaks"" such as the February 2021 event that hit the midsection of the country, resulting in sub-zero temperatures for days and the total breakdown of the electrical grid in central Texas. ""We've used [CESM] and come up with some really important research,"" Furtado says.

He calls NCAR ""a world-envied research center for atmospheric science"" and ""a beating heart for the atmospheric science community."" He says his research and that of many other scientists would simply not be possible without the Boulder center. ""In some way every atmospheric scientist has a connection to NCAR, whether they've directly been to the building or they have not,"" he says.

Ken Davis, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State, did research at NCAR from the time he was a graduate student until after his postdoc. He says NCAR plays a critical role in providing its members with cutting-edge computing resources, observational resources and scientific expertise ""which no university can provide on its own.""

""If any investigator anywhere in the country wants to request a research aircraft … NCAR will take a look at that proposal and say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' "" Davis says. ""As a university investigator, I can show up with an instrumented C-130 [aircraft] to do a whole bunch of airborne research, which would be totally impossible without this facility to support the community.""

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community. In April, the administration dismissed scientists working on the country's flagship climate report and then removed the report from a government website.

In 2019, Trump landed himself in a scandal known as ""Sharpiegate,"" in which he contradicted official National Weather Service forecasts for Hurricane Dorian by insisting the storm directly threatened Alabama. He later displayed an Oval Office map showing an altered storm path that appeared to have been drawn with a black marker. Earlier this year, the Senate approved the nomination of Neil Jacobs, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official cited for misconduct related to the episode, to lead the agency.

In its 2026 budget plan, the White House has also proposed cutting NOAA's budget by about 27% and eliminating NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's core climate and weather research branch. The administration has also rolled back National Science Foundation funding for climate science.

Ultimately, closing NCAR wouldn't have an immediate impact on weather forecasting, Furtado says. Instead, he says, it would slowly erode the scientific community's ability to make further progress on understanding weather and climate.

""We can either accept the facts and work on ways to mitigate and adapt, or ignore the data and not be ready for the changing world we have,"" Furtado says.

Colder temperatures create more power demand, and natural gas prices tend to increase when utilities need more fuel to increase their generation.","Prices have steadily risen for natural gas throughout 2025, for residents and industry alike, and Louisiana finds itself at the center of the boom. A nation-leading three liquified natural gas export facilities operate along its coast, and five more are in the construction or planning phases.

But more LNG exports will mean higher domestic utility prices, according to a new report from the consumer advocacy group, Public Citizen.

Public Citizen analyzed documents from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and determined natural gas prices are increasing for American households as gas companies in the U.S. export more of the commodity to meet global demand.

From January through September, Americans paid $12 billion more for natural gas than the same period last year. That comes to about $124 per family in higher utility bills, a 22% increase directly related to higher natural gas prices, the report notes.

Natural gas prices for consumers are expected to increase another 16% in 2026, according to Public Citizen, which cited U.S. Energy Information Administration predictions.

Analysts attribute growing global demand for natural gas to political, industrial and environmental factors.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led other countries, mostly European, to seek other sources of the fuel, which is widely preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal.

The rise of artificial intelligence has caused a surge in the construction of data centers that require vast amounts of electricity that is most likely to come from power plants that run on natural gas.

An LSU Center for Energy Studies outlook for 2026 credits much of the state’s growth in natural gas exports to executive orders from the Trump administration that lifted a Biden-era moratorium on expansion of LNG export facilities.

The United States exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG around the globe in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Louisiana handled around 61% of those shipments.

LNG exports are expected to “more than double by 2037, with nearly all new export capacity located on the Gulf Coast,” according to the LSU report’s analysis of Energy Information Administration predictions.

“As we continue to see more production, more capacity for exports, particularly in the LNG space, that’s going to mean more jobs,” said Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. “Somebody is going to supply that gas. Louisiana gets to benefit from the investments in the export capacity.”

But with increased exports comes the tradeoff of higher domestic prices for residents, according to the Public Citizen report.

The majority of Louisiana’s electricity, around 70%, is generated from natural gas, according to the most recent numbers from the Energy Information Administration. It costs about 12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity for residential, natural gas-fueled power in Louisiana, compared with the 18-cent national average.

Utilities pass along the increased cost of electricity generation to their customers, often through what’s called a fuel adjustment charge on their utility bills. They also include charges to recoup the costs of any losses or investments such as new power lines or infrastructure upgrades. Although Louisiana has low rates for its electricity, it hasn’t translated to low power bills because of these pass-along costs to customers.

“Whatever amount of gas they’re using to generate the electricity that’s being used in your home, the cost of that gas is being charged directly to you,” said Jesse George, policy lead for the Alliance for Affordable Energy.

In some areas such as New Orleans, an area with older, less energy-efficient homes, residents will feel the higher prices in 2026, George said.

Colder temperatures create more power demand, and natural gas prices tend to increase when utilities need more fuel to increase their generation. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 22% increase in natural gas prices for the winter heating season that runs through March.

Though heightened winter electricity demand in Louisiana typically ends by March, customers could see additional fuel surcharges on their utility bills for months if there is a severe cold snap. The same situation arises during intense summer heat,

“About 20% of households cannot pay their utility bills already,” George said, citing the most recent numbers available from Entergy New Orleans’ disconnection rates. “Couple that with these increased fuel prices, and that certainly will only exacerbate the problems and the challenges that people are facing already.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9287-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 15:01:41.637558

Once operational, this data center will play a vital role in supporting our technologies and accelerating our progress toward personal superintelligence. Today, we’re excited to share updates on the investments we’ve made as a positive member of the Richland Parish community.

Creating Local Economic Impact

When we began construction, we committed to supporting the local economy by partnering with regional businesses and sourcing labor and materials locally. Over the last year alone, we’ve contracted more than $875 million with Louisiana businesses, driving local economic growth and supporting job creation. The buildout of the Richland Parish Data Center is led by three general contractors — Turner Construction Company, DPR Construction, and Mortensen Construction — which have been instrumental in hiring skilled trade workers across our four million square-foot campus and engaging with local businesses.

We’re proud to work with more than 160 Louisiana businesses (84% of which are local to Northeast Louisiana) that support the data center’s construction with electric, paving, utility work and more, as well as dozens of local food vendors who provide daily meals on site. We expect our construction team’s partnerships with local businesses to grow as part of our multi-billion-dollar investment in the State of Louisiana. To date, we have supported 3,700 construction workers and expect to reach a peak workforce of 5,000 by June 2026. Once completed, the data center will support more than 500 operational jobs like electricians, HVAC specialists, server and network techs, safety and security experts, and engineers.

“Meta’s decision to invest here has done more than bring a world-class project to Louisiana — it is activating entire ecosystems. Over the past year, we’ve seen local contractors, technology firms, and service providers across the state expand their teams and capabilities to support this project. That’s what progress looks like. Projects lifting entire communities and sectors, and reinforcing that Louisiana is a place where companies big and small can grow together,” said Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois.

Prioritizing Energy and Water Efficiency

We’re proud to call the communities in which we have data centers home, and beyond supporting jobs and businesses there, we strive to be good neighbors. Across all of our data centers, we work closely with the local electric utility to plan for and meet our energy needs and ensure we pay for the energy and related infrastructure we use so that other customers’ electricity bills don’t increase as a result of our data center. In Louisiana, we worked closely with Entergy to provide additional protection for customers, which projects that the electricity payments for the Richland Parish Data Center will cut both grid upgrade customer costs and storm charges by about 10%, resulting in $650 million in customer savings over 15 years. We are also contributing $15 million to Entergy’s customer assistance program, which provides bill payment assistance to low-income customers. As part of our broader work to add new energy to the local grid we are supporting three new clean energy projects in Louisiana, and additional projects will be announced as the data center gets closer to operation.

We are also driving water efficiency in our data center operations and investing in local water restoration projects that will return 100% of the Richland Parish Data Center’s water consumption to the Boeuf, Tensas, and Lower Mississippi watersheds. In 2025, we expanded our partnerships with Resource Environmental Solutions and Ducks Unlimited to support five water restoration projects restoring degraded wetlands, improving water quality, and enhancing ecosystems.

Investing in the Communities Where We Operate

In the area surrounding the Richland Parish Data Center, we’re expanding our investment to more than $300 million to help improve local infrastructure including roads, water, and wastewater systems. In partnership with the Richland Revitalization Board, we’re also committing $300,000 to support projects in Richland Parish’s three municipalities — Rayville, Delhi, and Mangham — that are focused on improving public parks and restoring the parish’s most iconic establishments.

In addition, we’re supporting senior services at the Richland Voluntary Council on Aging, facility upgrades at the Northeast Louisiana Veteran’s Cemetery, the robotics program at the Delhi Charter School, and mixed reality workforce development at the Richland Parish Schools.

It's the latest climate-related move by President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, cut funding for climate research, and removed climate and weather scientists from their posts across the federal government. During his first term, Trump famously contradicted the nation's weather forecasting service by redrawing a Hurricane Dorian's path on a map with a Sharpie.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, in a post Tuesday on X, announced the plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, calling it ""one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country."" NCAR was founded more than six decades ago to provide universities with expertise and resources for collaborative research on global weather, water, and climate challenges.

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""

Antonio Busalacchi, who heads the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a nonprofit consortium of 129 U.S. universities that oversees the Boulder facility, told NPR he received no prior notice before the announcement and believes the decision ""is entirely political.""

NCAR's job is to study both climate and weather, and Busalacchi says the two cannot be understood separately. ""Our job is to state what the science is, and it's for others to interpret what the significance of that science is,"" he says. ""We're very careful not to cross over that line to advocacy or policy prescription.""

Plan faces a political backlash

Vought's announcement drew an immediate response from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, who said in a statement that if the White House goes ahead with the plan, ""public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.""

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship by the White House in response to Colorado's refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a former Mesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing voting machines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump, a largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

""The judgement is that this is very much about Tina Peters,"" Bennet told local media in Colorado. And that the president attempted to get his way through intimidation and he hasn't gotten his way and he is trying to punish Colorado as a result."" In a joint statement, Bennett, Neguse and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper called the administration's plan ""deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory.""

NPR reached out to Vought's Office of Management and Budget, but received no response. The White House press office did not answer specific questions, including one asking if ""breaking up"" NCAR meant it would be closed. But in a statement, the White House said ""NCAR's activities veer far from strong or useful science,"" adding that the center was being dismantled ""to eliminate Green New Scam research activities.""

American Meteorological Society President David Stensrud says he has used NCAR weather models throughout his career. ""I think the work that I and others have done have led to the improvements that we see [in] … weather predictions,"" he says. ""Losing that [will cause] a great deal of hurt in terms of our ability to continue to improve forecasts and the future.""

The ""beating heart"" of climate and weather science

Among NCAR's many contributions, in the 1960s, it developed dropsondes — tube-shaped instruments released from aircraft, including hurricane hunters, to measure temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. In the 1980s, the center helped develop and refine technology to monitor wind shear at airports.

Busalacchi says these efforts have contributed to decades without passenger plane crashes caused by wind shear or downbursts. ""We've had zero loss of life from these weather events that can be directly attributed to our research. And that's what we're talking about losing"" if NCAR shuts down, he says.

NCAR, which employs about 830 people, is also known for developing and maintaining tools such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), which is used around the world to predict everything from thunderstorms to large-scale systems, including hurricanes and frontal systems. NCAR's Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) is also widely used by scientists, including Jason Furtado, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.

Furtado says he and his colleagues have used the model to run experiments ""to look for where in the atmosphere and ocean we get long-range signals for extreme cold air outbreaks"" such as the February 2021 event that hit the midsection of the country, resulting in sub-zero temperatures for days and the total breakdown of the electrical grid in central Texas. ""We've used [CESM] and come up with some really important research,"" Furtado says.

He calls NCAR ""a world-envied research center for atmospheric science"" and ""a beating heart for the atmospheric science community."" He says his research and that of many other scientists would simply not be possible without the Boulder center. ""In some way every atmospheric scientist has a connection to NCAR, whether they've directly been to the building or they have not,"" he says.

Ken Davis, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State, did research at NCAR from the time he was a graduate student until after his postdoc. He says NCAR plays a critical role in providing its members with cutting-edge computing resources, observational resources and scientific expertise ""which no university can provide on its own.""

""If any investigator anywhere in the country wants to request a research aircraft … NCAR will take a look at that proposal and say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' "" Davis says. ""As a university investigator, I can show up with an instrumented C-130 [aircraft] to do a whole bunch of airborne research, which would be totally impossible without this facility to support the community.""

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community. In April, the administration dismissed scientists working on the country's flagship climate report and then removed the report from a government website.

In 2019, Trump landed himself in a scandal known as ""Sharpiegate,"" in which he contradicted official National Weather Service forecasts for Hurricane Dorian by insisting the storm directly threatened Alabama. He later displayed an Oval Office map showing an altered storm path that appeared to have been drawn with a black marker. Earlier this year, the Senate approved the nomination of Neil Jacobs, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official cited for misconduct related to the episode, to lead the agency.

In its 2026 budget plan, the White House has also proposed cutting NOAA's budget by about 27% and eliminating NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's core climate and weather research branch. The administration has also rolled back National Science Foundation funding for climate science.

Ultimately, closing NCAR wouldn't have an immediate impact on weather forecasting, Furtado says. Instead, he says, it would slowly erode the scientific community's ability to make further progress on understanding weather and climate.

""We can either accept the facts and work on ways to mitigate and adapt, or ignore the data and not be ready for the changing world we have,"" Furtado says.

""Having less accurate forecasts and being more in the dark about what is coming puts lives and property at risk,"" he says.

This critical piece of legislation represents a significant step toward modernizing the nation’s outdated and cumbersome environmental review process.

The Detroit Regional Chamber has long advocated for comprehensive permitting reform to address the delays that frequently hinder the development of vital infrastructure and energy projects. The current National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process has evolved into a complex hurdle that increases costs and creates uncertainty for businesses.

Under existing standards, complex energy projects often require environmental impact statements that typically take more than two years to complete, with many stretching far longer. Furthermore, the current six-year statute of limitations for legal challenges leaves projects vulnerable to perpetual litigation risk, thereby stalling private sector investment. By streamlining these reviews, the SPEED Act will help the Region remain competitive in a global economy that demands agility and reliable energy.

The SPEED Act provides essential “rules of the road” by clarifying that NEPA is a purely procedural statute intended to ensure agencies consider environmental impacts without mandating specific outcomes or conferring substantive rights. It further modernizes the process by allowing the reuse of previous environmental analyses for up to 10 years.

Key provisions of the legislation include:

Codifying judicial rulings that limit environmental reviews to direct, proximately caused impacts rather than speculative, attenuated, or future effects.

Establishing strict deadlines for final agency actions, requiring decisions within 30 days of completing environmental assessments or impact statements.

Limiting the window for judicial challenges to 150 days, down from the current six-year statute of limitations, to provide project sponsors with immediate certainty.

Narrowing the definition of “major federal action” so that the mere allocation of federal funds, grants, or loans does not automatically trigger an exhaustive and unnecessary NEPA review.

Prohibiting agencies from delaying documents to await new research that was not available at the time of the initial application or notice of intent.

The bill passed the House with a vote of 221 to 196. The Chamber extends its gratitude to the members of the Michigan delegation who supported this common-sense reform, recognizing that project certainty is essential for regional economic growth.

The focus now shifts to the U.S. Senate. The Chamber urges Sens. Gary Peters (D-MI) and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) to support the speedy passage of the SPEED Act, ensuring that the state can efficiently build the necessary infrastructure for the 21st century.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday ordered the PJM Interconnection to develop rules for colocating data centers and other large loads at power plants.

The decision is a “major victory” for companies that own gas-fired and nuclear power plants in PJM, according to analysts with Capstone, a research firm. Some of those companies include Constellation Energy, Public Service Enterprise Group and Vistra.

“We view this order as a strong signal of FERC’s position on the data center vs. affordability narrative, with the commission, rather than impeding AI development, likely to focus on avenues for relief for rising electricity costs, such as changes to capacity accreditation, fast-tracking new, high-capacity resources, and transferring costs from load to renewable generators,” Josh Price, Capstone director, and Hannah Rogers, senior associate, said in a client note.

Trade groups for independent power producers and clean energy welcomed the order.

FERC’s order is a “first step in a process that will require quick action and durable consensus from many stakeholders and highlights the urgency in getting solutions onto the system,” Electric Power Supply Association President and CEO Todd Snitchler said in a statement.

The decision could lead to regulatory certainty for large load customers and safeguards to make sure that colocating loads won’t drive up electric rates for other ratepayers or hurt system reliability, according to Advanced Energy United, a clean energy trade group.

In its decision, FERC directed PJM to create three transmission services that reflect that transmission customers taking service on behalf of colocated loads can and will limit their energy withdrawals from the transmission system under certain conditions, FERC staff said in a presentation on the decision.

The new services are for interim, non-firm transmission; firm contract demand transmission; and non-firm contract demand transmission. FERC gave PJM 60 days to propose those services as part of a “paper hearing” process.

During that process, FERC will consider whether colocated load should be assessed a minimum charge to cover the costs of maintaining the transmission system.

FERC also said PJM must revise its behind-the-meter generation rules and develop a transition process for transitioning to new rules.

To address concerns about power supply in PJM, FERC gave the grid operator until Jan. 19 to file a report on the status of proposals PJM considered in its Critical Issue Fast Path stakeholder process on integrating large loads, including the status of the grid operator’s expedited interconnection process for shovel-ready generation projects.

“Beyond this proceeding, I am concerned about PJM’s ability to procure sufficient resources to reliably serve both new and existing load,” FERC Commissioner Judy Chang said in a concurring statement.

Chang emphasized the limits of FERC’s decision, noting that the colocation model the order envisions may not work in states where the local electric utility must serve retail loads.

“Therefore, the broader challenge of reliably, efficiently, and fairly interconnecting large loads and the generation needed to serve them remains before the commission, the states, and industry,” she said.

In its decision, FERC declined to address jurisdictional issues related to interconnecting retail loads served through colocation arrangements.

During FERC’s open meeting Thursday, Chairman Laura Swett addressed the “narrative” that data centers can increase bills for other ratepayers, describing her family’s stress over paying bills during her childhood.

“I don’t want any American family to feel that anxiety because of anything that we do in this building,” she said, “and I pledge to do everything I can to ensure that our progress does not come at the expense of consumers.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_0oX4uYcdz47KJ2g1j2IbAr43_YpDZMbcgiIo00gUtg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ib3BlX0NyZWVrX051Y2xlYXJfR2VuZXJhdGluZ19TdGF0aW9uX2Zyb21fRGVsYXdhcmVfUml2ZXJfTWF5XzIwMTJfMS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-19 16:59:50.489327

The White House press office did not answer specific questions, including one asking if ""breaking up"" NCAR meant it would be closed. But in a statement, the White House said ""NCAR's activities veer far from strong or useful science,"" adding that the center was being dismantled ""to eliminate Green New Scam research activities.""

American Meteorological Society President David Stensrud says he has used NCAR weather models throughout his career. ""I think the work that I and others have done have led to the improvements that we see [in] … weather predictions,"" he says. ""Losing that [will cause] a great deal of hurt in terms of our ability to continue to improve forecasts and the future.""

The ""beating heart"" of climate and weather science

Among NCAR's many contributions, in the 1960s, it developed dropsondes — tube-shaped instruments released from aircraft, including hurricane hunters, to measure temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. In the 1980s, the center helped develop and refine technology to monitor wind shear at airports.

Busalacchi says these efforts have contributed to decades without passenger plane crashes caused by wind shear or downbursts. ""We've had zero loss of life from these weather events that can be directly attributed to our research. And that's what we're talking about losing"" if NCAR shuts down, he says.

NCAR, which employs about 830 people, is also known for developing and maintaining tools such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), which is used around the world to predict everything from thunderstorms to large-scale systems, including hurricanes and frontal systems. NCAR's Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) is also widely used by scientists, including Jason Furtado, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.

Furtado says he and his colleagues have used the model to run experiments ""to look for where in the atmosphere and ocean we get long-range signals for extreme cold air outbreaks"" such as the February 2021 event that hit the midsection of the country, resulting in sub-zero temperatures for days and the total breakdown of the electrical grid in central Texas. ""We've used [CESM] and come up with some really important research,"" Furtado says.

He calls NCAR ""a world-envied research center for atmospheric science"" and ""a beating heart for the atmospheric science community."" He says his research and that of many other scientists would simply not be possible without the Boulder center. ""In some way every atmospheric scientist has a connection to NCAR, whether they've directly been to the building or they have not,"" he says.

Ken Davis, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State, did research at NCAR from the time he was a graduate student until after his postdoc. He says NCAR plays a critical role in providing its members with cutting-edge computing resources, observational resources and scientific expertise ""which no university can provide on its own.""

""If any investigator anywhere in the country wants to request a research aircraft … NCAR will take a look at that proposal and say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' "" Davis says. ""As a university investigator, I can show up with an instrumented C-130 [aircraft] to do a whole bunch of airborne research, which would be totally impossible without this facility to support the community.""

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community. In April, the administration dismissed scientists working on the country's flagship climate report and then removed the report from a government website.

In 2019, Trump landed himself in a scandal known as ""Sharpiegate,"" in which he contradicted official National Weather Service forecasts for Hurricane Dorian by insisting the storm directly threatened Alabama. He later displayed an Oval Office map showing an altered storm path that appeared to have been drawn with a black marker. Earlier this year, the Senate approved the nomination of Neil Jacobs, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official cited for misconduct related to the episode, to lead the agency.

In its 2026 budget plan, the White House has also proposed cutting NOAA's budget by about 27% and eliminating NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's core climate and weather research branch. The administration has also rolled back National Science Foundation funding for climate science.

Ultimately, closing NCAR wouldn't have an immediate impact on weather forecasting, Furtado says. Instead, he says, it would slowly erode the scientific community's ability to make further progress on understanding weather and climate.

""We can either accept the facts and work on ways to mitigate and adapt, or ignore the data and not be ready for the changing world we have,"" Furtado says.

""Having less accurate forecasts and being more in the dark about what is coming puts lives and property at risk,"" he says.

How the unstoppable electrification revolution has led us to a solar and wind-powered tipping point

Electrification is expanding fast globally, reaching a 'positive tipping point' as it leads towards cleaner air; its benefits becoming self-propelling.

Electrification’s progress stems from the superior environmental footprint of renewables’ infrastructure compared to fossil fuels, alongside declining costs of solar and wind power and increasing electric car sales.

There is still work to realize a clean and inclusive energy transition; accelerating electrification can get us there with investment, international collaboration and community empowerment.

The electrification of our economy and society using renewable power is happening fast. Worldwide, clean electricity from solar and wind plus battery storage (“solar plus”) is becoming the dominant new energy source and is already the cheapest in most countries.

We call this a “positive tipping point.” It is “positive” because electricity from renewables reduces the need to burn greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels and offers benefits such as cleaner air and energy independence.

It is a “tipping point” because once they have crossed key thresholds of affordability, performance and accessibility, the adoption of these technologies can become self-propelling. The more we adopt, the cheaper and better they become due to increasing returns, such as economies of scale and learning-by-doing.

Decades of steady technological improvement and policy planning have led to this relatively abrupt and accelerating solar plus revolution.

The superior physics and economics of clean electricity

The physics and economics of using clean electricity make it a clear winner over fossil fuels for almost all applications.

The energy lost by burning coal, oil or gas to generate electricity or to drive a motor vehicle – due to thermodynamic inefficiency – wastes, on average, about two-thirds (40-80%) of the total primary energy of these fuels, costing around 4.5 trillion dollars per year

.

We burn 16 billion tons of fossil fuels every single year. By contrast, all the materials required to build global solar-plus infrastructure amount to about 1 billion tons. Solar and wind costs have declined by over 80% in the last decade and battery costs by almost 90% since 2010.

As a result, in 2024, over 90% of all new power generation capacity worldwide came from renewables. Every day, more households, businesses and governments are choosing clean electrons over dirty fossil fuels, not just for the climate but because it’s easier, safer and cheaper.

For example, Pakistan has undergone a massive grassroots wave of electrification as farmers and households take advantage of cheap solar imports from China, also due to another important self-propelling feedback in the system – social contagion: the more people see and hear about solar panels in use, the more likely they are to buy them.

In just six years, this additional solar capacity has exceeded the country’s entire grid generation capacity.

This global picture is, however, skewed: China accounted for 65% of this additional capacity. By contrast, Africa, which has 60% of the world’s best solar resources and where 40% of the population (600 million people) lack access to electricity, received less than 2% of global clean energy investment.

Electric vehicles turbocharge the transition to clean mobility

The electrification revolution is also hitting the roads. Electric vehicles have leapt from 2% to 20% of new car sales in just six years as consumers embrace their lower lifetime costs and superior performance. Sales of two and three-wheeled vehicles are also growing exponentially in parts of Asia.

The transformation is also beginning to affect heavy-duty vehicles, led again by China. Thanks to strong policy support and greatly improved battery performance, electric trucks have taken 46% of new sales this year and 60% is expected in 2026.

Every percentage point of EV market share gained equates to lower petrol, diesel and LNG demand, and to lower political influence of petrostates and oil companies, making bolder policies for climate and nature easier to enact.

In line with positive tipping points theory, small group coalitions are best placed to catalyse global change, as leading markets such as China, the European Union and California collaborate to reduce technology costs and set common standards, thereby motivating others to accelerate their own electrification plans.

An ethical and inclusive transition

The clean energy revolution is underway, but it is not yet truly global or inclusive. Many developing nations are keen to leapfrog directly to clean energy, skipping the polluting fossil-fuel phase, for reasons of energy access, health, economic opportunity, diversity and resilience, as well as for climate stability.

This often means securing access to concessional finance, technology partnerships and skills transfers, investing in clean power generation and grid infrastructure, building industrial hubs around renewable power and ensuring that communities have a voice in the decision-making process.

Clean electrification can directly support these goals. Solar and wind projects are being paired with battery systems and mini-grids to bring power to off-grid communities, creating new jobs, diversifying economies previously reliant on commodity exports and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels.

The electrification revolution is here but to accelerate it rapidly and to reach its full potential requires significant intervention in the coming years, including:

Investment: Public, private and blended finance need to direct unprecedented capital into renewable energy generation, battery storage and grid infrastructure. Planning and permitting also need to be streamlined in many jurisdictions to enable solar farms, wind parks and transmission lines to be built in months rather than years.

International collaboration: Climate and energy diplomacy needs to focus on partnerships for transferring clean technology and skills. Wealthier countries, development banks and businesses need to help emerging economies leapfrog to clean electrification.

Community empowerment: Whether it is city authorities procuring electric bus fleets or rural villages building and managing solar plus micro-grids, the electrification revolution will be driven by local action. Policies need to incentivize bottom-up adoption and authorities need to bring people with them in the just transition, including reskilling pathways for fossil fuel industry workers.

While “tipping points” often evoke abrupt, harmful shifts such as coral reef die-off or ocean-circulation collapse, they can also drive rapid positive change. Some are already emerging, such as the accelerating adoption of renewables, electric vehicles and heat pumps; others must be activated quickly to support a safe, just and sustainable future.

Colorado has been working to eliminate almost all of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, based on 2005 pollution levels.
Colorado’s push to use solar, wind and batteries instead of coal to generate electricity was the single most effective strategy in eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, Twyman said.
In the coming years, that sector will replace electricity, which generally has been powered by coal, as the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution.
But if Colorado is serious about its goal of eliminating 100% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, hard choices will need to be made.","The Trump administration’s rollback of policies that improve the climate and protect human health are slowing Colorado’s progress in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and it will be critical for the state to chart its own path to reach its goals, according to state officials who track air pollution and climate change.

Federal repeals of environmental programs and polices are setting the state back about a year in achieving its emissions goals, said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. Colorado is about two years behind schedule in achieving its 2030 benchmark of reducing emissions by 50% from a 2005 baseline. Before Trump took office in January, the state was about one year off target, he said.

The state was supposed to reduce emissions by 26% by 2025, but has eliminated an estimated 21%, Toor said. It’s projected to reach a 46% reduction by 2030.

“What we are seeing is that we still are on a very good trajectory, and while the federal actions do slow things down a little bit, it’s a relatively small impact,” Toor said.

Toor acknowledged that Trump has been in charge for just 11 months, and it’s hard to forecast what else might happen, including a looming battle over the closing of coal-fired power plants in Colorado.

Colorado’s latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report was presented Thursday to the Air Quality Control Commission, a panel appointed by the governor to set rules and regulations to control air pollution.

Overall, Colorado has made progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by creating policies that forced oil and gas companies to lower the amount of methane leaking from wells, a push to use alternative energy sources to power the electrical grid, and regulations that required industrial manufacturers to reduce their pollution.

But the Trump administration’s policies are undoing some of that work.

The Environmental Protection Agency has said it will roll back federal methane rules for the oil and gas industry, although Toor argued those companies still must follow Colorado’s regulations.

The federal government did away with a rule, known as the California waiver, that allowed states to regulate vehicle emissions standards, effectively allowing automakers to produce cars that pollute more. The administration also eliminated funding for solar projects and erased tax incentives that encouraged people to buy electric vehicles.

In Colorado, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled $550 million in funding for clean energy projects, such as $326 million slated for Colorado State University research on reducing methane, a potent planet-warming gas, from oil and gas wells.

All of those moves will hamper Colorado’s efforts to reduce emissions, said Matthew Twyman, a supervisor in the Air Pollution Control Division’s climate change program, during a presentation to the air quality commission Thursday.

Still, the state’s efforts over the past several years are absorbing some of the blow from an administration that denies climate change is real.

“Colorado, in a way, has insulated itself,” Twyman said.

Greenhouse gases such as methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are released through human action and they trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise and impacting Earth’s climate. They also affect people’s health, especially children, the elderly and those who live with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma.

Colorado has been working to eliminate almost all of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, based on 2005 pollution levels. Progress is marked through complex computer modeling systems, and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Air Pollution Control Division is required to report its greenhouse gas progress every two years.

Colorado’s push to use solar, wind and batteries instead of coal to generate electricity was the single most effective strategy in eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, Twyman said.

“That’s true statewide, and that trend is about to drop off a cliff,” he said.

One reason for that slide is that only a few coal-fired power plants continue to operate, so the low-hanging fruit has been plucked, Twyman said.

But Xcel Energy has petitioned to keep a coal plant at its Comanche power station in Pueblo open a year longer than planned, saying it needs to meet growing electricity needs. And Toor said there is concern that the federal government will order the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to keep open its coal-fired plants in Craig, despite plans to shutter its three units by 2028, Toor said.

“It’s not just that it’s going to mean more pollution, but it’s going to be an extra cost for consumers for absolutely no reason,” Toor said. “There’s no need to keep that coal plant open, and it will be very expensive to electric customers across the state.”

But Colorado can control its own destiny.

For example, Gov. Jared Polis is preparing to expand the state’s incentive program for people who buy electric vehicles, said Stefanie Shoup, the deputy director for regulatory affairs at the state’s Air Pollution Control Division. The state earlier this year announced an expansion of its electric vehicle rebate program in the wake of the Republican-controlled Congress eliminating Biden-era tax credits for EV purchases.

Still, the transportation sector — all the cars and trucks on Colorado’s roads — will be a challenge, Twyman said. In the coming years, that sector will replace electricity, which generally has been powered by coal, as the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution.

“It’s very hard to bend 5.5 million people’s choices,” he said. “But it is still bending.”

Agriculture also will move up in the rankings for producing a larger proportion of pollution as other sectors curb emissions, Twyman said. For now, Colorado does not have any policies to regulate emissions from livestock farms or fertilizer applications on crop lands.

“Agriculture is very hard to change,” he said.

But if Colorado is serious about its goal of eliminating 100% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, hard choices will need to be made.

“The easy efforts may be already plucked,” Twyman said. “How you go about decarbonizing is a harder and harder nut to crack.

“The reality is it’s not that easy. It’s not that pretty.”",https://www.timescall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TDP-L-Comanche-coal-RJS-10523.jpg?w=1024&h=727,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:22.508072

New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania are suing the Trump administration over funding for electric vehicle chargers, as part of a coalition of 17 Democratic attorneys general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. They are alleging the White House is acting unlawfully by withholding funds approved by Congress.

“Without any notice or explanation, the United States Department of Transportation just quietly refused to approve any new funding under the programs which had already been appropriated by Congress and awarded to the states,” said New Jersey Attorney General Michael Platkin.

“This is consistent with how this administration has treated congressional appropriations. They’re not optional. They’re laws,” said Platkin. And the Constitution says that only under limited circumstances can the president, after money has been appropriated by Congress and passed into law, can he restrict those funds from going to their intended recipients.”

New Jersey is waiting on $16 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. Both programs are part of the Biden-era bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Congress passed in 2022.

Platkin said the funds would create new jobs and provide EV drivers greater access to the roads.

“At a time, again, when we’re trying to make energy costs go down,” Platkin said. “We’re trying to make people’s lives easier and more affordable. This makes no sense. It’s illegal, but it also just makes no sense.”

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s actions violate the Constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement that the funds would support “EV construction projects in Pennsylvania and … new, good paying jobs.”

“I will not let the federal government break their word at the expense of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said.

Pennsylvania was awarded funds to construct three charging stations along I-78 and I-81. The joint project involving Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia was awarded $18.6 million.

The effort was part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to tackle climate change.

This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the effort. “While the Administration is busy finding ways for their Big Oil donors to profit, California will continue to fight for its people, environment, and innovation.”

The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment.

But President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’s not a fan of electric vehicles. Trump signed a law that ended EV tax credits and recently weakened fuel efficiency standards, saying that Americans prefer gas-powered vehicles.

The full blog series, in addition to their reference reports, can be found at the Superhot Rock Resource Library.

Prior to the advancement of next-generation technologies, geothermal energy was limited to the few, scarce regions around the world with the three necessary components to develop conventional geothermal systems: shallow heat, abundant fluid, and interconnected rock fractures. Under those limitations, geothermal energy has only ever met less than 1% of the global energy demand. However, continued technological improvements could allow geothermal energy to expand geographically and meet as much as 15% of the global electricity demand growth to 2050. The advancements that created this opportunity have been driven by technological improvements including: 1) faster drilling rates and lower drilling costs, 2) higher production temperatures and flow rates, and 3) the development of longer and deeper wells. A key aspect of where next-generation geothermal will be developed in its early stages depends on the geothermal gradient of the region (i.e., how fast temperatures increase with depth below the Earth’s surface). This is because regions with shallow heat require less drilling to get to the same temperature when compared to regions with deeper heat resources. Continued improvements in these areas will be critical to turning this promise into reality—allowing geothermal energy to provide cost competitive clean firm power anywhere it is needed.

But how does this global potential translate to regional potential? In their 2024 article, Power supply characterization of baseload and flexible enhanced geothermal systems, Aljubran and Horne discuss a new temperature-at-depth model for the contiguous United States and use that model to determine the economics of developing enhanced geothermal systems across the contiguous U.S. This work, which I highlight below, showcases the potential cost competitive development of next-generation geothermal across the U.S.

Enhanced geothermal systems could generate more electricity than 300x the 2023 U.S. power consumption

Aljubran and Horne developed the Stanford Thermal Model to estimate the potential of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) across the contiguous U.S. at depths of up to 7 km. To do this, the Stanford Thermal Model estimates temperature-at-depth across the contiguous U.S. and is built on over 400,000 bottomhole temperature measurements in addition to other variables that are key to creating an accurate model of the subsurface. These additional variables include physical quantities such as depth, elevation, sediment thickness, magnetic and gravities anomalies, radioactive flux, seismicity, electric conductivity, and proximity to faults and volcanoes. All estimates assumed the use of Organic Rankine Cycle power plants across all operating temperatures with a project lifetime of 25 years.

Using this model, Aljubran and Horne estimate that the annual net generation potential for EGS is over 300 times greater than the 2023 U.S. power consumption of 4,014 Terrawatt hours (TWh) (Figure 1). Although, it is important to note that much of that potential is between 6-7 km – indicating the need for improvements in drilling technology to help lower costs at these greater depths. Their results underscore the potential of EGS across the entire contiguous U.S., contingent on continued technological advancements in drilling technology, and highlights the value of detailed geologic mapping to identify regional opportunities.

Figure 1. Average annual EGS generation per unit area for projects spanning 1-7 kilometers in depth

Drilling deeper can lower costs

In addition to the mapping of EGS resource capacity, Aljubran and Horne also used their model to estimate the economic viability of EGS projects across the contiguous U.S. based on capital expenditure (CAPEX), operational expenditure (OPEX), and generation over time, which is represented as levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) across the contiguous U.S. in Figure 2. These estimates assume a discount rate of 7%, which reflects the future costs and energy production that have been converted to their present-day value. Their calculations also assumed an investment tax credit (ITC) of 30%, indicating the importance of federal tax credits to continue advancing early-stage technologies, such as next-generation geothermal. This was also documented in recent research by Ricks and Jenkins, where the ITC was critical to the successful scale-up of EGS technology in their simulations.

In addition to accounting for the LCOE, which takes into account the CAPEX, OPEX, and generation over time, Figure 2 shows how costs differ between using baseline drilling rates and advanced drilling rates. The advanced drilling rates are based on learnings from recent EGS projects, which demonstrated drilling cost reductions of nearly 50% after drilling approximately three wells. Use of advanced drilling rates resulted in an LCOE reduction of nearly 25% on average.

Figure 1. Optimal levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for EGS development across the contiguous U.S. for (a) baseline and (b) advanced drilling rates

Aljubran and Horne found that LCOE was lowest for nearly 90% of the contiguous U.S. by drilling to the deepest point of their studied depth (i.e., 7 km). LCOE was optimized at shallower depths (≤4 km) in a few regions across the western U.S. with high geothermal gradients (e.g., the Snake River Plain or the Great Basin) or where the geothermal gradient becomes more gradual with increasing depth (e.g., western North Dakota). This was attributed to increasing drilling costs with depth that don’t justify the benefit of a higher resource temperature.

What’s next?

Research by Aljubran and Horne illustrate the potential for EGS deployment across the contiguous U.S. Their research shows the large potential for EGS – potentially more than 300x the 2023 U.S. power consumption. It also shows the importance of thorough characterization of local and regional geology to understand resource potential. Additionally, their work determined that in many regions, such as those without exceptionally shallow heat resources, it makes economic sense to drill to deeper depths to maximize heat (i.e., 7 km). This is especially true with continued drilling rate improvements that have been documented in recent EGS projects.

Stay tuned for more from CATF as we continue to push forward bold ideas on how to scale higher enthalpy geothermal as an essential form of clean firm electricity anywhere it is needed.

(RFD-TV) — The House passed legislation aimed at speeding up energy and infrastructure development in rural America. The bill, known as the SPEED Act, is designed to reform the federal permitting process, which supporters say has delayed thousands of projects each year.

Western Caucus Chairman Doug LaMalfa has emphasized the need for full passage of the measure, warning that lengthy federal reviews continue to stall critical infrastructure improvements. The bill now heads to the U.S. Senate for consideration.

Jim Matheson, CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), joined us on Friday’s Market Day Report to discuss what the SPEED Act could mean for rural electric cooperatives and the communities they serve.

In an interview with RFD-TV News, Matheson explained why permitting reform is a top priority for electric cooperatives, which provide reliable, affordable power to more than 42 million Americans across 48 states.

Energy Transfer has suspended development of the Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana to focus on allocating capital to its backlog of gas pipeline projects it believes provide ""superior risk/return profiles"", the company said. ""Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project.""

Centrifuge manufacturing begins

New enrichment capacity expected to come online in 2029

BETHESDA, Md., Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU) announced today that it has begun domestic centrifuge manufacturing to support commercial Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) enrichment activities at its Piketon, Ohio, facility. This strategic move enables the company to capitalize on its many first-mover advantages in U.S.-owned domestic uranium enrichment, and marks one of the most consequential transformations in the company's and the United States' uranium enrichment history. Centrus plans to leverage its multi-billion-dollar uranium enrichment expansion to meet its growing backlog of $2.3 billion in contingent LEU sales to U.S. and international customer contracts, and targets future commercial-scale production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) as well.

""We are excited to announce the official commencement of our industrial-scale centrifuge manufacturing build for commercial LEU enrichment,"" said Centrus Energy CEO and President Amir Vexler. ""We make this announcement after carefully evaluating the business' internal and external progress as well as its future prospects and many competitive advantages. These include the significant progress in building our supply chain; the advancement across the many available avenues to acquire low-cost of capital to support our build, including imminent DOE funding announcements; and, evaluating the progress in our internal manufacturing capabilities.

""This historic step demonstrates Centrus' commitment to meeting our growing backlog of contingent commercial LEU customer contracts,"" continued Vexler ""Reclaiming American nuclear leadership on the global will catalyze additional private investment and enable further expansion as the market continues to grow. Uranium enrichment in Ohio has a big future, and this is just the beginning.""

Centrus' expansion is underpinned by public and private funding along with commercial contracts, a framework that includes:

Department of Energy funding: Centrus is a finalist for Task Orders from the Department of Energy for both LEU production and HALEU production – which the Department has indicated could be ~$900 million per task order.

Private capital: Centrus raised $1.2 billion via convertible note transactions in November 2024 and August 2025, reported a cash balance of more than $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, and recently launched a $1 billion at-the-market offering.

Customer contracts: Centrus has secured $2.3 billion in contracts and commitments from U.S. and international customers aimed at supporting new, U.S. uranium enrichment capacity. These agreements are contingent upon Centrus realizing certain milestones towards building the new capacity. Centrus continues to pursue additional LEU and HALEU sales opportunities.

Third party investment: This represents another potential avenue to secure low cost of capital financing while maximizing capacity. There is continued, growing interest from the market to secure future enrichment offtake by investing in new enrichment capacity.

Direct foreign investment: Centrus announced a proposed partnership with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and POSCO International in August 2025 to explore potential investment in new enrichment capacity in Ohio. The company continues to maximize efforts in this area with Korea and other nations.

National security: Centrus' AC100M centrifuge is the only U.S.-origin enrichment technology that is deployment-ready to fulfill national security missions – for which a U.S. technology is required. In October, the National Nuclear Security Administration announced its intent to contract with Centrus for LEU enrichment for national security. The company stands ready to support these critical national security missions.

The last U.S.-owned, large-scale uranium enrichment plant was built in the 1950s and shut down permanently in 2013, leaving America completely dependent upon foreign, state-owned enterprises that now control almost 100 percent of the world's uranium enrichment capacity. With demand for nuclear power expected to grow in the coming years – and imports of Russian enriched uranium completely banned starting in 2028 – new domestic, U.S.-owned uranium enrichment capacity is urgently needed and in high demand.

Creating American Jobs

The project is expected to support thousands of American jobs, including:

1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operating jobs in Ohio, while retaining 150 existing jobs at the Piketon plant.

Hundreds of new direct jobs at Centrus' centrifuge manufacturing plant in Tennessee and across a nationwide network of suppliers.

Thousands of indirect jobs in Ohio, Tennessee, and across the country.

Next Steps

Centrus has begun manufacturing centrifuges to support its uranium enrichment expansion at its centrifuge manufacturing factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, relying upon a domestic manufacturing supply chain. Centrus began expanding its manufacturing capacity in Tennessee in late 2024, and has already begun hiring in Tennessee and Ohio to support the project. The first new production capacity is expected to come online in 2029.

Dear Chairs Collins, Murkowski, Cole and Simpson, Vice Chair Murray, and Ranking Members Merkley, DeLauro and Pingree,

We, the members of the National Parks Second Century Action Coalition , urge you to support our national parks and national park staff as you conference the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Interior, Environment and Related Agencies appropriations bill. For months, NPS has been ravaged by resignation programs resulting in a tremendous loss of institutional knowledge, suffered from a hiring freeze for mission critical positions, had seasonal staff offers eliminated then reinstated well below promised levels, delayed grant funding, and had their ability to buy necessary products such as toilet paper for visitor restrooms revoked. Therefore, the Coalition supports the following requests for a conference bill:

Fundinglevels:SupporttheSenateBillFundingLevelsandAvoidOtherCuts

For more than a century, our national parks have remained America’s favorite places, important pieces of our natural and cultural heritage designated for future generations to explore and enjoy. Unfortunately, NPS has long been underfunded. Between 2011 and 2024, NPS lost over 2,000 permanent staff with an additional 4,000 lost since January. Visitor centers are reducing hours, trails and facilities are falling into disrepair, education programs are being cancelled and our nation’s natural and cultural heritage are at risk. We support the Senate bill acknowledges these impacts and largely maintains current funding at $2.859 billion for staffing, operations and public access throughout the National Park System. Unfortunately, the House bill cuts more than $176 million from the operations account. We are disappointed to seecuts in otherNPS accounts,including construction, and hopetheconference committee can avoid them.

ReductionInForce(RIF):ExtendCR/minibusProvisionProhibitingRIF&Restore Staff

Unfortunately, NPS has lost over 24% of its permanent staff since January reducing the agency’s ability to care for our nation’s most iconic places. Our parks’ natural and cultural heritage are already significantly at risk and the visiting experience and local economies that rely on visitors could be impacted. We commend Sec. 120 in the FY26 Continuing Appropriations, Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MCVA and Extensions Act (HR 5371), which prohibits RIFs through January 30th. We urge you to add a provision in conference extending this critically needed prohibition through the rest of the fiscal year. In addition, we request statutory language to restore permanent staff to at least 16,655, the amount of permanent staff in December 2025.

SenatePolicyProvisions:IncludeSenateBill’sProvisionsSupporting NPS

The administrative provision on page 23 of the bill requires that NPS “shall maintain staffing levels by hiring, retaining, and rehiring after separations in order to fulfill the [NPS] mission…” We urge you to retain this language, which would support resource protection, public access, visitor safety, tribal consultation and more. As noted above, specifying a specificstaff number would go even further.

We support the bill language on page 23 that specifies that disaster relief funds in the American Relief Act of December 2024 are obligated as intended by Congress. This law (P.L. 118-158) provided $2.3 billion in critically needed funds for numerous national parks significantly impacted by disasters including Hurricane Helene, which devastated the Blue Ridge Parkway and other southeastern NPS units.

We request inclusion of Sec.130,thatmaintainsnationalparksasfederalland. Though NPS lands cannot be disposed of without congressional authorization, this provision makes clear Congress’ intent that national parks cannot and should not be given away or sold. The administration’s FY26 budget proposed transferring NPS units, and their proposed funding cuts could eliminate hundreds of NPS units.

We applaud and urge inclusion provisions (Secs. 429, 430 and 431) that protect the Land andWaterConservationFund(LWCF). The LWCF is an incredibly effective and important conservation tool that protects national parks and other federal lands, as well as provide opportunities for public access and community recreation.

Sec. 448. We urge inclusion of this provision requiring notification to the appropriations committeesofRIFsandothersignificantworkforceactionswithin45days. This provision would ensure that indiscriminate firings not take place without congressional oversight. An extension of the RIF prohibition in HR 5371, as discussed above, would add substantial weight to this effort.

We also support these provisions that ensure accountability and transparency of appropriations and make it clear that the committee does not want the administration to sequester funds, delay grants, cancel grants with no cause, cancel leases without justification, and more.

Sec.443 requires 5-year construction plans including deferred maintenance. The 5-year plans for NPS have always been published in the annual NPS Budget Justifications but the administration did not publish that document this year.

Sec.444 is a new section requiring quarterly reporting of DOI and other agency disaster estimates. NPS is regularly devastated by costly incidents and transparency is important.

Secs. 446 and 447 would ensure that agencies including NPS must notify grant recipients of cancellations with justifications within a week, and that grants are awarded in a reasonable time frame. This supports routine grants that introduce students to nature, allow people to assist park staff in restoring trails, and otherwise connect people to natural and cultural resources.

Sec. 449 should ensure that funds are obligated as Congress intends. It expands a prior section on “Program Funding Incorporated by Reference” to list all the accounts for which agencies are directed by law to fund programs as specified in the committee report.

Sec.450 helps to safeguard employee compensation and benefits. For NPS, this means that NPS money cannot be robbed to pay for staff transferred to DOI for reorganization purposes as has been the case this year.

Sec. 451 requires 180 days notification with details to the congressional committees of jurisdiction prior to cancelling any building leases. This year, DOI sought to cancel 35 NPS building leases important for visitor services, resource protection, law enforcement, and more. Cancellation of these leases would have crippled many parks’ ability to meet their mission to ensure visitor enjoyment and safety and protect resources.

DisasterRelief:ProvideFundingforDisasters onNPSLand

Given the challenges of passing appropriations bills, we respectfully ask you to consider including emergency disaster funding for recovery from this year’s wildfires and floods in our national parks. This year, the Dragon Bravo fire destroyed infrastructure—including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge—and habitat at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. A wildfire caused significant and costly damage at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and flooding destroyed areas of Joshua Tree National Park. Absorbing these costs within a limited budget would be difficult or impossible.

In summary, our national parks and the park staff not only protect unique historic and natural resources but also support the national economy with more than fifteen dollars in economic activity for every dollar invested. National parks are more popular than ever with over 325 million visits a year contributing over $55 billion in economic output and supporting 415,000 jobs. In addition, America’s outdoor recreation economy supports over 5 million American jobs and contributes $1.2 trillion in annual economic output. In 2024, there were over 72.4 million international arrivals to the United States and research indicates that national parks were a huge tourism attraction for those visitors.

The future of our National Park System depends on Congress ensuring they have the funding and personnel to care for them. Therefore, we urge you to produce a conferenced FY26 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies bill that supports our parks.

Thank you for considering our views,",https://protectnps.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-cropped-Artboard-1-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-12-19 16:01:44.008578

In its most recent resource adequacy report, ERCOT modeled battery availability in December 2024, when operating reserves were low, and also during Winter Storms Cora, Enzo and Kingston in 2025.

What it found was that an energy emergency is less likely in January 2026 than in December 2025 because more storage projects will be connected to the grid. The battery systems allow for more availability in the early morning, when it’s harder to meet electricity demand, ERCOT reported.

Like gas turbines, battery systems have operational issues in cold weather. Left untreated when temperatures plunge, batteries become less effective as winter’s cold slows down internal chemical reactions and reduces their ability to discharge electricity.

ERCOT models its winter risk projections accounting for batteries’ lower state of charge but still found that the sheer influx of new energy storage facilities guards the grid against winter emergencies.

Since Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, ERCOT and other regulators have implemented a number of reforms, including requirements for power plants to weatherize for winter. Similar requirements for winter weatherization also now exist for battery systems.

Like all other energy resources, storage systems are subject to ERCOT inspections at least once every three years. The grid operator completed its fourth winter season inspection in April, evaluating more than 3,300 power plants and transmission facilities since the program began in response to Winter Storm Uri.

Some of the critical components within energy storage sites ERCOT identifies as at risk of failing in extreme weather emergencies include thermal management systems, inverters, fire suppression technology exposed to the cold, and heating and air conditioning equipment. If any of these systems fail, it could cause a trip, reduce capacity or prevent batteries from starting up.

The operators are required to show preparation records, or how they’ve implemented and maintained weather emergency measures. They also must conduct walkthroughs during which they show inspectors how they’ve implemented physical protections to the batteries, including waterproofing, wind-proofing and freeze-proofing. These weatherization efforts can assist in mitigating battery degradation or downtime altogether.

Keeping batteries within temperature ranges that minimize deterioration leads to less capacity loss or availability, said Adam Nygaard, vice president of business development at FlexGen, an energy storage integrator. Nygaard said FlexGen’s software tracks the ideal performance of the storage systems by creating a digital twin at each storage site. It allows the company to compare actual outcomes to what’s anticipated. “When we see variations, then we’re able to take action,” Nygaard said.

During Winter Storm Uri, FlexGen users had a 99.3 percent uptime, he said.

Unlike other grids across the country, ERCOT doesn’t pay companies just for being ready to provide energy when needed. Rather, ERCOT pays operators only when energy is actually used.

The cold weather makes it harder for developers to maximize electricity discharge during winter peak periods and means they could miss out on these payments for providing energy in emergencies, said John Murray, principal analyst on renewables at S&P Global Energy. That could significantly impact their revenue.

Often winter events in Texas last multiple days, Murray said. There’s no guarantee that batteries within ERCOT can quickly recharge during winter storms as solar underperforms and ice could lead to wind projects going offline.

“Winter price spikes in ERCOT are shorter, more chaotic and often tied to sudden generator outages,” Murray said.

The volatility of wind resources in winter, paired with the greater chance of thermal outages, are the difficult parts of wintertime within ERCOT, Nygaard said.

And given that ERCOT is isolated from the rest of the U.S. grid, there often aren’t any power imports during winter weather emergencies to recharge Texas’ batteries. Additionally, it’s harder to predict during these months what extra types of energy support may be needed, according to Murray, which complicates revenue modeling and presents business risk for the developers.

Even so, developers are still racing to connect battery projects to ERCOT.

In other news, 2025 is shaping up to be another record year for new energy storage installations. With Ford entering the market, the industry expects continued growth, despite some bumps in the road.

Here is your week in numbers.

BY THE NUMBERS

►$530/MW-day

The capacity price that would have cleared in the PJM Interconnection’s latest auction if it hadn’t set a temporary price cap of $333.44/MW-day — still a record high. The price cap was agreed to as part of the grid operator’s negotiations with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, D, who has threatened to pull his state out of PJM over skyrocketing prices (a feat easier said than done, according to some). The auction results increase pressure on state utility regulators to create new tariff structures to ease concerns about shifting costs from data centers to other utility customers, analysts said.

►20 GWh

The anticipated annual capacity of Ford’s new stationary energy storage business it plans to launch in 2027 after overhauling its electric vehicle strategy. The automaker says it will invest around $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business. It will convert plants in Kentucky and Michigan to produce lithium iron phosphate batteries, including 5 MWh+ battery energy storage systems and 20-foot DC container systems of the type used by data centers, utilities and large-scale industrial and commercial customers. It also plans to manufacture smaller Amp-hour cells for residential energy storage units.

►12.9 GW/36.2 GWh

Storage capacity installed in the U.S. over the first three quarters of 2025, according to the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie. That is already more than the 12.3 GW installed in all of 2024, which was a record. Despite near-term year-over-year declines in the utility-scale and residential segments, the report projects 92.9 GW of storage will be installed in the U.S. over the next five years. “[T]he market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

►$280M

The cost of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s ongoing “settlement adjustment” of its most recent capacity auction after discovering a software coding error that affected its planning reserve margins. Independent power producers have challenged that adjustment and asked FERC to reverse it, arguing that it amounts to an illegal “rerun” of the auction. MISO rejects that characterization. “MISO is not rerunning or resettling the [auction], nor will it take new bids or establish a new auction clearing price,” it said. Instead, it is applying an “appropriate adjustment” using corrected values consistent with the tariff, it said.

Why data centres are now an air quality issue

Data centres were not a major regulatory concern when much of the Clean Air Act’s stationary source framework was developed in the 1990s.

Today, they sit at the intersection of several regulatory pressure points.

Large numbers of stationary diesel and gas-fired generators, often permitted as emergency backup, are increasingly run for grid support.

Combustion turbines are being deployed for on-site or near-site power.

Facilities are clustering geographically, creating cumulative air quality impacts, and there is growing tension between ‘temporary’ or ‘emergency’ classifications and near-continuous operational realities.

For regulators, this creates uncertainty over how to apply New Source Performance Standards, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, and Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements.

The new EPA webpage is explicitly designed to reduce that uncertainty, but largely by clarifying how existing rules are interpreted rather than by strengthening or modernising them.

Regulator resources

This section centres on stationary engines and turbines, reflecting the reality that power provision, not computing hardware, is the dominant air quality issue for data centres.

It links to existing rules governing NOₓ, SO₂, particulate matter, and hazardous air pollutants from combustion sources, particularly those classified as emergency or non-emergency generators.

For monitoring specialists, this reinforces where regulatory scrutiny will continue to sit: stack emissions, fuel choice, operating hours, and compliance verification.

What is notable is the absence of new guidance on persistent monitoring gaps, such as real-world generator run-time verification or aggregated emissions accounting across multi-building data centre campuses.

Air permitting resources

The air permitting section aggregates historical EPA guidance documents, interpretive letters, and responses to state-level permitting questions.

Its importance lies not in introducing new standards, but in codifying precedent.

Developers and permitting authorities can now more easily see how EPA has historically interpreted its statutory obligations and where flexibility has been allowed.

For environmental monitoring professionals, this suggests continued demand for defensible modelling, emissions inventories, and reporting that supports permit applications and demonstrates compliance under PSD thresholds, rather than a shift toward more stringent or real-time measurement requirements.

Modelling guidance documents: why PSD still matters

The modelling section points users to EPA’s Guideline on Air Quality Models, including the agency’s preferred dispersion models for use in PSD permitting.

Despite repeated references to streamlining, this confirms that air quality modelling remains the primary gatekeeper for data centre development.

Model choice, emissions assumptions, meteorological data, and input quality will continue to determine whether projects trigger major source thresholds.

For those supplying or operating monitoring systems, this sustains demand for high-quality emissions data that can support or validate modelling outcomes.

Cooperative federalism in practice

EPA has strongly emphasised cooperative federalism, presenting the webpage as a tool to help states, Tribes, and developers align more easily on Clean Air Act requirements.

OAR staff have also committed to case-by-case consultation with permitting authorities and individual facilities.

In practice, this points toward greater decentralisation rather than uniform deregulation.

For monitoring professionals, it suggests a more fragmented regulatory landscape in which state-level decisions matter more, monitoring requirements may diverge significantly by jurisdiction, and instrumentation strategies need to be adaptable rather than standardised.

This is particularly relevant in regions where multiple data centres are being developed in close proximity and cumulative impacts are politically contested.

What the EPA is not addressing

The announcement repeatedly notes that many Clean Air Act requirements date back to the 1990s and have not kept pace with technological change.

However, the agency’s response stops short of a substantive update to emissions standards or monitoring expectations.

There is no new guidance on continuous emissions monitoring for generator fleets, no explicit framework for assessing cumulative regional impacts from clustered development, no linkage between air permitting and longer-term decarbonisation trajectories, and no commitment to expanding public or community-facing access to monitoring data.

The emphasis is on permitting efficiency rather than expanding the environmental intelligence base underpinning regulatory decisions.

Implications for environmental monitoring professionals

For those working in air quality and emissions monitoring, the launch of this resource is more about demand signals than new obligations.

Permitting-driven monitoring and modelling support are likely to remain growth areas. Instrumentation that supports generator emissions characterisation will stay relevant for as long as backup power remains fossil-based.

There is likely to be increased emphasis on defensible data that satisfies regulators, rather than denser or more precautionary measurement networks.

At the same time, community groups and Tribes may seek independent monitoring to counterbalance developer-led assessments, creating parallel demand outside formal permitting processes.

The Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centres is best understood as a stabilisation measure.

It reduces regulatory ambiguity at a moment when data centre construction is accelerating, electricity demand is rising, and political pressure to prioritise AI infrastructure is intensifying.

For environmental monitoring professionals, it does not fundamentally change how air quality compliance works.

What it does change is the pace. Projects are likely to move faster, with less tolerance for experimental monitoring regimes or precautionary approaches.

The unresolved question is whether future air quality impacts linked to data centre growth will be easier to prevent, or simply easier to permit.",https://www.envirotech-online.com/assets/file_store/pr_files/66410/thumbnails/images/600w_lee-zeldin-US-EPA.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:59:42.333436

This year in energy has been an absolute blur. We started with President Donald Trump’s declaration of a federal energy emergency, saw the gutting of clean-energy tax credits, and finished with an Election Day where affordability took center stage.

Now, with 2025 almost behind us, let’s rewind and revisit the 10 stories that defined this year.

Trump declares an energy emergency

On his first day in office, Trump set course for a total revamp of the American energy landscape. Step one: Citing rising power demand to declare a national emergency on energy, all while freezing funds for clean energy programs. Trump proceeded to use that ​“emergency” to prop up fossil fuels — more on that below.

Interior Department halts — then restarts — Empire Wind construction

The Trump administration’s laser focus on killing offshore wind became impossible to ignore when, in April, it ordered Empire Wind to stop work. The turbines off New York had only been under construction for a few weeks, and the stop-work order was eventually lifted. The story essentially repeated itself a few months later with the nearly complete Revolution Wind project.

The Department of Energy forces coal plants to stay open

In May, the U.S. DOE cited its ​“emergency” to force Michigan’s J.H. Campbell coal plant to run past its retirement date. That order has been extended twice, and so far, the plant has racked up more than $100 million in costs for utility customers. The DOE later ordered other soon-to-retire fossil-fueled plants to keep operating.

The ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” guts clean energy incentives

On the Fourth of July, Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was big but certainly not beautiful for clean energy. The legislation took an axe to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and its tens of billions of dollars in funding for the energy transition.

Nuclear gets a federal boost

At least one carbon-free power source has been exempt from Trump’s hit list. The administration has elevated nuclear power as a solution to rising power demand, including by promoting the restart of some retired nuclear plants. It’s also poured funding into the development of small modular reactors and other next-generation technologies.

Batteries have a stellar year, again

Energy storage was also spared the Trump administration’s wrath, though tariffs and ​“foreign entity of concern” rules will likely weaken the industry. Still, the U.S. installed 12.9 GW during the first three quarters of the year, already beating 2024’s total installed capacity of 12.3 GW.

EVs’ record quarter and collapse

Federal tax credits for EV purchases went out with a bang. In the three months before their expiration at the end of September, the U.S. saw nearly 440,000 new EVs hit the roads, smashing the past quarterly sales record. But now that we’re in a post-incentive world, EV sales have sunk.

Blue-state climate grants slashed

One of the Trump administration’s biggest attacks on clean energy came in October, when the DOE moved to claw back nearly $8 billion in grants for climate and energy projects, largely in states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The Justice Department later admitted in a court filing that those states’ politics put them in the administration’s crosshairs.

Data center opposition reaches a fever pitch

Data centers and their potential to use huge amounts of energy became a top concern in 2025, especially in hot spots like Virginia and Texas. State legislatures introduced close to 200 bills regarding data centers this year, with about 50 aimed at incentivizing their development, and others targeting their impact on the environment and on electricity costs for other consumers.

Energy affordability defines state elections

Democrats swept this year’s few statewide elections, many of which centered on rising energy prices. Both New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger campaigned on promises to tackle spiking energy costs, and the two Democrats who won seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission said they’d push to build more clean, cheap energy.

Ford trades EV ambitions for battery storage

From electrifying its bestselling F-150 to building a massive manufacturing complex in Tennessee, Ford once aspired to lead the EV transition. That all changed this week as the company announced it will incur nearly $20 billion in charges to extricate itself from its EV investments. That Tennessee facility, known as BlueOval City, will build gas-powered trucks in lieu of electric models, and production of the F-150 Lightning will end.

But as Ford backs away from EVs, it’s entering a new market. The automaker will repurpose its Kentucky EV battery facility to build grid-scale batteries instead. As Canary Media’s Julian Spector put it, Ford is essentially copying Tesla’s game plan to expand into storage — but without an EV stronghold to fall back on, it could be a risky move.

Another coal plant restart — and more to follow?

As you read above, the Trump administration’s coal plant restarts are a huge piece of its fossil-fuel-boosting agenda, and we got two more updates on that front this week. On Tuesday, the DOE ordered Unit 2 of TransAlta’s Centralia, Washington, coal power plant to stay open for the next 90 days. TransAlta has been planning since 2011 to shutter the facility, and was prepared to do so this month to comply with a Washington state law prohibiting coal burning that takes effect next year.

A similar situation may soon play out in Indiana, Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen reports. Two coal plants in the state are supposed to close this month, but their owners have told regulators they anticipate orders from the Trump administration will keep the facilities running.

Also this week: The U.S. House passed a bill that will broaden the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s authority to keep power plants online past their scheduled retirements.

The groups opposed the requested rate hike and asked that the Commission require VNG to take measures to improve its environmental justice efforts, including by protecting low-income rate payers from disproportionate impacts from rate increases like the one proposed.
“A one-time refund doesn’t fix a system that keeps asking low-income customers to pay more without a safety net.” “Virginia Organizing is disappointed by the SCC’s decision in the Virginia Natural Gas rate case.
“While folks are feeling the impact of higher prices across the board, a rate increase like this obviously hurts low-income customers more than anyone else.","RICHMOND, Va. – This week the State Corporation Commission approved another utility rate hike, this time for gas distribution company Virginia Natural Gas (VNG).

VNG requested the rate increase (its third in the last six years) due to capital costs associated with system growth as well as other investments, including its environmental justice initiatives.

SELC represented Appalachian Voices, The New Virginia Majority, and Virginia Organizing in the SCC proceeding. The groups opposed the requested rate hike and asked that the Commission require VNG to take measures to improve its environmental justice efforts, including by protecting low-income rate payers from disproportionate impacts from rate increases like the one proposed. Additionally, they asked the Commission to investigate the marketing practices driving VNG’s growth.

“Here you have a gas company wanting to increase its delivery charge by more than 25%, and it’s not considering or making meaningful efforts to blunt the impact on low-income communities—communities that everyone knows will be hit the hardest,” said Elizabeth Putfark, associate attorney at SELC. “That’s flatly inconsistent with the Environmental Justice Act. Meanwhile, VNG wants to keep doing the very thing that’s driving up rates—expanding. And it’s fueling that expansion with advertising that misinforms people about the price of gas relative to cleaner, cheaper electric alternatives.”

Ultimately, the Commission approved a lower rate increase than VNG initially proposed, accepting the modified revenue requirement stipulated to by both VNG and SCC staff. As a result, customers will receive a refund, plus interest, for the interim rates they have paid since January 1, 2025. But the Commission stopped short of requiring the Company to take any steps to protect low-income and historically marginalized communities from suffering disproportionate burdens due to the rate hike.

“This decision locks in higher bills for working families while offering them no new protections,” said Carl Poole, New Virginia Majority organizer for Norfolk. “A one-time refund doesn’t fix a system that keeps asking low-income customers to pay more without a safety net.”

“Virginia Organizing is disappointed by the SCC’s decision in the Virginia Natural Gas rate case. Our members are already struggling with their energy bills and cannot afford another increase, even if marginally less than requested by the utility,” said Patrice Smallwood, chairperson of Virginia Organizing’s State Governing Board member of its Norfolk chapter. “We’re also sad to see our environmental justice concerns largely dismissed. Seemingly, utility companies need only make a performance of environmental justice to satisfy the law when substantive action is what is really required.”

“It is disappointing to see yet another utility rate increase approved,” said Appalachian Voices’ Director of State Energy Policy Peter Anderson. “While folks are feeling the impact of higher prices across the board, a rate increase like this obviously hurts low-income customers more than anyone else. We will continue to push for systemic changes that make energy cleaner and more affordable for everyone.”",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SELC_Logo_Horizontal_Social.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 16:03:08.977798

Ferdi De Ville is Professor of European Political Economy at the Ghent Institute for International and European Studies, Department of Political Science, Ghent University. He is one of the promoters of the BE-WISE project.

On 30 December 2025, the rules of the European Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) for auctions related to the deployment of renewable energy sources enter into force. For Belgium, this will affect the auction for offshore wind energy in the Princess Elisabeth Zone. In this blog post we explain the rules around the innovative resilience criterion in the NZIA that must be applied in this tender.

‘The future of our clean tech industry has to be “Made in Europe”.’ That is how European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen summed it up in her 2023 State of the Union address.

She was responding to concerns that the EU could become as dependent on imports for clean energy technologies as it recently was on Russian natural gas. Import dependency for those technologies would make Europe geopolitically vulnerable and threaten the competitiveness of its industry.

Production of solar panels almost completely disappeared from Europe fifteen years ago and moved to China. In batteries, China has also acquired a dominant position, which in turn gives it a head start in manufacturing electric vehicles.

The wind industry is currently still a European success story. But China is rapidly catching up there too. It accounts for roughly 70% of global installation and manufacturing of wind turbines. China is conquering overseas markets and is now trying to sell its turbines in Europe as well. At the same time, Europe’s wind industry is under pressure from higher prices and interest rates and uncertainty over demand.

To ensure that Europe retains a sufficient industrial base for manufacturing clean energy technologies and to avoid excessive import dependency, the EU adopted the NZIA in June 2024. This law provides that by 2030 the Union must produce 40% of the clean energy technologies it installs itself, and, in doing so, secure a 15% global market share.

To achieve that, the NZIA requires Member States to take into account criteria other than price in their public procurements and auctions for deploying renewable energy sources.

The precise rules that governments must take into account are complex. In this blog post we explain the rules for auctions, which are especially relevant to the Belgian federal government’s offshore wind policy.

New conditions in auctions

Article 26 of the NZIA stipulates that Member States must include various non-price criteria (NPCs) in renewable energy auctions.

They must include pre-qualification criteria relating to corporate social responsibility, cybersecurity and data security, and the ability to complete the project in full and on time. With a pre-qualification criterion, breaching the rule results in exclusion of a bid.

Member States must also take into account the auction’s contribution to the Union’s sustainability and resilience, and may choose to include these as pre-qualification or award criteria. With an award criterion, breaching the condition costs the bidder points in that evaluation category.

The NZIA stipulates that in the coming years Member States must apply these criteria to at least 30% of the amount of renewable energy they auction each year—or at least 6 gigawatts per year if that is lower.

If applying these NPCs in a particular auction would, however, lead to a disproportionate cost increase of more than 15%, or to too few bids, then Member States are not obliged to apply the criteria (the Commission will publish guidance on how to demonstrate such disproportionate cost increases).

By the end of 2027 the European Commission will assess the effects of deploying these criteria, followed by a new evaluation every two years. If that evaluation is positive, the Commission may decide to extend the share of auctions in which the criteria must be applied or raise the required cost increase threshold that can justify an exception.

Although other NPCs can also help strengthen Europe’s clean tech sector, the resilience criterion is the most direct instrument the NZIA uses to counter excessive European import dependency.

Definition of resilience

The NZIA considers European resilience to be at risk when more than 50% of EU supply of a clean energy technology, or a key specific component thereof, comes from a third country. Resilience is also deemed at risk when supply reaches 40% and has increased by an average of at least 10 percentage points for two consecutive years.

Member States must take resilience into account in auctions for clean technologies and components for which these import dependency limits have been exceeded. Each year the European Commission will publish figures on the origin of technologies and components on the European market.

It did so for the first time in June 2025 for 25 end-products and components for which relevant information was available. For six technologies or their main components, there appears to be a dependence of at least 50% on imports from a third country. As shown in Table 1, in all cases this concerns imports from China.

Table 1 End-products and components for which supply dependency from a third country > 50%

Final product or component

Share of supply from China

Photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems 79% PV modules, cells or similar 94% PV inverters 50% PV wafers or similar 79% Permanent magnets in wind turbines 93% Battery packs, modules or cells 50% Anode active materials in batteries 81%

Excluding end-products and components from China

In May 2025 the European Commission published an implementing regulation clarifying exactly what conditions Member States must impose on bidders for auctions in which the resilience criterion is applied.

If the above-mentioned supply dependency limit has been exceeded for final products of the auctioned clean technology, the implementing regulation stipulates that final products may not come from that third country. For certain technologies, the regulation also sets limits on the use of components, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Rules for components where excessive supply dependency exists for the end-product

Final product

Rules on key components

Solar panels

At least four components not from the third country

Inverters, cells and modules not from the third country

Wind turbines

No more than three (four for offshore) components from the third country

Direct-drive drivetrain (incl. generator) and/or geared drivetrain (incl. generator) not from the third country

Electrolyser installations

No more than two components from the third country

The electrolyser stack not from the third country

Heat pumps

No more than one component from the third country

Anticipation in the wind sector

For wind turbines and electrolysers, the supply dependency limit is currently not exceeded. At present, for example, 97% of all wind turbines installed in the EU are also manufactured within the Union.

Nevertheless, in its implementing regulation the Commission decided that the rules from the previous section also apply to final products and components of wind turbines and electrolysers originating from China, for at least 75% of the end-products in a given tender.

In doing so, the Commission clearly aims to anticipate the risk of future conquest of the European market by Chinese wind turbines and electrolysers.

Impact on the Princess Elisabeth Zone

The rules on NPCs in auctions take effect on 30 December 2025. In Belgium, the resilience rule will affect for the first time the auction for the first lot of the Princess Elisabeth Zone (PEZ1).

The launch of that auction was postponed in 2025 by the federal Minister of Energy, Mathieu Bihet, to the first quarter of 2026, which brings it under the NZIA rules.

Belgium is required next year to apply the NZIA NPCs to at least 30% of the renewable energy capacity it auctions. With an envisaged capacity of 700 MW, it seems inevitable that these criteria will be applied in PEZ1.

Concretely, this means the federal government will have to include the following resilience conditions in its tender:

At least 75% of the turbines used must not come from China

In at least 75% of the turbines used, no more than four key components may come from China and the drivetrains must not come from China

No more than 85% of the permanent magnets used in the turbines may come from China

The Belgian government may choose to include these conditions as pre-qualification or award criteria. If it opts for the latter, the weight of these conditions must be at least 5% of the final score, and the combined weight with sustainability conditions must lie between 15% and 30%.

In making these choices, the government must weigh strengthening European resilience against the feasibility and affordability of the project.

The auction for the Princess Elisabeth Zone thus becomes a first test case for applying the NZIA rules.

In a next blog post on the NZIA we will examine the resilience rules in public procurement, for example for the installation of solar panels on a municipal swimming pool. In the final post of this series we will discuss in detail the trade-offs involved in deploying these rules.",https://www.ugent.be/logo.png,N,,2025-12-19 19:00:22.310441

These unique competitive advantages have contributed to billions of dollars in announced clean hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol projects in Louisiana.
Louisiana’s Clean Hydrogen Task Force Recognizing this momentum, the Louisiana Legislature created the Clean Hydrogen Task Force through HCR 64 during the 2024 session.
Its charge was clear and ambitious: evaluate Louisiana’s opportunities for clean hydrogen and recommend strategies to accelerate the state’s clean hydrogen economy.
Hydrogen reinforces Louisiana’s energy economy and clean hydrogen opens new economic pathways tied to emerging global demand for low-emission commodities.","Hydrogen is already a critical input to the U.S. economy, used extensively in refining, ammonia production, and methanol manufacturing industries. These sectors rely on hydrogen at scale to produce transportation fuels, fertilizers, and chemical feedstocks that underpin global energy and agricultural systems. Traditionally, most hydrogen is produced using emissions-intensive processes integrated into existing industrial operations. In recent years, however, clean hydrogen, defined by its lower lifecycle emissions, has gained traction because of its versatility across a wide range of end uses, from high-temperature industrial processes to heavy-duty transportation, as well as its growing role in the international markets. Clean hydrogen brings significant opportunity to attract new industries, support high-quality jobs, improve local air quality, and strengthen U.S. global competitiveness.

These opportunities are especially relevant for Louisiana, where a strong industrial base, existing hydrogen demand and production capacity, and significant geological storage potential create a compelling foundation for clean hydrogen deployment and long-term growth. Louisiana has the ingredients to become one of the country’s most competitive clean hydrogen leaders. Few states have a hydrogen ecosystem as mature as Louisiana’s. Today, the state is already one of the nation’s top hydrogen producers and consumers due to the concentration of refining, ammonia production, and methanol facilities. According to our recent U.S. hydrogen demand assessment, with a total dedicated hydrogen production of almost 2.5MMT, Louisiana ranks #1 nationally in both dedicated hydrogen production and ammonia production capacity, #2 in refining capacity, and #3 in hydrogen production for petroleum refining, while also being one of the nation’s leading methanol-producing states. These industries have spent decades building expertise, workforce depth, and safe infrastructure that translate directly into an advantage for scaling clean hydrogen.

This strong industrial base is paired with another major asset in the state: carbon capture and sequestration. Louisiana leads the nation in Class VI well applications and sits on world-class geology for permanent carbon dioxide storage. Combining a robust hydrogen industry with unparalleled CCS potential positions Louisiana to lead on clean hydrogen production and deployment. These unique competitive advantages have contributed to billions of dollars in announced clean hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol projects in Louisiana.

Louisiana’s Clean Hydrogen Task Force

Recognizing this momentum, the Louisiana Legislature created the Clean Hydrogen Task Force through HCR 64 during the 2024 session. Its charge was clear and ambitious: evaluate Louisiana’s opportunities for clean hydrogen and recommend strategies to accelerate the state’s clean hydrogen economy. The 17-member Task Force was comprised of agencies, utilities, industry, economic development organizations, and nonprofits, including CATF as a member. Over 18 months, the group met regularly, hearing from project developers, academics, and state and federal officials to develop a set of recommendations intended to accelerate clean hydrogen in the state.

Key findings and recommendations

The Task Force voted for unanimous adoption of its report and sent it to Governor Jeff Landry at the beginning of December 2025, with a clear message that hydrogen has potential to grow in Louisiana and its production and deployment should be supported. Hydrogen reinforces Louisiana’s energy economy and clean hydrogen opens new economic pathways tied to emerging global demand for low-emission commodities.

These recommendations fall into three major policy buckets:

State leadership. Sustained state agency coordination on hydrogen and ongoing engagement with the federal government offers benefits to Louisiana as incentives and regulatory frameworks evolve.

Economic development. The state can develop action plans to identify priority end uses, expand workforce training, and prepare for infrastructure build-out aligned with industry needs and demand.

Regulatory clarity. Louisiana can adopt a clear, credible definition of clean hydrogen for market clarity and strengthen regulatory capacity for efficient and safe project reviews and permitting. Aligning this definition with emerging international standards for low-carbon hydrogen would also help position Louisiana to compete in expanding export markets.

CATF sees real opportunity and meaningful impact in moving a few of these recommendations forward that are ready for implementation. In particular, the strategic economic development plan has significant potential to align near-term project announcements with long-term growth opportunities and infrastructure planning, tying together production hubs with local and global offtake. Expanded regulatory capacity would help the state evaluate projects quickly and responsibly.

Looking ahead

As the Legislature prepares for the upcoming session, advancing the Task Force’s recommendations will be critical for translating momentum into action and ensuring Louisiana captures the full breadth of benefits of a growing hydrogen industry. Louisiana has a real chance to lead, but doing so will require clear direction, strong state leadership, and sustained commitment. The state’s competitive advantages are significant: a built-in hydrogen market, deep CCS expertise, existing pipeline and port infrastructure, an experienced workforce, and a growing pipeline of projects. Companies and investors have already proposed billions in projects for clean hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol investments. The question now is whether the state will put the policies into place that enable this opportunity to flourish.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/19100703/louisiana-industry.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 16:00:39.833964

Josh Stein visited Old Fort on Thursday to highlight $270 million in federal funding that will go toward water infrastructure projects in areas hit by Hurricane Helene.

Nearly five-dozen water and septic system projects in 26 western counties will receive funding through the state Department of Environmental Quality. The funds are part of a total of $685 million appropriated by Congress last December to help communities in North Carolina rebuild their water and sewer infrastructure to be more resilient to future flood events.

Old Fort will receive a total of $15 million — including $5 million for sewer repair and $10 million for water line improvements.

Most of the projects will take years to complete. Stein said the increasing frequency of major flood events makes it vital for local communities to rebuild with resiliency in mind.

“We have to be better prepared to withstand these storms when they hit our state,” he said at the event at the McDowell Technical Community College Workforce Education Center. “Projects like this one in Old Fort is just one example of how DEQ is incorporating resilience into that recovery work.”

State Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson and Old Fort Mayor Pam Snypes joined Stein at the event.

“Old Fort is not alone,” Wilson said. “All across the mountains, towns have experienced major damage to their drinking water systems, their wastewater systems, their septic systems. Here, it washed away portions of the water distribution system and the wastewater collection systems in several areas. And it was just kind of amazing to see that extent of devastation.”

Old Fort aims to improve a total of 23,600 linear feet of water lines and 5,500 linear feet of sewer infrastructure. Snypes said the funding will be transformational for the town.

“It’s not going to be a fast process,” Snypes said. “But once it’s completed, the town of Old Fort’s water and sewer system will be one of the best in Western North Carolina.”

Where else the money is going

Among the other recipients highlighted by the governor’s office:

Chimney Rock Village (Rutherford County) will receive $2.7 million for a drinking water system resiliency project, $5 million for a new wastewater treatment plant and sewer resiliency improvements, and $4 million to extend sewer lines to connect homes with septic systems.

Western Piedmont Council of Governments will receive $7.5 million to repair 300 Helene-damaged and failed septic systems in Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Mitchell, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yancey counties.

Town of Burnsville (Yancey County) will receive $8.2 million for drinking water supply and distribution improvements and nearly $4.9 million for Hickory Lane and West Glendale Avenue sewer line improvements.

Town of Clyde (Haywood County) will receive $4.3 million for a drinking water system interconnection with the Towns of Canton and Waynesville, and $5 million for wastewater system resiliency improvements.

Town of Crossnore (Avery County) will receive nearly $5.4 million for drinking water system resiliency improvements and nearly $5 million for wastewater system resiliency improvements.

The full list of recipients can be found here.

Two more deadlines for additional funding are coming up in January and March. Local governments can apply through the state Department of Environmental Quality.

FEMA reimbursement delays

Stein also said he and members of the state’s congressional delegation will continue to push the federal government to pick up the “incredibly slow” pace of FEMA reimbursements for local municipalities that are struggling after having to use their own funds to cover the cost of disaster recovery.

There is currently about $1 billion worth of funding that has been expended by local governments and is currently awaiting FEMA review, Stein said. The requirement by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that all expenses over $100,000 must receive her personal approval has created “an additional layer of red tape,” he noted.

“We have been championing our local governments that put money out the door with the full expectation that FEMA would reimburse them. … What happens is it just immediately builds back up, because it’s taking too long for that review to happen,” Stein said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e6cf2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2F01%2F16b229594d1490f2c23cb66c66f3%2Fimg-7557.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:59:34.836934

“Today’s order is a monumental step towards fortifying America’s national and economic security in the AI revolution, while ensuring we preserve just and reasonable rates for all Americans. I look forward to tackling more of these critical national issues with my colleagues in the New Year,” said Chairman Laura Swett.

Locking Up Power Plants

Thursday’s order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Talen Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, according to the Associated Press.

Utilities argued colocation allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid.

Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.

In addition to the Talen Susquehanna nuclear power plant, energy companies have been buying or locking up existing power plants to serve A.I. data centers, including--

There is no doubt the soaring demand for energy from A.I. data centers is already bringing Pennsylvania’s electric grid perilously close to being unreliable, as the results of the PJM capacity auction this week show.

Tom Rutigliano, Natural Resources Defense Council, said ""Summer 2027 will be the first time in PJM’s history it expects to not have enough power to reliably meet demand because of new data center forecasts and the ongoing risk of fossil fuel [natural gas] generators failing during winter storms.

""This auction leaves no doubt that data centers’ demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply, and the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself,” said Stu Bresler, PJM Executive Vice President – Market Services and Strategy, who becomes chief operating officer on Jan. 7.

PUC Commissioner Kathryn Zerfuss said-- “So we all know that we have many challenges as it relates to energy supply and demand, and the gap between supply and demand is just growing more and more every day.

“We totally maintain that we have to take advantage of every single molecule and electron we can from all energy sources, whether it's solar, wind, for our electric grid.” Read more here.

The Order

In the order, the Commission finds PJM’s tariff unjust and unreasonable due to a lack of clarity and consistency in the rates, terms, and conditions that apply to interconnection customers serving co-located load and eligible customers taking transmission service on behalf of co-located loads.

PJM’s tariff is unreasonable because it does not account for transmission services where eligible customers can manage energy withdrawals for co-located load.

FERC directs PJM to revise its tariff to require its eligible (transmission) customers serving co-located load to choose from several transmission service options.

“Clarifying new rules will help release the bottleneck of large load investments across the PJM footprint,” said Chairman Swett.

FERC also directs PJM to report, by January 19, 2026, on the status of its proposals to speed up the addition of generating capacity, including--

-- Expedited interconnection process for shovel-ready projects,

-- Changes to PJM’s reliability backstop mechanism for resource shortfalls, and

-- Enhanced load forecasting and demand flexibility measures to identify new capacity needed for system reliability.

That effort led to the creation of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the organization that later became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.
Those early efforts laid the groundwork for the monitoring and restoration work the Pontchartrain Conservancy focuses on today.
""Our goal is to work with teachers teaching earth sciences to build hyper-local activities so they can teach about the wetlands in south Louisiana,"" Trail said.","Long before she ran Pontchartrain Conservancy, Kristi Trail was a kid on the lakefront, swimming in water most people learned to avoid because of its pollution. Even so, that early connection to the lake shapes the work that led to her 2025 Inspirit Award.

Trail has served as the executive director of the Pontchartrain Conservancy for nine years. The award recognizes her work protecting the water, land and communities across the 16 parishes in the Pontchartrain Basin.

During her tenure, the organization has nearly doubled its staff from 16 to more than 30, reflecting its expanding environmental and education work.

As the organization has grown, Trail keeps returning to the thought that first drew her to this work: how people are able to experience the lake itself.

Trail says that when it comes to lakefront swimming, the northshore has easier access than the southshore which is complicated because of the amount of infrastructure.

That access question, she said, is part of a larger conversation about reconnecting people with the lake — a conversation that often leads to Lincoln Beach, a place many residents haven’t been able to access for decades.

Trail is pleased that the city of New Orleans is working hard to reopen Lincoln Beach, which is expected to be done in 2026, because the space holds a significant place in New Orleans’ history. Established in 1938, it provided a haven for the Black community. For Trail, its reopening represents a step toward restoring not just access, but the relationship people once had with the lake.

""We take credit for cleaning up the lake and are so excited for people to go out and enjoy our beautiful lake,"" Trail said.

Trail remembers the ""Save our Lake"" campaign that started in 1989, when a group of residents and scientists came together to raise concern of the region's environmental challenges. That effort led to the creation of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the organization that later became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Those early efforts laid the groundwork for the monitoring and restoration work the Pontchartrain Conservancy focuses on today. One of Trail’s goals is for the lake to become top of mind again for people in south Louisiana. She believes the organization’s long-term water-quality improvements are helping move it in that direction.

""Sometimes people don't even think about the lake because they don't look at it,"" she said. ""We want to make it beautiful — to make it something people want to look at.""

Since 2001, Pontchartrain Conservancy has released weekly water-quality reports to help residents understand conditions at swimming spots and other recreational areas around the basin.

""The lake is a very dynamic system,"" Trail said. ""It changes on a daily basis, but on a long-term trend, it's good and improving.""

But Trail and her staff are using their resources to educate and inform beyond the shores of Pontchartrain by offering teacher training across the state. The trainings focus on a variety of water issues — from marine debris, the effect of microplastics, water quality, types of flooding and more.

The staff development classes usually take place on Saturdays at the Lighthouse Museum — or in schools across Louisiana. Teachers receive a $100 stipend for participating in the training, plus a kit of supplies to take back to their classrooms.

""Our goal is to work with teachers teaching earth sciences to build hyper-local activities so they can teach about the wetlands in south Louisiana,"" Trail said.

She said the number of students visiting the interactive Lighthouse museum for hands-on programs continues to grow each year.

""Under Kristi's leadership, Pontchartrain Conservancy was awarded an EPA Gulf Guardian Award (given to agencies making positive impacts on the Gulf of Mexico's health) for its work in STEM education in 2024, showing how impactful this work is not just in Louisiana but across the Gulf coast,"" wrote board chair Dickie Brennan in his nomination of Kristi Trail for the Inspirit Award.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/9c/79c21f9e-ea6d-42da-bd68-c5369d7d3bf8/693b3df16cfc2.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C176&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-19 13:00:15.541546

That approach has helped Woodside become a larger player in the global gas market.
Woodside Chief Operating Officer Daniel Kalms and Chief Commercial Officer Mark Abbotsford are among potential picks, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s deliberations.","The surprise exit of Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill leaves her successor with a dilemma: should the Australian company continue down the path she set of promoting massive liquefied natural gas projects when forecasts point to a glut and lower prices?

O’Neill had been a forceful advocate for two major projects: Browse — a long-delayed plan to tap vast offshore reserves in Western Australia — and an expansion of the company’s export terminal in Louisiana, which is still under construction. Her stance reflected a company forecast for a 50% jump in global LNG demand over the next decade — one of the most bullish in the industry.

But with O’Neill now set to helm oil major BP Plc in April, Woodside’s incoming CEO will need to decide whether to stay the course as a record wave of global LNG supply is poised to flood the market and drag down prices for the remainder of the decade. Coupled with a surplus of oil, Woodside will face growing questions from investors about why it is doubling down on fossil-fuel expansion at a time when supply is abundant.

“The board and the new CEO can now rethink the value destructive Browse project, which is more expensive than 70% of competing potential new gas supplies around the world, as well as the expansion of Louisiana LNG,” the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, or ACCR, said in a statement on Thursday.

At the core of the debate is the future role of natural gas. O’Neill and other industry leaders argue that gas will help coal-dependent nations transition to a cleaner-burning fossil fuel while providing reliable backup for intermittent renewable power.

However, that outlook isn’t guaranteed. Volatile LNG prices have pushed some emerging nations to rethink their reliance on imports — Pakistan, for instance, is stepping back from LNG as households and businesses turn rapidly to solar. Others, including India and China, are leaning on cheaper coal to bolster energy security and keep costs down.

Global LNG supply is set to jump by more than 50% by 2030 from 2024, far more than demand growth in recent years, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Daan Struyven said in a note on Thursday. “LNG prices will likely have to decline significantly as this oversupply builds to incentivize additional demand,” they said.

That creates some uncertainty over Woodside’s long-term strategy, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “O’Neill’s successor might rewrite Woodside’s gas playbook — a probability that could weigh on sentiment until the future path is clear,” analyst Anthony Chen said in a note.

Still, O’Neill has said that she looks at making decisions that will pan out over decades, and won’t get derailed by short-term market trends. According to a note from Bernstein, she has taken a disciplined approach relative to peers, exiting several green-hydrogen and renewables projects based on weakened demand, and refocused efforts on LNG.

That approach has helped Woodside become a larger player in the global gas market. She has cleared a path for North West Shelf — a sprawling LNG export plant that earlier this year was granted clearance to continue operating until 2070. And she oversaw the approval of the Scarborough offshore field, which is expected begin shipments during the second half of next year.

One of O’Neill’s last acts was restructuring the company’s LNG trading desk, including hiring a new head from Equinor ASA, to better withstand lower prices and market the wave of new supply, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Several contenders for the top job have already been mooted in industry circles. Woodside Chief Operating Officer Daniel Kalms and Chief Commercial Officer Mark Abbotsford are among potential picks, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s deliberations. The senior vice president for M&A, Dan Hamilton, could also be in the running, said another industry source who has worked closely with the company.

For now, Australian Chief Operating Officer Liz Westcott is running Woodside as interim CEO. The company is looking at internal and external candidates and plans to announce a permanent appointment in the first quarter, it said on Thursday.

The new chief will be tasked with lining line up another equity partner for Woodside’s $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG project and keep the company’s foray into Mexico on track as the Trion development moves toward producing oil later this decade.

On top of that, they will have to face increasingly vocal opposition from climate campaigners and the company’s own shareholders. At a meeting in May, protesters repeatedly interrupted O’Neill’s opening address by blowing on whistles, while a year earlier Woodside investors rejected the company’s climate strategy in a non-binding vote.

“Woodside has been persistently unresponsive to shareholder concerns,” the ACCR said. “Investors will be hoping that O’Neill’s departure is a circuit breaker on Woodside’s habit of pursuing high-capex, marginal fossil fuel projects, and is an opportunity to instead start focusing on better capital returns.”

How does a CfD auction work?
CfD contracts are awarded through annual auctions or ‘Allocation Rounds’.","Annual clean power auctions, known as Allocation Rounds, are the primary way the Government unlocks investment in new offshore and onshore wind, solar and tidal energy projects. Successful projects are awarded ‘Contracts for Difference’ (CfDs) to generate clean power.

What is the CfD scheme?

The Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme is the Government’s main mechanism for unlocking investment in low-carbon electricity generation. It’s essentially an auction for power contracts between generators and Government. Since its introduction in 2014, the CfD scheme has been hugely successful in supporting the expansion of homegrown clean energy, driving down costs to consumers and incentivising technological innovation.

In fact, it’s been so successful many countries around the world have subsequently copied it, with the EU in the process of finalising regulations to ensure national-level support schemes across Europe follow the two-way CfD model.

In the UK, the 20-year CfD contracts awarded via the auction are between a low carbon electricity generator (e.g. a developer of a solar farm) and the Government-owned Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC). Developers of new clean energy projects bid in a competitive auction to receive a contract which guarantees a fixed price for the electricity they generate.

Allocation Round 7 (AR7) refers to the seventh allocation round of the CfD scheme. The results for this latest round will be announced by the Government in January and February 2026.

How do CfDs benefit consumers?

The electricity market is highly volatile and the market price can change dramatically, so a mechanism to ensure stability is desirable to both protect consumers and provide a stable revenue stream for investors. CfD contracts address this by agreeing a fixed ‘strike price’, which represents the price the project will receive for each megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity it generates during the contracted period.

This strike price is then measured against the market price of electricity over the course of the contract. When the market price is higher than the strike price, the generator pays back the difference to the consumer via the LCCC. When it is lower, the LCCC tops up the generator via electricity bills.

By fixing prices, CfDs also significantly reduce the risk investors are exposed to. This reduction in risk lowers the costs of financing projects by enabling capital to be borrowed on more favourable terms, making wind farms cheaper than they would be otherwise. This is vital as a huge amount of the costs of renewable energy projects are up-front capital costs (i.e. manufacturing and building the wind farms), with remaining costs over the lifetime of the project much lower than other sources of generation (largely because, unlike nuclear and gas plants which pay for their fuel, the wind is free).

Recent analysis has found that a future UK electricity system, and Europe-wide system, powered by offshore wind is lower cost for billpayers than alternatives, including unabated gas.

How does a CfD auction work?

CfD contracts are awarded through annual auctions or ‘Allocation Rounds’. To enter an auction, developers need to satisfy the eligibility requirements and confirm the size of their project, the year it will start delivering power and, most importantly, a sealed bid stating the price they can provide each MWh of electricity their project produces at – the strike price.

The Government caps the maximum a project can bid by setting the highest price it is willing to offer, known as the ‘Administrative Strike Price’ (ASP), which a developer cannot bid above. The Government then awards contracts to bidders with the lowest strike price(s) until the auction budget has been spent. Crucially, sealed bids keep prices low by ensuring developers cannot see the bids of other projects.

What is the budget?

The budget is set by the Government and acts as a means of controlling the total number of projects that can secure contracts within a given auction. It is a limit on the number of projects that can win a CfD, rather than a fixed cost.

Somewhat confusingly, the budget is not a reflection of how much the projects will actually cost, the impact of the projects on public spending, or the total impact on consumer bills.

The budget is rather dictated by the difference between the strike price and an estimate of the average market price for electricity for renewable energy, known as the ‘reference price’. When the reference price is low, the budget needed to support a given project is higher, and vice-versa.

In reality, however, the actual market price of electricity will vary (and is typically much higher than the ‘reference price’ used to set the budget). Whilst we don’t have a crystal ball, meaning future CfD costs and precise consumer benefits will always be unknown at the time of the auction, the fixed price hedges against this uncertainty.

What is the significance of AR7?

Ahead of AR7, the UK has a record amount of offshore wind capacity eligible to bid in - more than 20 gigawatts - which could attract up to £53 billion in private investment in the UK economy.

This year’s auction has seen significant delays compared to previous years, due to a series of reforms to the CfD process, including the introduction of 20-year contracts.

Besides providing lower-cost clean electricity, a successful AR7 that maximises investment in renewable energy projects will bring many wider benefits to the UK, including:",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-19 16:00:44.198820

The American energy infrastructure stands at a crossroads where bureaucratic complexity intersects with urgent national economic imperatives. Federal permitting processes designed decades ago now govern energy projects essential for economic competitiveness, national security, and energy independence. This regulatory framework, originally conceived to protect environmental resources, has evolved into a labyrinthine system that can delay critical infrastructure for years. Understanding permitting reform in U.S. energy sector initiatives requires examining both current bottlenecks and proposed solutions.

The Multi-Decade Timeline Problem in Energy Project Approvals

Energy infrastructure development in the United States faces unprecedented delays through federal approval processes. These delays cascade through the economy, affecting everything from regional job creation to national energy security. The permitting bottleneck affects multiple energy sectors simultaneously, creating compound effects on investment confidence and project viability.

Current federal permitting timelines vary significantly across energy sectors, but all face substantial delays compared to private sector project development speeds. Natural gas pipeline projects often require multiple years for federal review, while transmission line approvals can stretch even longer due to complex interstate coordination requirements.

The economic ripple effects extend beyond immediate project costs. Delayed infrastructure investments affect regional economic development, manufacturing competitiveness, and energy price stability. Investment capital allocated for energy projects often sits idle during extended review periods, reducing overall economic productivity.

NEPA's Unintended Consequences on Energy Security

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 established environmental review requirements for major federal actions affecting environmental quality. While the legislation achieved important environmental protection goals, its implementation has created unintended barriers to energy infrastructure development critical for contemporary economic needs.

Modern energy projects face environmental review processes designed for a different technological and economic era. The 1970 legislation could not anticipate current challenges like artificial intelligence data center power demands, renewable energy integration requirements, or global supply chain vulnerabilities affecting critical minerals and energy security.

Multiple federal agencies often conduct parallel environmental reviews for the same project, creating duplicative processes that extend timelines without necessarily improving environmental outcomes. These overlapping reviews reflect institutional structures rather than environmental necessity, consuming both public and private resources inefficiently.

What Does the SPEED Act Actually Change in Federal Energy Policy?

Congressional action on permitting reform represents a significant shift in federal energy policy priorities. The Standardising Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, known as H.R. 4776, passed the House of Representatives in December 2025 with bipartisan support, indicating growing recognition that permitting modernisation serves national economic interests.

Standardisation Framework for Environmental Reviews

The legislative approach focuses on process efficiency rather than environmental standard elimination. The framework establishes consistent timelines across federal agencies while maintaining environmental protection requirements. This standardisation aims to create predictable investment timelines for energy infrastructure developers.

Federal agencies would operate under coordinated review schedules, eliminating duplicative environmental assessments that currently extend project timelines. The legislation requires agencies to establish firm deadlines for environmental review completion, providing investment certainty that has been lacking under current processes.

Technology-neutral permitting standards would apply equally across energy sectors, from natural gas infrastructure to renewable energy projects. This approach avoids favouring particular energy technologies while ensuring all projects face consistent regulatory expectations.

Bipartisan Fractures and Political Implementation Challenges

The legislation's House passage demonstrated some bipartisan support, with Republican Chairman Bruce Westerman of Arkansas as primary sponsor and Democratic Representative Jared Golden of Maine as co-sponsor. However, Senate prospects remain uncertain, reflecting ongoing political divisions over federal regulatory roles.

Industry coalition support spans multiple energy sectors, but environmental organisations oppose aspects of the legislation they believe could weaken environmental protections. This opposition creates political pressure on Senate Democrats who must balance environmental constituency concerns with economic development interests.

State-level regulatory interactions complicate federal reform implementation. Energy projects often require both federal and state approvals, meaning federal permitting acceleration provides limited benefits if state processes remain slow. Coordination between federal and state regulators will determine reform effectiveness.

Which Energy Sectors Stand to Benefit Most from Permitting Modernisation?

Permitting reform impacts vary across energy sectors based on current regulatory bottlenecks and infrastructure development needs. Natural gas infrastructure faces some of the most complex federal approval processes, making this sector a primary beneficiary of streamlined reviews.

Natural Gas Infrastructure and Export Capacity Expansion

Natural gas pipeline development requires extensive federal coordination due to interstate transportation routes and environmental crossing requirements. Current approval processes can delay pipeline projects for years, limiting natural gas market access and export capacity expansion.

Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, emphasised that comprehensive permitting reform represents a strategic imperative for the oil and natural gas industry. Without streamlined approvals, American energy production cannot operate at the pace needed to meet domestic demand or support international allies.

Export facility development faces particularly complex approval processes involving multiple federal agencies. Liquefied natural gas terminals require coordinated environmental reviews covering marine impacts, air quality, and safety considerations. Furthermore, the impact of trade war market impact considerations has made streamlined federal coordination even more critical for accelerating LNG export capacity development.

Regional economic development benefits concentrate in energy-producing areas where pipeline infrastructure creates construction employment and ongoing operational jobs. States like Texas, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia would see significant economic impacts from accelerated natural gas infrastructure development.

Electric Grid Modernisation and Transmission Line Development

Transmission infrastructure represents another major beneficiary of permitting reform due to complex interstate coordination requirements. High-voltage transmission lines often cross multiple state boundaries and federal land holdings, requiring extensive environmental review coordination.

National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors could benefit significantly from streamlined federal approvals. These designated corridors aim to address transmission bottlenecks limiting renewable energy development and grid reliability improvements.

Grid modernisation projects essential for integrating renewable energy sources face current permitting delays that slow clean energy deployment. Transmission infrastructure development enables renewable energy resource areas to connect with population centres requiring clean electricity.

Critical Minerals and Domestic Supply Chain Security

Domestic mining projects face extensive federal permitting requirements that have contributed to American dependence on foreign mineral supplies. Critical minerals essential for battery production, renewable energy technologies, and defence applications often require lengthy environmental reviews.

Strategic mineral independence requires accelerated domestic production capacity, but current permitting timelines discourage mining investment. Reform could balance environmental protection with national security priorities in critical mineral development through comprehensive mining permitting insights.

Supply chain vulnerabilities exposed during recent global disruptions highlight the importance of domestic mineral production capacity. Streamlined permitting could facilitate strategic mineral development while maintaining appropriate environmental safeguards.

How Do Recent FERC and DOE Regulatory Changes Support Reform Goals?

Federal agencies have begun implementing permitting improvements independently of comprehensive legislative reform. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy have initiated process improvements that complement broader reform objectives, particularly following recent executive order on permits initiatives.

Agency-Level Implementation of Permitting Acceleration

FERC has modified certain construction authorisation procedures to reduce regulatory delays for natural gas infrastructure projects. These administrative changes demonstrate agency recognition that current processes create unnecessary bottlenecks without improving environmental outcomes.

The Department of Energy has implemented NEPA process improvements for projects under its jurisdiction, including renewable energy developments on federal lands and critical mineral assessments. These changes reflect agency adaptation to contemporary energy development needs.

Interagency coordination improvements have begun addressing duplicative review processes that extend project timelines. Better coordination between agencies reduces redundant environmental assessments while maintaining comprehensive environmental protection.

Judicial Review Limitations and Legal Certainty Measures

Post-approval challenge procedures represent a significant concern for energy infrastructure investors who face legal challenges years after receiving federal approval. Reform measures aim to establish clearer timelines for legal challenges while preserving legitimate environmental review rights.

Federal court jurisdiction consolidation could reduce forum shopping for environmental challenges while ensuring appropriate judicial review continues. Concentrated jurisdiction creates more predictable legal processes for major energy infrastructure projects.

Investment protection through regulatory stability provisions encourages private sector infrastructure investment by reducing post-approval regulatory uncertainty. These protections balance environmental review rights with investment security needs.

What Economic Impacts Can Industry Expect from Comprehensive Reform?

Economic analysis of permitting reform in U.S. energy sector suggests significant investment acceleration and job creation potential across energy-producing regions. Reform benefits would flow through construction employment, operational jobs, and increased tax revenues for federal and state governments.

Investment Flow Acceleration and Capital Deployment

Private sector confidence depends heavily on regulatory predictability, which current permitting processes fail to provide. Streamlined timelines would encourage infrastructure investment by reducing regulatory risk premiums that currently discourage project development.

Infrastructure investment multiplier effects amplify direct construction spending through supply chain purchases, equipment manufacturing, and service sector expansion. Energy infrastructure projects create particularly strong multiplier effects due to high capital requirements and specialised equipment needs.

Regional economic development benefits concentrate in areas with significant energy resources and infrastructure development potential. Rural communities often benefit substantially from energy infrastructure projects through construction employment and long-term tax revenue increases.

Consumer Cost Implications and Energy Affordability

Energy infrastructure development affects consumer costs through improved supply capacity and market competition. Additional pipeline capacity reduces transportation bottlenecks that can create regional price disparities for natural gas and electricity.

Longanecker noted that permitting delays create real economic consequences for American families through higher energy costs and elevated manufacturing expenses. ""Streamlined approvals could reduce these cost pressures through faster infrastructure deployment,"" he emphasised.

Long-term energy affordability benefits from improved infrastructure capacity outweigh short-term implementation costs. Enhanced energy transportation and generation capacity typically reduces consumer costs over infrastructure asset lifespans.

How Does Growing AI and Data Centre Demand Drive Reform Urgency?

Artificial intelligence development and data centre expansion create unprecedented electricity demand growth, adding urgency to energy infrastructure permitting reform. These technologies require reliable baseload power that current grid infrastructure cannot provide without significant expansion.

Exponential Power Consumption Growth from Digital Infrastructure

Data centre electricity consumption projections indicate dramatic increases through 2030, driven by artificial intelligence computational requirements and expanding digital services. This demand growth exceeds current grid capacity in many regions, requiring substantial infrastructure investment.

Natural gas generation provides the reliable baseload power essential for data centre operations, making natural gas infrastructure development critical for supporting digital economy growth. Permitting delays that restrict natural gas capacity could limit American technological competitiveness.

Grid stability challenges arise from concentrated high-demand facilities that stress regional transmission systems. Current permitting processes slow the infrastructure development needed to support these new electricity demands.

Technology Sector Advocacy for Regulatory Modernisation

Corporate energy procurement strategies increasingly focus on reliable electricity supply for data operations, creating technology sector interest in energy infrastructure development. Major technology companies now actively advocate for streamlined energy permitting to secure necessary power supplies.

Longanecker specifically highlighted growing power needs from AI-driven data centres as increasing demand for U.S. natural gas production. This technological demand shift creates new constituencies supporting energy infrastructure development.

International competitiveness concerns arise when regulatory delays limit American capacity to support advanced technology development. Countries with more efficient permitting processes could attract technology investment that requires substantial energy infrastructure.

What Challenges Could Derail Federal Permitting Reform Implementation?

Reform implementation faces significant obstacles despite legislative progress and industry support. Complex federal-state regulatory relationships, environmental organisation opposition, and institutional resistance could limit reform effectiveness.

State-Federal Regulatory Coordination Complexities

Overlapping jurisdiction between federal and state agencies creates coordination challenges that could limit reform benefits. Energy projects often require both federal and state approvals, meaning federal streamlining provides limited advantages if state processes remain slow.

Environmental justice concerns in disadvantaged communities require careful consideration during streamlined review processes. Reform implementation must address community concerns without recreating lengthy review processes that defeat efficiency objectives.

Tribal consultation requirements for projects affecting indigenous lands represent another coordination challenge requiring sensitive handling. These consultations serve important sovereignty recognition purposes while potentially affecting project timelines.

Environmental Group Opposition and Legal Challenge Strategies

Environmental organisations oppose aspects of permitting reform they believe could weaken environmental protection standards. This opposition creates political pressure against reform implementation and potential legal challenges to streamlined processes.

Litigation strategies could target specific aspects of reformed permitting procedures, potentially creating new delays through court challenges. Environmental groups have extensive experience using judicial review to slow energy infrastructure development.

Alternative reform proposals from conservation organisations focus on renewable energy prioritisation rather than technology-neutral streamlining. These alternative approaches compete with comprehensive reform objectives.

How Does U.S. Permitting Reform Compare to International Best Practices?

International comparisons reveal that many countries achieve faster energy infrastructure development through more efficient permitting processes. These examples provide models for potential American reform while highlighting implementation challenges alongside broader mining industry evolution trends.

European Union's Integrated Infrastructure Planning Model

Single-window approval systems in several EU countries consolidate environmental reviews under unified coordination, reducing duplicative processes that delay projects. These systems maintain environmental protection while improving process efficiency.

Cross-border project coordination mechanisms facilitate international energy infrastructure development within EU frameworks. These coordination systems provide models for interstate project management within American federal systems.

Renewable energy priority corridors in European countries demonstrate streamlined approvals for strategic infrastructure. While focused on renewable energy rather than technology-neutral approaches, these systems show streamlining possibilities.

Canada's Impact Assessment Modernisation Framework

Indigenous consultation integration within Canadian environmental assessment represents a model for addressing similar American requirements involving tribal nations. Canada's approach balances consultation requirements with process efficiency.

Provincial-federal coordination mechanisms in Canada provide examples of managing overlapping jurisdictions that parallel American state-federal coordination challenges. These systems demonstrate institutional solutions for multi-level governance.

Timeline certainty provisions in Canadian systems protect investor interests while maintaining environmental review integrity. These investor protection measures could inform American reform implementation approaches.

What Implementation Timeline and Milestones Should Industry Track?

Reform implementation will occur gradually through legislative passage, agency rulemaking, and operational changes. Industry participants should monitor specific milestones that indicate implementation progress and effectiveness.

Short-Term Regulatory Changes and Agency Preparations

FERC rule finalisation schedules will indicate agency readiness to implement streamlined procedures for natural gas and transmission projects. These administrative changes can proceed independently of comprehensive legislative reform.

DOE permitting pilot programs could provide early demonstrations of reformed procedures for renewable energy and critical mineral projects. Pilot results will inform broader implementation approaches and identify necessary adjustments.

Congressional action timelines for comprehensive legislation remain uncertain as the bill moves to Senate consideration. Industry should monitor committee activity and sponsor statements indicating legislative progress.

Long-Term Infrastructure Development Pipeline Acceleration

Project queue processing improvements at federal agencies will provide measurable indicators of reform effectiveness. Reduced backlogs and faster processing times will demonstrate reform benefits for infrastructure development.

Regional transmission planning integration with federal priorities could accelerate grid modernisation projects essential for renewable energy deployment and system reliability improvements. These planning processes operate on multi-year timelines requiring sustained coordination.

Investment commitment timelines and construction milestone tracking will ultimately measure reform success through actual infrastructure development acceleration. Private sector investment responses will indicate whether regulatory improvements achieve intended economic outcomes.

Conclusion: The Path Forward for Energy Infrastructure

The path forward for permitting reform in the U.S. energy sector depends on sustained political support, effective agency implementation, and successful coordination between multiple levels of government. While challenges remain significant, growing recognition of economic and security benefits from streamlined permitting creates momentum for meaningful change.

As Longanecker emphasised, comprehensive permitting reform in U.S. energy sector serves as a strategic imperative that unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures American energy leadership in global markets. The ultimate success of these efforts will depend on translating legislative intent into operational improvements that actually accelerate critical infrastructure development while maintaining appropriate environmental safeguards.

Pollution events at the Delaware City Refinery The Delaware City Refinery has had far more pollution events than any other entity in the state this year.","The Delaware City Refinery has experienced over 30 pollution incidents this year, with a recent event releasing about 1,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.

State environmental officials have deemed over 20 of the refinery's pollution events in 2025 as ""extremely hazardous.""

Just days ago, the state required fenceline sensors be installed at the refinery.

After more than 30 pollution incidents this year, over 20 of which the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control deemed ""extremely hazardous,"" another sulfur dioxide incident has occurred at the Delaware City Refinery.

According to Delaware Environmental Release Notification System reports, a large gas compressor ""tripped off line,"" causing around 1,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide to be released Dec. 14. ""The release is ongoing during the flare event,"" the report says.

A Dec. 15 report says a ""compressor failure is causing intermittent flaring at the refinery"" and releasing greater than 100 pounds per hour of sulfur dioxide when flaring. Refinery officials told DNREC the intermittent flaring ended that day, DNREC spokesperson Nikki Lavoie said.

A few days prior, on Dec. 12, in an event that may or may not be related to the sulfur dioxide releases, the refinery's hourly carbon monoxide limit was exceeded for six hours, according to the DERNS report. This event was not deemed ""extremely hazardous,"" like the sulfur dioxide releases, by DNREC.

Refinery officials did not immediately respond to a request for more information sent early Dec. 17.

The refinery is owned by PBF Energy, ""one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States,"" the company website says. The Delaware City refinery processes up to 180,000 barrels of crude oil per day, according to the website.

On Oct. 30, PBF reported its third quarter 2025 income from operations at $285.9 million. The company is run by Matt Lucey, president and CEO.

What are the effects of the pollutants released?

Sulfur dioxide is a gas. Short-term exposures can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing difficult, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. People with asthma, especially children, are most sensitive to these effects, the EPA says.

Carbon monoxide gas reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream, the EPA says. At high levels that are unlikely to occur outdoors, it can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death. Elevated levels of carbon monoxide outdoors are most concerning for people with certain types of heart disease, according to the EPA.

Pollution events at the Delaware City Refinery

The Delaware City Refinery has had far more pollution events than any other entity in the state this year.

On March 25, a carbon monoxide boiler at the refinery was shut down for about 10 hours, causing the emission of roughly 262,185 pounds carbon monoxide, 38,145 pounds of sulfur dioxide emissions and other chemicals. DNREC found the refinery to have violated four administrative laws and permit conditions in that incident, which was caused by employee error, according to the notice of violation. This event was not deemed ""extremely hazardous.""

Between May 25 and June 11, an issue with the same carbon monoxide boiler caused the refinery to emit hundreds of tons more sulfur dioxide (about 470 tons total) than it is permitted to release in an entire year, along with a slew of other chemicals. The refinery violated seven administrative laws and permit conditions in that incident, a notice of violation said. This event was deemed ""extremely hazardous.""

While DNREC has issued notices of violations to the refinery for the above events, fines have not been assessed thus far. Numerous other pollution events have occurred at the refinery this year that have not, or at least not yet, been addressed by notices of violations.

On Oct. 17, over 100 pounds of hydrogen sulfide and about 2,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide were released during a 15-minute flaring event at the refinery, DERNS says.

On Nov. 27, the refinery reported a release of butane ""equal to 1,000 pounds"" per hour occurred, caused by a mechanical failure, according to DERNS. However, following an internal investigation, the refinery reported Dec. 12 that the release occurred for 19 hours between Nov. 26 and 27. In that instance, refinery employees used handheld detection devices to determine the source of the leak, the DERNS report says.

Because the butane release ""was significantly more extensive than initially reported,"" a DNREC news release said, the department demanded the refinery install fenceline sensors. There likely was and is no public health concern due to the butane release, but the sensors are needed because ""the incident occurred for a significant period before refinery operators were aware of it"" and ""the public had no opportunity at the time to evaluate potential impacts from the release while it continued,"" the news release said.

The following ""extremely hazardous"" incidents also occurred at the refinery this year but have not been the subject of notices of violations or fines.

In an Aug. 2 incident, about 94 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released due to a ""compressor failure.""

In a June 27 incident, 100 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released ""due to a mechanical failure.""

In a Jan. 25 incident, there was ""a release of (carbon monoxide) over 1,000 parts per minute within a one-hour period.""","https://www.delawareonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/03/PWIL/84015991007-p-03-delaware-refinery.jpg?crop=3399,1912,x0,y177&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-19 12:59:21.383587

Moving Forward By strengthening its local supply chains and investing in U.S. skills and manufacturing, the energy industry can enhance its resilience, competitiveness, and contribution to national growth.","U.S. trade and immigration policies are reshaping the competitive environment and labor market for American energy companies. While many analyses of the new administration’s policy regime have explored tariffs or immigration separately, none has modeled their combined effects. Using our global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we assessed the long-run economic effects of these policies in tandem—effects both on the U.S. national economy and specific U.S. industries.

There is a long-standing consensus among economists about the adverse aggregate effects of increasing tariffs and reducing labor supply. Over time, tariffs introduce inefficiencies by raising the costs of goods and reducing the competition faced by domestic businesses. Reduced immigration limits the overall number of available workers, raising labor costs for businesses and, ultimately, prices for consumers.

Such adverse aggregate-level outcomes, however, do not necessarily hold for all industries. When it comes to the U.S. oil and gas industry, our analysis shows a clear picture: Trump administration efforts to reduce the number of undocumented workers and raise tariff rates will likely combine to reinforce the domestic competitiveness of U.S. oil and gas, boost domestic oil and gas manufacturing, and expand opportunities for U.S.-based suppliers and workers.

For oil and gas companies, service providers, and manufacturers, the coming years represent an opportunity to grow and visibly consolidate their contribution to domestic energy and economic security. For community and state leaders, the challenge and opportunity is to develop reliable hubs of skilled domestic labor attractive to oil and gas employers. Workforce development, vocational training, and targeted incentives could bolster the number of people entering the workforce and draw investment to geographic areas prepared to respond.

U.S. Oil and Gas Set to Benefit

Our modeling shows the U.S. oil and gas industry is set to expand as a result of these policy changes, leading to significant increases in domestic spending. Annual output is projected to rise by $7.6 billion (+2.1 percent), accompanied by an increase of 3,200 jobs (+2.6 percent). This growth will generate an additional $4.1 billion (+3.1 percent) in annual purchases of U.S.-made goods and services.

The following chart summarizes the net effect of Trump administration policy changes on sales and employment in the oil and gas industry, breaking down the anticipated impacts in terms of immigration policy effects—assumed to result in a reduction of approximately 4.5 percent in the U.S. low-skilled labor supply by 2028—and tariff policy effects.

Our analysis shows that as imported inputs become less cost-competitive, oil and gas companies will be able to expand supplier networks and source more domestically, reducing dependency on overseas markets and supporting American manufacturing.

In this new policy landscape, oil and gas companies have a chance to broaden supplier networks, expand investment in U.S. goods and skills, and diversify their procurement within the United States. For U.S. regions, especially those with advanced manufacturing or skilled labor bases, this is a moment to attract new energy-related investment. Targeted policy tools such as tax credits, infrastructure upgrades, and workforce training programs could ensure these benefits are widely distributed. Economic development officials at the regional, state, or municipal level have an immediate opportunity to identify where these gains are most likely to materialize and ensure that suppliers, workforce programs, and infrastructure are ready to support them.

Local Supply Chain Participation Is Geographically Uneven, But Growing

As the oil and gas industry expands its spending and investment in the US, the next question becomes where those opportunities will take root and how the benefits of growth can be more geographically distributed. Our state-level analysis of 2023 data from the IMPLAN Group shows that most oil and gas manufacturing purchases are concentrated in Texas and California, while service-based spending is distributed more evenly across the United States. As domestic spending increases, there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand supply chains across a wider set of states, creating a more competitive, resilient, and community-connected U.S. oil and gas industry.

Geographically diversifying supply chains would benefit U.S. energy companies in several ways. A broader manufacturing base would lower costs over time by increasing supplier competition, shortening transport distances, and reducing socioeconomic risk through stronger local engagement. Companies that source more broadly within the United States also stand to gain a greater social license to operate, as new investments translate into visible benefits for more communities.

With this significant scope for U.S. manufacturing diversification, local and regional authorities have a clear opportunity to position their workforces and industrial bases to participate in this growing national market. According to recent research, approximately 47 million people (about 14 percent of the U.S. population) live within 1 mile of fossil fuel energy infrastructure. These communities represent a ready network of potential partners and beneficiaries for expanded sourcing by a growing oil and gas industry; energy companies looking to extend their supply bases beyond traditional hubs are likely to find supportive partners among the states and municipalities positioned to host new facilities, train skilled workers, and capture the benefits of policy-driven domestic investment.

Moving Forward

By strengthening its local supply chains and investing in U.S. skills and manufacturing, the energy industry can enhance its resilience, competitiveness, and contribution to national growth. We will be monitoring the emerging policy and market environments to understand what they mean for companies, governments, and communities across the United States, helping our partners turn these insights into actionable strategies for smarter planning, better risk mitigation, and long-term value creation.

(""P&G"") has successfully completed a plug and abandonment project valued at USD $1.5 million as part of the conversion of a coal power plant into a natural gas-powered plant on a site located approximately 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, in Indiana County, PA.

During the redevelopment project, nine conventional gas wells were located on the site - all of which had fallen into ""marginal"" production status. P&G was brought in to permanently decommission these wells. This three-month undertaking was an essential step towards allowing the coal power plant conversion initiative to continue after being stalled due to the presence of these unplugged wells.

Throughout 2025, P&G has successfully executed on several opportunities to conduct infrastructure-improvement work, which differs from P&G's typical plug and abandonment jobs done for government and corporate clients. This type of work typically entails plugging wells for the specific purpose of unlocking business value (e.g., enabling new commercial builds to take place, mitigating ongoing costs from non-hazardous wells, etc.). Earlier this year, P&G completed these types of projects for clients that include a major defence/aerospace contractor, as well as a global e-commerce conglomerate.

Ed Longanecker, president of TIPRO, said permitting reform is essential for the U.S. energy sector to meet growing domestic and international demand.
He said prolonged federal reviews have delayed critical infrastructure projects, with broader economic impacts.
Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs,” he said, adding that growing power needs from AI-driven data centers will further increase demand for U.S. natural gas.
“For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical,” Longanecker said.","(WO) — The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) welcomed passage of H.R. 4776, known as the SPEED Act, by the U.S. House of Representatives, calling the legislation a critical step toward reforming federal permitting for energy infrastructure.

The bill seeks to streamline environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, a process industry groups say has contributed to years-long delays for oil, natural gas and infrastructure projects. TIPRO has publicly supported the legislation, which now awaits action in the U.S. Senate.

Ed Longanecker, president of TIPRO, said permitting reform is essential for the U.S. energy sector to meet growing domestic and international demand.

“On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers,” Longanecker said.

He said prolonged federal reviews have delayed critical infrastructure projects, with broader economic impacts.

“For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges,” he said.

Longanecker also tied permitting delays to rising energy costs and future demand from data centers and artificial intelligence development.

“Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs,” he said, adding that growing power needs from AI-driven data centers will further increase demand for U.S. natural gas.

The SPEED Act—formally titled the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act—was introduced in July by House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and co-sponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME). The bill proposes clearer definitions for federal actions under NEPA, firm timelines for environmental reviews and limits on legal challenges after final agency decisions.

“For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical,” Longanecker said. “It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world.”

TIPRO urged the Senate to take up the legislation, though prospects for passage remain uncertain heading into 2026.",https://www.worldoil.com/media/oqvb2zsj/courthouse-325x180.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:01:44.407395

IREC recommends using the 2024 census data as a baseline for tracking job impacts, project slowdowns, or recovery, depending on how the market adjusts.","According to the 15th annual Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) “National Solar Jobs Census,” the U.S. solar industry employed 280,119 workers in 2024, roughly the same number as in 2023, marking a flat employment trend amid growing uncertainty for the sector.

When including those who spent a portion (but not the majority) of their time on solar-related work, total employment rises to 370,556 jobs. With battery storage jobs factored in, the broader solar + storage workforce reached 464,053 workers in 2024.

Breakdown of workforce and sector growth

The largest share of jobs, 178,713, were in installation and project development, nearly two-thirds of all solar employment.

Other segments included manufacturing (32,491 jobs), wholesale trade & distribution (34,625 jobs), and operations & maintenance (21,833 jobs).

Notably, battery/storage employment increased: clean-storage jobs grew 4% year‑over‑year, rising by 3,905 positions to a total of 93,497 workers in 2024.

The census draws from data collected from 42,800 U.S. energy‑sector firms (with roughly 10,900 providing full responses) during late 2024 and early 2025. This gives a comprehensive snapshot across all 50 states.

Why employment held steady and why uncertainty looms

The 2024 job figures come before the full impact of 2025’s major federal policy changes, including the repeal of some tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). IREC notes this year’s census provides a critical baseline to monitor how those changes will affect clean‑energy employment going forward.

Federal incentives and tax credits have long supported solar growth across installation, manufacturing, and distribution segments. As those supports shift, the economic feasibility of new projects may be tested, potentially impacting hiring, project pipelines, and overall market momentum.

Geographic and political patterns

Contrary to perceptions that solar jobs are concentrated in “blue” states, 2024 saw notable workforce growth in several traditionally Republican states:

Ohio — +5%

Georgia — +4.5%

Utah — +3.5%

Texas — +3% (solarpowerworldonline.com)

States with the largest overall solar employment remained California, Florida, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts. For the fourth consecutive year, Nevada led in solar jobs per capita.

Broader context: solar and storage remain among the biggest clean‑energy employers

Even with employment leveling off, solar (and solar + storage) remains one of the largest clean‑energy employers in the United States. The sector still supports more jobs than coal and is second only to energy efficiency among clean-energy fields.

In a 2025 analysis, some industry observers noted that while total renewable‑energy employment in the U.S. remains robust, growth has moderated compared with previous years — reflecting both broader economic headwinds and policy uncertainty.

What’s next: Why 2025 and beyond are critical

With the OBBBA and related policy changes now in effect, 2025 may be a turning point for solar employment. IREC recommends using the 2024 census data as a baseline for tracking job impacts, project slowdowns, or recovery, depending on how the market adjusts.

Key factors to watch:

Whether reduced incentives lead to project cancellations or delays

How storage deployment and new technologies offset disruptions in solar installation work

Regional shifts in solar investment and state-level policy support

,Clean Energy ,2025-12-19 15:55:26+00:00,Electrek,US wind growth picks up speed as power demand surges | Electrek,"Michelle Lewis, Fred Lambert, Peter Johnson, Micah Toll, Seth Weintraub",,,,,https://electrek.co/2025/12/18/us-wind-growth-picks-up-speed-as-power-demand-surges/,"That kind of late-year rush is typical for wind projects, which tend to reach completion toward the end of the calendar year.
Power demand takes off At the same time, the need for new power is growing fast.
Onshore wind: Western states lead Onshore wind continues to do the heavy lifting.
Arkansas recently brought its first utility-scale onshore wind farm online with Cordelio’s Crossover Wind (pictured).
“US wind turbine pricing is experiencing unprecedented uncertainty as conflicting market and regulatory forces interact,” said Garcia da Fonseca.","After a sluggish stretch, US wind is heading into a pivotal moment, with a near-term rebound colliding with rising power demand, tariffs, and stubborn permitting bottlenecks.

US wind power: the next five years

The US is expected to add more than 7 gigawatts (GW) of new wind capacity in 2025, a 36% increase from this year, according to the latest US Wind Energy Monitor report from Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

That matters now because the US power grid is under mounting pressure, just as new generation has become harder to build. Electricity demand is rising for the first time in years, mainly driven by data centers and other large loads, while wind developers are navigating higher turbine costs, tariff uncertainty, and permitting delays. How quickly projects can move from the pipeline to completion over the next few years will shape whether wind can help keep the lights on and power prices in check.

Over the longer term, the outlook is steady but increasingly back‑loaded. The report still sees 46 GW of new wind capacity coming online between 2025 and 2029. What has changed is timing. More projects are now expected to reach completion in the middle of the decade, with 2026 and 2027 shaping up to be especially busy years at 10.7 GW and 12.7 GW, respectively, as projects move through the development pipeline.

That shift helps explain why installations lagged earlier this year. Wind additions in Q3 came in at 932 megawatts (MW), about 23% below forecasts. But activity is picking up fast. Developers have about 3.8 GW queued for Q4 2025 alone, which would account for 52% of the year’s total expected capacity. That kind of late-year rush is typical for wind projects, which tend to reach completion toward the end of the calendar year.

There are also signs of life on the manufacturing side. US turbine order intake rebounded in Q3 to pre–Trump’s big bill act levels, with more than 2 GW of firm commitments, the strongest quarter in the past nine months, and a 79% jump from the previous quarter. But you wouldn’t know it, because turbine makers are increasingly keeping project details close to their chests, and much of the qualifying “start-of-construction” activity is happening off-site through component manufacturing.

Looking further out, the report flags a noticeable slowdown toward the end of the decade. Capacity additions in 2029 are expected to drop sharply following project cancellations and inactive designations, largely due to permitting challenges and broader development constraints.

Power demand takes off

At the same time, the need for new power is growing fast.

After a decade of mostly flat electricity demand, US power demand is now expected to grow by around 3% per year through 2029, compared to just 0.7% over the previous decade. Data centers alone are expected to drive about 59 GW of the roughly 90 GW increase in peak demand. That kind of round-the-clock load makes more wind power a necessity.

“The US power market is facing mounting strain after a decade of flat demand, with utilities committing to 160 GW of large-load additions,” said Leila Garcia da Fonseca, Wood Mackenzie’s director of research. “This represents a significant opportunity for wind energy, which benefits from strengthened economic fundamentals and a compelling business case driven by its competitively low LCOE.”

But she also warned that higher turbine costs and policy uncertainty could slow down progress in the middle of the decade.

Onshore wind: Western states lead

Onshore wind continues to do the heavy lifting. The five-year onshore outlook remains unchanged at 39.8 GW of new capacity, and the 2025–2027 pipeline already has turbine orders in place for every project. More than 60% of that three-year capacity has either been commissioned or is already under construction.

Western states are leading the charge. Wyoming, New Mexico, and neighboring states are expected to account for about 34% of onshore activity over that period. Big projects are driving the numbers, including Pattern Energy’s 3.5 GW SunZia project in New Mexico, which is set to make the company the top wind installer in 2026, and Invenergy’s 998 MW Towner Energy Center in Colorado, the single largest project expected to come online in 2027.

Wind is also spreading into new territory. Arkansas recently brought its first utility-scale onshore wind farm online with Cordelio’s Crossover Wind (pictured).

Repowering older wind farms remains another bright spot. Wood Mackenzie expects 18 repowering projects to add about 2.5 GW of capacity over the next three years.

Offshore wind: progress, but pressure

Offshore wind is a different story. Wood Mackenzie expects offshore installations to slow in Q4 2025 due to harsh winter weather, pushing some capacity into 2026. Still, projects already under construction are making progress. Vineyard Wind connected 15 turbines in Q3 and delivered 200 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity over the first nine months of the year.

“US offshore wind shows diverging momentum,” Garcia da Fonseca said. “Projects under construction with commercial operation dates in 2026 continue to hit key milestones, but post-2027 developments face potential delays amid constrained wind turbine installation vessel capacity, driving delays and contract terminations.”

The offshore sector is also under growing financial strain – and let’s not forget political attack from the Trump administration – with delays and contract terminations weighing on late-decade projects.

Tariffs are making turbines more expensive

Tariffs remain one of the biggest wild cards for the US wind industry. Wood Mackenzie expects tariffs to push turbine costs higher in 2026 before easing in later years. Overall, US onshore wind capital spending is projected to rise by about 5% through 2029.

“US wind turbine pricing is experiencing unprecedented uncertainty as conflicting market and regulatory forces interact,” said Garcia da Fonseca. While domestic manufacturing capacity could eventually bring prices down, tariffs on raw materials and key components are expected to keep costs elevated in the near term.

Last week, the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee unilaterally voted to disapprove $645 million in work projects.
Although its status after the House moved to kill work project funding last week was unclear.
She also acknowledged that it was tough to determine a path forward on remaining legislation following the House’s move last week to defund hundreds of millions of dollars in work projects.
During session on Tuesday, the House passed SB 685, SB 686, SB 687, SB 688, SB 689, SB 690, and SB 699.","The Michigan Public Service Commission on Thursday unanimously approved contracts for DTE Energy Company to power the upcoming hyperscale data center in Saline Township while imposing various conditions on the agreement.

The crowd erupted when public comment was not taken before the decision to approve the contracts, with crowd members calling out that they don’t know the details of the contract. The commission approved the contracts on an ex-parte basis, which means it is not taking input from other parties.

Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remain on opposing sides of the discourse on the data center’s development. Whitmer championed the move, and Nessel claimed the commission, whose members are appointed by Whitmer, has cut corners on the deal.

Mike Byrne, chief operating officer at the commission, said the terms of the contract, which would pay for 1.33 gigawatts of energy over a 15-year period, would include a power supply agreement that would generate an affordability benefit to DTE’s other customers to spread the company’s fixed costs.

He said while many individuals petition the commission to start a contested case, the order would not result in an increase to rates.

Other parts of the conditional approval include a minimum contract duration of 19 years, compared to the standard agreement of five years, a minimum billing demand of 80% of the contracted electricity instead of the standard 50-60%, even if the entire amount of electricity is not used, and a termination payment of up to 10 years’ worth of billing demand if the facility stops operating earlier than contracted.

The commission has also directed the company to file a renewable energy plan, clean energy plan, analysis of the utility’s capacity compared to the data center’s usage need, and an energy waste reduction plan.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick said during comment after anger from the crowd that this was a conditional approval and that their decision was meant to decide if DTE was being “reasonable and prudent.”

She said she was comfortable voting to approve the contracts since their subject matter is within PSC jurisdiction, which is energy supply, not other considerations like water usage, noise pollution, or the merits of artificial intelligence generally.

“The power supply agreement and energy storage agreement are well negotiated, solid contracts,” Peretick said. “They show a net financial benefit to DTE’s other customers of approximately $300 million per year. That is a real cost savings at a time when affordability is so important.”

Peretick said the approval is contingent on DTE agreeing to bear all risks of costs, and if it turns out to be “overly optimistic,” DTE can refile the case as contested.

Commissioner Shaquila Myers said the case was meant to ensure there was sufficient power to serve all customers and individual customers were not subsidizing the data center.

She said all risks associated with collateral will be taken on by DTE, not the customers, and the commission can at any time go back and disapprove of the contracts.

Chair Dan Scripps said PSC approval on ex parte basis is a normal process for the commission. He said he believed the commission is holding itself to a higher standard, saying members don’t take things on faith and want all the facts in front of them.

He said he knows of similar contracts happening in other states, and he puts the DTE contracts on par with or better than other utility contracts.

He said the commission considered the idea of AI as a bubble, saying that even “if this is all overblown, and the load doesn’t materialize,” the customers would still be protected.

Throughout board comment, audience members left yelling about government being in the pocket of big business and worrying about the health of the community with the center.

Byrne also said the commission would approve future applications for battery storage to meet the electricity demand of the data center.

Part of the contract also says in an energy emergency, the data center’s load would be interrupted before interrupting other customers’ service, Byrne said.

The meeting included over an hour of public comments.

Nichole Keway Biber, an organizer for Clean Water Action, said the contract was a “long list of promises of conditionalities” and that the commission should change their name from a public service commission to who she said they actually serve: the governor who appointed them, elected politicians who are acting on returns of investment from their campaign contributors, the chambers of commerce, the big bosses of labor, and union workers and the “tech bro oligarchy.”

Justin Macauley, another commenter, said he didn’t believe the claims that zero costs would be shifted to ratepayers, saying billions for new lines of power don’t just vanish, landing on “families already stretched thin.”

The commissioners did not take questions from reporters after the meeting.

Attorney General Dana Nessel has criticized the commission and called for it to go through a contested case process.

The one public comment hearing before the decision received mixed reviews across the nearly 5,000 public comments.

After the vote, Nessel released a statement saying that while she was relieved to hear the commission had placed some conditions on the DTE application, she was extremely disappointed in the decision to not hold a contested case hearing and wanted more clarity on what the original contracts looked like.

“This secret contract still leaves Michiganders scrounging for hidden and vital details that could harm ratepayers should these AI corporations leave, move out of state, or simply go bankrupt,” Nessel said. “None of the conditions proposed by the commission will bring these terms into public view, including what exit fee provisions might be in effect before December 2027. Rushing approval through an ex parte process lets DTE brush past important questions and shields the utility from the transparency the public deserves, and review by essential consumer protection organizations and offices such as mine, which I take personally as an elected official charged with protecting the consumers of this state.”

On the other hand, Whitmer has trumpeted the project, wanting to move the contracts along quickly.

Whitmer, after the approval, said in a statement the Stargate project “cements our state as the place to pioneer cutting-edge technology and change the world.

“It is the largest economic project in state history, creating 2,500 good-paying union construction jobs, more than 450 good-paying permanent jobs, and more than 1,500 jobs in the surrounding community,” she said, going on to claim it will be one of the most advanced data centers ever built.

“With this project, we are ensuring we can grow our economy while also protecting our environment and precious natural resources,” Whitmer continued. “That’s why we worked with these companies to ensure that Stargate complies with Michigan law and will protect Michigan’s air, land, and water. I’ll keep working with anyone to create good-paying jobs and build a bright future for our state.”

Rep. Morgan Foreman, D-Pittsfield Township, whose legislative district includes Saline Township, released a statement saying she was disappointed in the decision. She said the commission was robbing the people of her community to ask questions and speak with the companies involved.

“I have said from the beginning that approving these contracts without full transparency would set a dangerous precedent,” Foreman said. “This is not ‘doing business with’ a community, which implies a mutual and reciprocal relationship with residents and neighbors; it is forcing themselves onto us, without discussion or review.”

The Michigan League of Conservation Voters said in a statement the state had an opportunity to set a high standard for data center development but fell short.

“The very nature of this conditional approval underscores why Michiganders need confidence that their bills won’t rise and our affordable clean energy future is protected,” Lisa Wozniak, the president of the league, said. “While these conditions attempt to hold DTE accountable, moving such a massive data center forward with limited expert review and heavily redacted agreements still raises serious concerns.”

Members of the Senate voted on Tuesday evening on a supplemental appropriations bill that would reinstate about $634 million in funding for work projects that were cut last week by the House Appropriations Committee.

The Senate in a 23-13 vote passed HB 4576, which contains $634 million ($351.5 million General Fund) for the 2025-26 fiscal year.

As passed, it would largely offset the $645 million in funding that House Republicans disapproved in work projects last week, which infuriated Democrats as well as some GOP lawmakers while blindsiding recipients of the funding who were confused as to how their projects were called waste, fraud, and abuse.

Five Republicans sided with the Democrats to restore the funding: Sen. Jon Bumstead of North Muskegon, Sen. John Damoose of Harbor Springs, Sen. Mark Huizenga of Walker, Sen. Ed McBroom of Vulcan, and Sen. Michael Webber of Rochester Hills. One Democrat, Sen. Sylvia Santana of Detroit, was absent and did not vote.

The vote came moments before Senate Democrats announced they sent a letter to Attorney General Dana Nessel seeking an opinion on the legality of the House’s use of the rarely used provision in the Management and Budget Act to enact the sweeping work project cuts.

In the letter, Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony, D-Lansing, asked Nessel if the provision in the Management and Budget Act is constitutional.

“The scope of this action is unprecedented, and as such, it has raised serious questions about the legality of Section 451a of the Act and the committee’s application of that language,” Anthony wrote. “To that end, I ask for your opinion as to the following question: Whether the provision in MCL 18.1451a(3), allowing either the Senate or House Appropriations committees to disapprove work projects designated by the State Budget Office, violates the Michigan Constitution?”

Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, told reporters that Senate Democrats have been weighing their options to respond since last week’s move by the House. She said it took time to figure out exactly what the House had done so the supplemental could be crafted to accurately reflect the proposed restoration of funding.

“We thought it was very important to right that wrong, and really it’s about the people who are impacted,” Brinks said. “It’s incredibly important that we make those people whole and that we can help restore the trust that they should be able to have when the state makes a promise that they get certain funding to do certain things for the public good.”

Brinks said Senate Democrats have been clear on what they think of the House cuts and her hope is that House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, gets the message.

She added that she is not interested in negotiating the supplemental and that the funding needs to be restored.

As to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s silence on the work project cuts over the last week, Brinks said the governor has a stake in the cut items.

“She was an active participant in negotiating this budget and ensuring that these dollars get to the entities for whom they were intended,” Brinks said.

Brinks said it was disappointing to see the House take the approach on work projects that it did last week.

“Having worked with them for a year now, it was not a move that should surprise anyone, seeing their willingness to do that kind of damage, but it is a positive thing that there are at least some things that we can work together on,” Brinks said. “Actually, I’m quite proud of my caucus for being willing to set some of those other feelings aside and do some of the things that do matter to people that are depending on us to come here, represent them and move legislation.”

She explained that the roughly $11 million difference between the supplemental and what the House disallowed was due to that money being in boilerplate, so that funding could not be disallowed.

In a statement, Hall took aim at Senate Democrats and was dismissive of their vote to reinstate the funding.

“The Senate Democrats are so addicted to pork and their secret slush funds that they just voted to reinstate the waste, fraud and abuse that House Republicans fought to eliminate,” Hall said. “Ultimate Lansing insiders like Sarah Anthony continue to do the bidding of lobbyists and the radical left special interests. Not the taxpayers. This isn’t surprising at all.”

House Speaker Matt Hall on Tuesday continued to deflect and defend his caucus eliminating hundreds of millions of dollars in work projects.

Last week, the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee unilaterally voted to disapprove $645 million in work projects.

The total amount cut, however, remains unclear because how much money was already spent and what programs, specifically, were affected is unknown.

Hall, R-Richland Township, faulted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s administration for the uncertainty.

“The Whitmer administration cannot really produce for us what a lot of these programs are, how much of the money has been spent, what’s out the door, what isn’t, who the beneficiaries are,” he said. “The governor has not been able to provide a lot of those answers to us or to the media, and I think that is a symptom of the pork spending being out of control.”

Hall’s comments came during a press conference that ended with protesters outside the Speaker’s Library, who could be heard chanting on the livestream. Tuesday also saw a press conference from the Legislative Black Caucus and a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing slamming the cuts and the Senate moved to reverse the House action via a supplemental.

Hall alleged that much of the money for work projects was going to lobbyists for bonuses and on “secret pork spending.”

“You’re seeing the symptoms of that with this $10 billion slush fund and all the hundreds of millions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse,” he said. “You see projects that they snuck in the budget in the middle of the night, and nobody knew what they were. … A lot of these pork spending projects, they’re taking that money, and they’re paying lobbyists win bonuses, and they hide it under things like association management.”

Legislatively directed spending items were out of control, Hall said, and the process needs to be reformed. He said departments were creating “slush funds” with unspent money.

“They get to hold on to it indefinitely for years and years, with no legislative oversight,” he said. “So, what we’re doing here, we’re denying it, and now we’re forcing a negotiation.”

Hall again said that many state departments did not send House Republicans information about work projects until last week.

“In some cases, we kept those priorities from being cut because the department gave us the justifications,” he said. “I was never trying to disrupt really critical things that would create cataclysmic problems.”

An example of that, Hall said, was Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve funding. That money included appropriations to Dow Chemical, located in the 35th Senate District, which is an open seat that Republicans are hoping to flip in the upcoming special election next year.

The State Budget Office, however, sent more than 500 pages of detailed information to fiscal agencies about work projects, along with a summary to legislators on Nov. 14. Departments also compiled an additional 75 pages of documentation, and several departments met with Rep. Tom Kuhn, R-Troy, the week of Nov. 14. Departments were not asked to provide additional testimony.

“Departments complied with requests from Speaker Hall and House Appropriations Committee members, including providing more than 500 pages of materials on work projects. This documentation made clear that disapproval would mean voting to halt funding for local road, bridge and water infrastructure repairs, senior centers, job creation efforts, and other commonsense measures,” a statement from State Budget Director Jen Flood said. “While the governor and Senate Democrats are working to create jobs and lower costs for Michiganders, this was a vote to raise costs and harm some of our most vulnerable Michiganders.”

Worthwhile projects would have an opportunity to have their funding restored, Hall said.

“We have an obligation to put a pause on this, to force a conversation on our timeline next year,” he said. “When we see good programs that are justified, we’ll but those back in in a deal.”

Hall went on to say that it was not the responsibility of House Republicans to contact programs that were losing funding, and that it was on departments to have a better understanding of what money was spent.

As for Senate Republicans, like Sen. John Damoose, R-Harbor Springs, that had a problem with the cuts? Hall called them “budget traitors.”

During a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting on Tuesday, Damoose questioned whether these cuts would incentivize organizations to spend down money as fast as possible, which could open the door for more waste.

Hall brushed the concern aside.

“I think you start to see who the Republican budget traitors are, the people shove their pork into department budgets and are pissed off that their pork got cut,” he said. “What you should do is you should negotiate up front for the multi-year programs, like what we did in the ’26 budget, and then it should be the exception to the rule.”

In the future, Hall said that the confusion regarding what was cut won’t be a problem because of the new transparency laws requiring legislatively directed spending items to be introduced with a sponsor and a clear beneficiary 45 days before the budget is passed.

Ultimately, it was not House Republicans responsibility to know what was being cut, but rather on departments to know what is being spent, Hall said, and they don’t know because “spending is so out of control.”

“What you’re saying to me is, should you approve the spending of dollars when they won’t sufficiently justify what the use is?” he said. “And the answer to that is no.”

The House and Senate moved some legislation Tuesday as part of a deal to get a flurry of bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the last days of session.

Senate Democrats acknowledged there was a deal in place to move several bill packages before the end of the year. Although its status after the House moved to kill work project funding last week was unclear.

A House Republican source told Gongwer News Service there is an agreement between the House and the Senate to move 18 bill packages before the end of the year. The legislation will split public acts between the House and the Senate.

The list includes legislation from both chambers to regulate online ticket sales, update the liquor codes, and several other regulatory reform bills.

Most of the bills the House passed during Tuesday’s session were part of the agreement. The Senate passed fewer bills, and also moved a supplemental reversing work project cuts made by the House last week, but Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said the Senate could be back Thursday.

The Senate is not taking attendance on Wednesday.

Brinks told reporters the Senate will determine if there is any additional business to take care of on Thursday.

“There are some things that been in a queue for a long time,” Brinks said. “We have been working to try and un-stick some bills, so we’d be happy to see some of those things move.”

Brinks said some bills that have been the subject of discussion with the House were passed in the Senate on Tuesday. She also acknowledged that it was tough to determine a path forward on remaining legislation following the House’s move last week to defund hundreds of millions of dollars in work projects.

“We had to really come back into the room and evaluate what it was our caucus was willing to do,” Brinks said.

During session on Tuesday, the House passed SB 685, SB 686, SB 687, SB 688, SB 689, SB 690, and SB 699.

The bills are designed to protect farmland and open space through agreements that restrict development and prove tax incentives for program participation. By enrolling for a minimum of 10 years, landowners may be entitled to certain income tax benefits.

SB 685 passed 102-3. Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers; Rep. Matt Maddock, R-Milford; and Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, voted no. SB 686 passed by the same margin and with the same opposition. SB 687, SB 688, and SB 689 passed 103-3. Carra, Maddock, and Wegela were, again, the only no votes. SB 690 passed 102-4. Carra, Maddock, Wegela and Rep. Ann Bollin, R-Brighton Township, voted no. The final bill in that package, SB 699, passed 103-3, with Carra, Maddock, and Wegela voting against it.

The House also passed SB 96, SB 97, and SB 98, which allow child care organizations to install temporary door locking devices in their buildings. Both bills passed unanimously.

SB 82, which would shield the personal information of Michigan judges, their families and households, was also part of the agreement. It passed the House 99-6. Carra, Rep. Joseph Fox, R-Freemont; Rep. Tom Kuhn, R-Troy; Maddock; Rep. Donni Steele, R-Orion; and Wegela voted no.

SB 23, which modifies the Land Division Act to allow for an increased number of parcel divisions also passed the House as part of the deal. It passed 97-5 with a substitute and will return to the Senate. Rep. Julie Brixie, D-Okemos; Rep. William Bruck, R-Erie; Rep. Peter Herzberg, D-Westland; Rep. Sharon MacDonell, D-Troy; Rep. Phil Skaggs, D-East Grand Rapids; Steele; Wegela; and Rep. Regina Weiss, D-Oak Park, voted no.

SB 25 also passed the House as part of the deal. The legislation allows motor vehicle repair facilities to operate an auxiliary facility under the same registration. It passed 102-3. Carra, Rep. Brad Paquette, R-Niles; and Wegela voted no.

The House also unanimously passed SB 95, which was not part of the agreement.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, R-Coldwater, prohibits hospitals from attempting to collect debts incurred during any period in which they were not in compliance with federal hospital price transparency laws and regulations.

The Senate for its part moved only a small number of House bills on Tuesday that may have been included in the deal.

One bill which passed was HB 4543, which would amend the Income Tax Act to update how the Department of Treasury makes its yearly inflation adjustment for the Home Heating Tax Credit, using the U.S. Consumer Price Index to account for inflation. The bill passed 31-4.

Also passing the Senate was HB 4836, which would create an opt-out waiver for the workforce readiness portion of the M-STEP. It passed 32-3. The accompanying Senate bill, SB 349, previously passed the House with a substitute. Senators voted 35-0 to concur in the House substitute.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-center-feature.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:59:46.211273

Permanence vs. ‘Tax Cliffs’

Speaking with Checkpoint, Acuna emphasized the significance of permanent tax provisions for long-term business planning, contrasting them with the uncertainty created by temporary changes and “tax cliffs.” The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) enacted July 4 includes permanent extensions to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions and its own temporary measures.

For major, multi-billion-dollar investments that have long-term horizons, legislative certainty is critical, said Acuna. Without that certainty, there is “this inability to engage in longer-term planning,” as looming cliffs are “infinitely” worse for business planning. The last tax reform package, the Inflation Reduction Act, was signed into law just three years prior to the OBBBA, and five years after the TCJA.

Frequent overhauls to tax laws, especially when there are swings in party control of Congress and the White House, can result “putting all of your hopes into the political fates and expecting Congress to act to provide taxpayer relief,” Acuna explained. “That is not a place you want to be, as we’ve seen in recent years.”

She pointed to the treatment of research and experimentation expenses under IRC § 174 and the business interest limitation under IRC § 163(j), where expired or changing rules made planning difficult. The permanence of many business provisions in the OBBBA, she noted, is a “major benefit to business.”

But the OBBBA also temporarily raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 before it reverts, and introduces income thresholds. This provision “just created a mini cliff in the tax policy space where you’re going to see the significant drop off in the SALT benefit,” Acuna expects.

Guidance Rollout and Engaging With Treasury

Despite a significant reduction in its workforce and the disruption of the longest government shutdown in history, the IRS and Treasury have begun issuing a “steady stream of guidance,” which Acuna called a “relief to taxpayers.”

Yet tax filing season is just around the corner. With that in mind, Acuna’s best advice for taxpayers and practitioners is to act immediately. “What we have been recommending to clients in particular, is … to start modeling sooner rather than later,” she stated. “If you’re waiting for guidance to even start, you’re already many steps behind.”

Acuna explained that Treasury is still drafting rules and taking feedback from the public. “They’re open to discuss potential problems and potential gaps … that need to be filled in upcoming guidance,” she said. “The time is now to … go and speak to Treasury to try to get some clarity,” especially when planning for the new law yields “counterintuitive results.” Put simply, the Department should know about issues taxpayers are facing so guidance can address them sooner rather than later.

Acuna acknowledged that practitioners might hesitate to approach Treasury, fearing an unfavorable interpretation of a rule. However, she advised that the risk of inaction is greater. While there is always an “analysis of whether or not to bring the issue” to regulators, she concluded that “more guidance is always better than less guidance.” She urged practitioners to seek clarity to avoid having their clients’ critical issues lost or unaddressed as Treasury finalizes its rules.

Also worth noting is that a reduced IRS workforce will directly impact the “sheer volume of controversies” the agency can handle, forcing it to prioritize certain issues for examination, she said. “It puts more emphasis on the prioritization of issues at exams.”

Client Education

Given the scale of the legislation, Acuna said the first step for practitioners is always to “analyze exposure.” For example, the law’s changes to the TCJA’s global intangible low-taxed income regime (now referred to as net controlled foreign corporation tested income) will impact taxpayers differently, depending on their unique facts and circumstances.

While the OBBBA is largely an “extenders package” rather than a creator of entirely new tax systems like the TCJA, the technical details and retroactive provisions will still pose challenges, Acuna cautioned. Practitioners should educate clients on the small technical issues, which she said are “usually what gives rise to controversy.” This will be especially true for areas where the IRS is likely to focus its limited examination resources, such as the clean energy sector.

“But fewer exam agents and less capability doesn’t always translate into better results for taxpayers,” Acuna clarified.",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-12-19 10:59:57.831031

New data from this year reveals that electric cars are no longer just a luxury for wealthy nations. Instead, emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America are now the ones adopting EVs the fastest. In 2019, only four countries saw electric cars take up more than 10% of their new car sales. By 2025, that number has jumped to 39 countries. A third of these leaders are now located outside of Europe.

China remains the giant in this field. This year, for the first time, more than 50% of all new cars sold in China were electric. But the real surprise is coming from its neighbors. Viet Nam's share of electric cars reached nearly 40% in 2025. That is double what it was just last year. For comparison, the European Union average is 26%, and the United Kingdom sits at 33%. Even Thailand has hit a milestone, with EVs making up 20% of its new car sales this year.

In Viet Nam, VinFast VF 3 has become the best-selling car in the country. This tiny ""mini-SUV"" is built for city life. It measures 10.47 ft long, 5.51 ft wide, and 5.31 ft tall. Despite its small size, it fits four people and offers a ground clearance of 7.5 inches. It uses an 18.64 kWh battery and can travel up to 130 miles on a single charge. It also charges quickly, going from 10% to 70% in just 36 minutes. In many markets, this car is expected to start at a price of around $20,000.

Other nations are using EVs to save money and clean their air. Ethiopia recently banned the import of gas-powered cars entirely. Because they have lots of water power for electricity, electric cars now make up 60% of their sales. In Nepal, that number is even higher at 76%. These countries want to stop buying expensive oil from other nations. Indonesia is also moving fast. Its EV sales share reached 15% this year, which is actually higher than the 7.3% share seen in the United States. Indonesia even gives tax breaks to companies like CATL and BYD to build batteries and cars locally.

Latin America is joining the race, too. Uruguay has reached a 27% share for electric cars, while Costa Rica is at 17%. Brazil and Mexico are now selling a higher percentage of EVs than Japan. In Brazil, driving an electric vehicle reduces the use of fossil fuels by 90% because the electricity comes from very clean sources. Popular models like the BYD Dolphin Mini (sold as Seagull or Surf in other markets) are helping. In Brazil, this car costs about R$115,800 (roughly $23,000). It has a 38 kWh battery and a range of about 174 miles. These prices make it easier for regular families to switch away from gas.

Countries like the US have recently cut back on tax credits, but the rest of the world is moving full speed ahead. Between January and October 2025, one out of every four cars sold globally was electric. This global shift is helping to create millions of new jobs. In Viet Nam alone, experts think the industry could create 6.5 million jobs by 2050. The era of the gasoline engine is fading, and the new leaders of the EV shift are appearing in places we might not have expected just a few years ago.",https://st.arenaev.com/news/25/12/new-leaders-take-the-wheel-of-the-global-ev-race/-828x414/arenaev_000.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:58:54.159008

In this series, we reveal how LNG demand and AI data centers could transform Permian gas into a primary revenue driver.","Energy Transfer (ET) picked up a G&P system in the Powder River Basin (PRB) when it bought Crestwood Equity in 2023 for $7.1B. Since then, the company’s growth machine has been squarely pointed at the Permian and Gulf Coast, leaving Wyoming as increasingly non-core.

The PRB assets include the Jackalope gathering system and the Bucking Horse I/II cryogenic plants in Converse County, WY (see map from ET). Jackalope includes ~180 miles of gathering line and primarily serves Continental Resources, Occidental Petroleum and Anschutz. The Bucking Horse plants have total processing capacity of 345 MMcf/d and deliver residue gas to Kinder Morgan’s (KMI) Wyoming Interstate system. East Daley’s “G&P System Analysis” dashboard in Energy Data Studio shows throughput of ~100 MMcf/d through the plants (see figure below).

Why the PRB assets screen as non-core:

Strategy mismatch. ET’s current spending is dominated by Permian gas/NGL expansions (processing at Red Lake/Badger, fractionation at Mont Belvieu), NGL terminal expansions at Nederland and Marcus Hook, and long-haul gas pipelines. The Powder River is not a focus of growth.

Marginal earnings impact. ET has guided to $16.1–16.5B of 2025 Adj. EBITDA, leaving the PRB system at well under 1% of the total. This is consistent with a divestible, niche position in ET’s large portfolio.

Outside core operations. Since the Crestwood deal closed, ET has expanded its Permian footprint, including the $3.25B WTG Midstream acquisition and its Permian crude/water JV with Sunoco. Wyoming has not factored into the company’s dealing.

Who would buy it?

Western Midstream (WES). WES expanded in the Powder River by buying Meritage Midstream, giving the company a large G&P footprint in Wyoming. The Jackalope/Bucking Horse assets would expand its footprint and create potential synergies for shared customers.

Tallgrass Energy. Tallgrass also operates Powder River midstream assets, including the nearby Casper and Douglas processing plants and Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission (TIGT). Folding in Jackalope/Bucking Horse could lift volumes on TIGT and strengthen one-stop midstream services in the basin.

What changes for ET: A sale would allow Energy Transfer to marginally delever while it continues to commit resources to Permian gas and NGL projects.

Investor Takeaway: The PRB system is a logical non-core candidate for ET — small, remote and overshadowed by Permian and Gulf Coast growth opportunities. A sale could unlock strategic value for the right buyer, with immaterial earnings impact to ET. – Jaxson Fryer Tickers: ET, KMI, WES.

Additionally in early 2026, EPA will address the 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle NOx rule.","Throughout the 2024 campaign, President Trump sent a very clear message to the U.S. auto industry: Under his leadership it would be revived. Biden-era vehicle policies were infeasible, unrealistic, and would not work either for American consumers or the auto industry.

Our predecessors believed they could force their climate agenda upon Americans and remove consumer choice. We saw this with their electric vehicle mandate, which Americans flat-out rejected. Implementing Trump’s agenda, the Environmental Protection Agency is taking a different approach.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made protecting and bringing back American auto jobs one of his five pillars for his Powering the Great American Comeback initiative. As the assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation, my team is delivering.

This year, we have announced significant proposals and actions to bring certainty back to industry and choice back to American families. We have done this while simultaneously following the law and furthering the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.

This includes the agency’s proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding and subsequent greenhouse gas vehicle rules. As 2026 approaches, the agency is working to build on its 2025 accomplishments.

On March 12, 2025, EPA launched the most consequential day of deregulation in agency history to reduce red tape and bring common sense back to rulemaking. In 2026, Americans can expect to see the reconsideration of two regulations — one pertaining to Model Year 2027 and Later Light-and Medium-Duty Vehicles, and the 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle NOx rule.

The Biden administration imposed the former regulation in an attempt to force electric vehicles upon American families. This utterly failed, as the Biden officials developing the regulation vastly overestimated the future share of electric vehicles in the market. Where they projected shares of electric vehicles to be 17 percent in 2026, the actual share is only about 9 percent. This left automakers scrambling to adapt to something their customers didn’t want.

The latter rule was no different. Starting in model year 2027, the Biden EPA would have hit truck companies, fleet owners, and individual truck drivers with a significant economic impact. The Trump EPA, in contrast, firmly believes we do not have to choose between fulfilling our core mission of protecting human health and the environment and boosting the economy.

Keeping promises is a very important principle to this administration. That is why, in early 2026, EPA will propose a two-year delay to the Biden administration’s Model Year 2027 and Later Light-and Medium-Duty Vehicles regulation. The agency is also working on a new rule for Model Year 2029 and beyond that better reflects reality, promotes consumer choice, and helps bring down prices.

Additionally in early 2026, EPA will address the 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle NOx rule. The agency is identifying strategic opportunities to streamline costs and reduce regulatory burdens.

One change we intend to propose will revise the Biden-era rule’s warranty provisions. This revision, if finalized, would reduce compliance costs by up to 50 percent. We are also considering an extension of what is known as “regulatory useful life.” This gets a bit into the weeds, but American truckers understand its significance. The gist is that the Biden administration’s changes increased the cost of engines — we intend to make engines cheaper and in turn lower the costs of the goods that trucks carry.

We are also looking into other changes that will increase choice and lower costs. Although the Trump administration would not have finalized the Biden standards, the required lead time within the Clean Air Act renders us unable to change the emissions standard itself.

At EPA, we are standing up for American families and businesses, while also doing our job to protect human health and the environment. This is a commitment we are proud to make and look forward to furthering on behalf of the president and the public in 2026.

Nel, a Norwegian energy company with over 100 years of experience, has recently announced it has taken a final investment decision on its new scaled-up next-generation alkaline electrolyser to reach 1 GW of capacity. The FID follows years of significant testing and studies to confirm the commercial viability of Nel’s hydrogen-generating platform.

Norway is set to become a regional leader in the hydrogen market through the new electrolyser

The Viking nation has welcomed the announcement made by Nel that underscores the strategic importance of the hydrogen market and the renewable energy sector overall. The company stated that, following a seven-year development program, the successful start-up and production of clean hydrogen from its Next Generation Pressurized Alkaline prototype, the company’s Board of Directors took the Final Investment Decision.

The FID will enable Nel to begin construction on a 1 GW hydrogen production platform at the Herøya facility, which is located in the Herøya Industrial Park in Porsgrunn, Norway. The development of the new electrolyser began way back in 2018, and following rigorous testing of several smaller electrolyzer stacks, the company has now completed the testing for the full-scale system.

Nel expects to launch the new system in the first half of next year, with full-scale deliveries expected sometime in 2027. The company has stated that its new Next Generation Pressurized Alkaline platform can completely reshape operational costs of hydrogen production, delivering astonishing levels of clean hydrogen for the international market.

“Our new solution is extremely important for Nel as a company, but also for the clean hydrogen industry as a whole. A significantly improved levelized cost of hydrogen is expected to unlock business cases that were previously not viable without significant subsidies,” – Håkon Volldal, President and CEO of Nel

The project has attracted the attention of the European Union

The expected costs of developing the electrolyser are astronomical to say the least, the initial 1 GW of energy is set to cost approximately NOK 300 million. However, the project has such high strategic importance for the European clean energy ambitions that it has been granted significant funding from the European Union Innovation Fund.

The Viking energy company has been awarded EUR 135 million by the EU Innovation Fund to develop the project further to reach an estimated output capacity of 4 GW once fully operational. The funding from the EU fund covers approximately 60% of the relevant CAPEX and operational costs associated. As other European nations progress with their own electrolyser deployments, Norway is set to dominate the market through Nel’s Next Generation Pressurized Alkaline platform.

Following years of stagnation, the international energy market is finally giving the hydrogen sector the attention it deserves. Hydrogen can completely reshape global energy output capacity while keeping a close eye on the associated emissions from the energy market. Without the renewable energy sector, the world will see new environmental disasters becoming all too common.

Decarbonizing the international energy market is a shared responsibility

We can not understate the importance of decarbonizing the international energy market, as it is one of the main contributors of greenhouse gases. With the digital and AI age picking up traction, a new wave of energy demand has hit the market. AI data centers have been popping up all over the world as a litany of tech companies aim to revolutionize the tech market. Those AI centers will need vast amounts of energy. The technology for hydrogen production has been progressing to match the expected increase in energy demand driven by the new AI race.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/24.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 16:00:53.813396

The writedown ‌was seen as the most visible sign to date of the auto industry's pullback from a technology carmakers ‌wholeheartedly embraced early this decade, exacerbated by President Donald Trump's cancellation of electric-vehicle tax breaks.

Ford Motor's shares rose 1.3% before the bell following the announcement. Tesla edged 0.6% lower and General Motors was flat. U.S.-listed shares of Stellantis were up about 1%.

Washington's action ⁠has deepened the decline in ‌sales, forcing the Detroit Three automakers - Ford, GM and Chrysler-parent Stellantis - to roll back their ambitious EV plans in the U.S. and ‍pivot back to their hybrids and gasoline-powered vehicles.

""Ford's strategic reset is a clear acknowledgement of shifting market realities and consumer demand,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The charges are a ""painful reset for the company"" ​but one that is essential to align itself with consumer interests which would ‌eventually improve profitability and returns for Ford, Morgan Stanley said.

U.S. sales of EVs fell about 40% in November following the expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit on September 30. The incentive had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand.

Since September, Ford shares gained 14%, GM rose 34% and Tesla advanced about 7%.

GM took ⁠a $1.6 billion charge in October as it adjusted ​its EV factory plans, and warned that it ​would likely take more charges in the future. Stellantis has also backtracked on some of its EV plans, axing a scheduled electric Ram ‍pickup truck and leaning ⁠into hybrids.

""This move by Ford was to be expected (and should be expected for others) given a new reality on the dramatically weaker U.S. EV environment, driven ⁠by weaker demand and heavily reduced compliance requirements,"" Barclays analysts said.

It is, however, a step in the ‌right direction, and can help Ford improve profits, they added.

Under President Trump, the United States has become a climate denier and a drag on the energy revolution it was poised to lead.
The Trump administration’s actions have moved the United States from the forefront of the emerging energy revolution to the role of spoiler.
Americans didn’t ask for this reckless assault on the nation’s environment, energy security, and public health.
With the Trump administration’s return to office, those billionaires got what they wanted.","Since taking office last January, the Trump administration has waged the worst assault in history on the environment and public health. It has taken or proposed nearly 400 reckless and misguided actions that undermine clean air and water, healthy wildlife, and public lands, all of which sabotage a safe and climate-friendly future.

In just one year, this administration has taken a wrecking ball to the commonsense safeguards and foundational institutions we all depend on to stand sentry against industrial-scale pollution and the harm it brings. It has upended five decades of responsible public oversight that has strengthened the economy, defended public health, and vastly improved our quality of life.

Amid the staggering pace of this administration’s broadside attacks on sound governance, constitutional norms, and the rule of law, much of the environmental assault has been waged without the public attention, scrutiny, or review it deserves.

As it has enfeebled essential institutions like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the administration has placed the U.S. Department of Energy in the hands of a fossil fuel executive and handed over U.S. energy policy to the oil and gas industry.

While the administration rigs the game to further enrich oil and gas billionaires, the rest of us are paying the price—in our homes, communities, factories, and farms.

Since Trump took office, home electricity bills have spiked 9.6 percent, on average. One reason is that power companies are spending money to upgrade aging transmission and distribution lines. Another is the soaring demand for power from the energy-guzzling data centers overtaking much of rural America.

The Trump administration’s policies are directly driving up costs

Backed by its allies in Congress, this administration is ending clean power incentives that were catalyzing innovation and investment, creating thousands of jobs, and saving billions of dollars each year for power providers and consumers alike. This administration is trying to suppress the cheapest form of new electricity generation—wind and solar power.

The administration has blocked or delayed wind and solar projects that could power millions of homes, at a time when that power is desperately needed to counter rising pressures on price and demand.

In the process, the administration is handicapping U.S. workers and companies in the economic play of our lifetime—the global clean energy transition that attracted a record $2.2 trillion in investments in this year alone. The Trump administration’s policies won’t stop the historic global shift to clean energy; they’ll just make it harder for U.S. workers, and easier for our competitors, to benefit from it.

It’s worth recalling where we were when the second Trump administration began

At that time, the United States was helping to lead the world toward a clean energy future that promised to deliver cleaner air and lower utility bills while also sharply mitigating the cascading impacts of rising seas, hotter heat waves, and raging wildfires, storms, and floods.

Across the United States, clean energy jobs were growing at three times the level of the economy overall, with more than 3.5 million Americans working each day to help make our homes, cars, and factories more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.

And, supported by federal incentives, American corporations announced more than $120 billion in investment in new factories to build solar panels, transmission and grid components, advanced batteries, and electric vehicles, all of which had created more than 106,000 jobs across the country between 2022 and 2024.

Under President Trump, the United States has become a climate denier and a drag on the energy revolution it was poised to lead. The Trump administration’s actions have moved the United States from the forefront of the emerging energy revolution to the role of spoiler.

Americans didn’t ask for this reckless assault on the nation’s environment, energy security, and public health. On the contrary, nearly 6 in 10 Americans (57 percent) say the U.S. government is doing too little to protect the environment. Nearly two-thirds (62 percent) say environmental quality is getting worse. And across the nation, people understand that the benefits of responsible environmental safeguards far exceed the cost of compliance—by more than 30 to 1, in the case of the Clean Air Act.

The public doesn’t want these manifest gains turned back, but someone else does: the oil and gas billionaires and other big polluters.

With the Trump administration’s return to office, those billionaires got what they wanted. Now, the rest of us are paying the price.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2025-12-19 10:59:10.766195

Detroit has officially unveiled the first electrified public roadway in the United States capable of charging electric vehicles wirelessly as they drive. The project uses embedded inductive charging coils beneath the pavement to transfer power directly to compatible EVs, eliminating the need to stop and plug in during travel.

The technology is being tested on a stretch of road as part of Michigan’s broader push to position itself as a national leader in next generation transportation infrastructure. Only vehicles equipped with special receiver hardware can currently access the charging system, meaning the rollout remains limited while data is collected on efficiency, safety, and scalability.

If proven successful, electrified roads could dramatically reshape how electric vehicles are charged, reducing range anxiety and potentially shrinking the need for large onboard batteries.

In addition to its Wärtsilä partnership, the company has entered a tolling agreement with an unnamed Fortune 500 company for an undisclosed amount for Mallard. North America-focused WHC Energy Services will also come on board as an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) provider to facilitate Mallard’s construction.

According to its website, Peregrine has executed more than 50 GWs of renewable energy and energy storage facilities across North American energy markets. In October, it secured $130 million in new capital from investors including the Ministry of Environment of South Korea to advance its United States BESS portfolio.

A month later, in November, Peregrine closed a preferred equity agreement with Bildmore Clean Energy for a BESS project that was already under construction. Peregrine has originated and developed a pipeline of 15 GWh of storage across the United States.

The company’s Quantum2 system is a fully-integrated high-capacity system designed for large-scale deployment. It uses Wärtsilä’s GEMS Digital Energy Management Platform to monitor, control and optimize the BESS system and is compliant with ISO standards for 20-foot containers. Safety is a big focus for Wärtsilä, and its Quantum2 system is fully compliant with international safety standards, including NFPA 855. It features fully tested pre-installed liquid-cooled IP67 modules, requiring no additional site work and providing additional safety. Quantum2 successfully passed several control systems tests in September 2025.Meanwhile, ESS News reported that the company’s Quantum3 energy storage system passed three major fire safety and explosion tests in November.

Wärtsilä has deployed and contracted more than 19 GWh of energy storage worldwide. This year’s pv magazine Awards jurors in the Energy Storage category named Wärtsilä’s Blackhillock BESS in Scotland as the overall winner.

Duffy BESS debt financing

Also in Texas, Californian independent power producer and developer Linea Energy has closed project debt financing for its 235 MW/470 MWh standalone BESS – the Duffy BESS – in Matagorda County.

Financing for the Duffy project comprises a construction-to-term loan, tax equity bridge loan, and a letter of credit facility. Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (Nord/Lb) served as coordinating lead arranger and Societe Generale and SMBC acted as joint lead arrangers.

“We are thrilled to announce the closing of debt financing that will facilitate completing construction on the Duffy BESS project,” said Cassidy DeLine, CEO of Linea Energy. “We are grateful for the financial commitment of our lender partners whose support enables us to advance critical battery energy storage infrastructure in the Lone Star State.”

“The Duffy BESS project represents an important milestone in our mission to strengthen the resilience of the grid that powers Texas homes and businesses,” added the executive of Linea, which refers to itself as a “newly-formed independent power producer aiming to change the status quo of how clean energy is developed and financed to rapidly increase the speed of deployment.”

These credits can provide your government with significant financial returns for investments in renewable energy projects.

1. Understanding Elective Pay and Eligibility

Elective pay allows government entities, traditionally ineligible for tax credits, to receive refunds. This shift, introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, opens the door for substantial financial incentives. For example, a Northern California city recently secured over $6 million in credits on a $28 million project.

To take advantage of these opportunities, your government must navigate the elective pay process — including pre-filing registration and understanding critical timelines.

2. Diverse Credit Opportunities

Energy tax credits are not limited to one type of project. They encompass a wide range of investments, including:

Energy Property: Investments in renewable energy equipment.

Energy Production: Generating electricity from renewable sources.

Commercial Clean Vehicles: Purchasing new commercial clean vehicles.

Electric Vehicle Recharging: Installing recharging or refueling equipment.

Each category has specific criteria and potential return rates, which can vary significantly based on factors like project location and adherence to prevailing wage requirements.

3. Critical Timelines and Application Processes

Timely action is crucial for maximizing these credits. For the 2023 tax year, pre-filing registration must be completed by July 15, 2024, to meet the IRS's review period recommendations. Additionally, applications for the Low-Income Community Bonus Credit Program, which can increase credits by up to 20%, are due by June 27, 2024.

Properly tracking and documenting project costs is essential for accurate credit computation and successful filing.

Maximizing Energy Tax Credits for Your Government

Your state or local government stands to gain significantly from energy tax credits by understanding and navigating the elective pay process, exploring diverse credit opportunities, and adhering to critical timelines. Engaging with tax professionals can help you maximize potential refunds and enhance your renewable energy investments.

The renewables have helped bring the growth of greenhouse emissions to a virtual standstill in China and put a global carbon peak within reach, said Science magazine, naming the renewable energy surge led by China the 2025 Breakthrough of the Year.

""China's mighty industrial engine is the driver,"" the journal stated, noting that the country produces 80 percent of the world's solar cells, 70 percent of wind turbines and 70 percent of lithium batteries ""at prices no competitor can match.""

Renewables overtook coal as the world's top energy source for the first time this year, propelled by China's milestone of surpassing 1 terawatt of installed solar capacity in May, said the British scientific journal.

In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a capacity twice as much as the rest of the world combined, according to Nature.

""China and many developing countries are deploying solar and wind [and] electric vehicles at a pretty breakneck pace,"" Glen Peters, a climate scientist, was quoted as saying.

RECORD EXPANSION

China's renewable energy expansion has shattered records, with wind and solar capacity surpassing thermal power for the first time in history by March.

By the end of June, China's installed wind and photovoltaic power generation capacity had reached 1.67 billion kilowatts, representing 13.6 percent higher than thermal power capacity.

Over the past five years, China has built the world's largest and fastest-growing renewable-energy system, with the share of renewables in installed power capacity rising from roughly 40 percent to 60 percent, according to the National Energy Administration (NEA).

During this period, the proportion of non-fossil fuels in China's energy consumption has climbed by one percentage point and coal's share has fallen by the same margin every single year, as shown in NEA data.

The 2025 energy Nature Index reveals that from 2019 to 2024, China's clean energy output was significantly higher than that of other countries.

In addition, China operates the world's largest carbon market by coverage, regulating over 60 percent of national carbon dioxide emissions through effective permits.

NEW COMMITMENTS

In September, China announced its new Nationally Determined Contributions with ambitious targets for 2035, including reducing economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7 to 10 percent from peak levels.

This represents China's first absolute emissions reduction target covering the entire economy and including all greenhouse gases, which is a testament to its firm resolve and maximum effort.

China also aims to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035 and to expand the installed capacity of wind and solar power sixfold from 2020 levels.

GLOBAL IMPACT

China's renewable energy expansion has not only transformed its domestic energy landscape but has also positioned the country as a global leader in the fight against climate change.

""China's burgeoning exports of green tech are transforming the rest of the world, too,"" said the journal Science.

In the last five years, the country's wind and solar exports have helped the world avoid roughly 4.1 billion tonnes of carbon emissions, according to the NEA.

It has collaborated with over 100 countries and regions on green energy projects, helping reduce the average cost per kilowatt-hour of global wind and photovoltaic power generation by 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, said Wang Hongzhi, head of the NEA, at a forum in October.

China has also provided more than 177 billion yuan (about 25 billion U.S. dollars) in climate funding for other developing countries since 2016.

Instead, Metz advises that Georgia Power should its near-term needs on battery storage with shorter lifetimes and therefore, lower risk.","Georgia Power proposes adding a new natural gas unit to Plant McIntosh as part of a major grid expansion.

An expert witness testified the proposed unit would be the most expensive natural gas plant in the United States.

Environmental groups and energy organizations fear the high costs will burden residential ratepayers for decades.

About 15 miles north of Savannah and right above the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge in Rincon, Ga., stands Plant McIntosh, a robust 10-unit gas plant made up of eight 80-MW combustion turbine units, and two 660-MW combined cycle (CC) units. In 2022, it was listed as the state's fourth-largest carbon dioxide emitter.

Under Georgia Power's proposed nearly 10,000 megawatt (MW) grid expansion, it could be getting an eleventh unit, an addition that has received much scrutiny in the past week.

In last week's final round of Georgia's Public Service Commission (PSC) hearings on Georgia Power's energy expansion, Sierra Club attorney Isabella Ariza called its expert witness to the stand.

In an assessment of Georgia Power's Request for Proposal, Synapse Energy Economics Senior Associate Lucy Metz submitted a piece of testimony that Plant McIntosh would be the most expensive natural gas plant built in the United States.

The new 747-MW unit “is the highest cost I have seen for a CC [combined cycle] plant in the United States,"" according to Metz's testimony.

The former coal plant, retired in 2019, is named among three methane plants in Georgia Power's All-Source Resource Capacity request. The newest CC addition, McIntosh Unit 12, would produce 11% of Georgia Power's planned expansion.

As Georgia Power revs up to build new-generation capacity, largely to serve rapidly growing data center demand, they have filled most of their energy generation portfolio with CCs.

But environmental and energy organizations fear the plants will burden the average residential ratepayer. And the interveners representing them in the PSC hearings argue that CC costs will outlive the lifespan of data center contracts, pointing to Plant McIntosh for its high costs and the long-term financial risks it could pose.

""That is the one that sticks out like a sore thumb,"" said Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) Attorney Jennifer Whitfield. ""It is the most expensive option on the table, and we just don't need it.""

Combined cycle, combined costs

CC facilities use two different kinds of thermodynamic cycles to generate electricity and therefore tend to have higher upfront costs than typical single-turbine gas plants. The most common CC plant is a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), using gas and steam turbines.

The argument for CCGTs is that their higher fuel efficiency will balance out over time and high enough loads, ultimately providing cheaper electricity and lower emissions.

But CCGT plant operations costs have been on the rise. According to a report by the American Public Power Association, CCGT projects cost about $2,000 per kilowatt, nearly double of what was originally projected for the next two years.

“The capital costs of combined cycle units have more than doubled since Georgia Power completed its 2025 IRP,” said Metz. “Building the proposed combined cycle units now will lock Georgia ratepayers into the current high costs for these resources for decades to come.""

In the early 2000s, national CCGT capacity boomed to nearly 50 GW. But due to oversupply, market saturation and rising natural gas prices, new CCGT capacity steadily decreased. About half of today's CCGT capacity was built between 2000 and 2006, according to the U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA).

""Hardly any new natural gas capacity came online last year,"" reported the EIA—just one industrial CCGT power generator blipped online in the U.S. in 2024.

But as Georgia Power plans to contribute five more at plants Bowen, Wansley and McIntosh, it's not alone. Developers plan to add 18.7 GW of CC capacity in the U.S. by 2028, with 4.3 GW already under construction.

""However, developers of all those planned units are working through regulatory approvals and securing needed equipment, both of which add uncertainty to their construction costs and initial operation date,"" the EIA stated.

Rather than eliminating the option due to potential risk, the PSC states Plant McIntosh on the bottom of the utility's to-do list.

“We recognize its economics are not as good as the other ones, so that’s why you would put it towards the bottom” of the list, said PSC Utility Finance Director Tom Newsome. It would ""be one of the last ones you pull.""

Hinting what's ahead

As an intervener, SELC was privy to the projected cost breakdown of Georgia Power's energy portfolio, but ""we can't share the actual cost publicly, unfortunately,"" said Whitfield.

And the fear is how these costs will outlast the contracts between Georgia Power its large-load customers.

""Because data center load is happening so rapidly and it's such a high magnitude that Georgia Power is having to procure much more expensive resources to serve that load,"" said Metz. ""There's a very real risk that the data center load will instead drive up rates for existing rate payers unless we have these safeguards put in place.""

The design lifetime of CCGT units is typically 25 to 30 years, according to the EIA. Georgia Power set an asset life of 45 years for each of the CCGT plants.

""So in 2070 we could still be paying for Plant Macintosh, and won't need it,"" said said Whitfield.

According to Georgia Power’s rebuttal testimony, Metz’s analysis did not account for inflation.

“The appropriate adjustment for inflation demonstrates that the Company’s thermal resources are, in fact, comparable to other reported costs,” said the rebuttal testimony filed on Nov. 26.

But at the hearing, Metz did not budge.

""f you assume that inflation over the next 5 years will be somewhere between 2 and 2.5%, Macintosh still falls at the very upper range or above the benchmark cost that I provide in my testimony,"" said Metz.

These benchmark costs provided a point of comparison among other regional utilities in the country, and did not prove that Georgia Power did ""a bad job curating CC's. It's to point out how elevated CC costs are across the board for all utilities,"" said Metz.

Instead, Metz advises that Georgia Power should its near-term needs on battery storage with shorter lifetimes and therefore, lower risk.

""A combined cycle unit that comes online in 2030 will lock in capital and fuel costs through 2075, two to three times longer than the maximum length of a data center contract,"" said Metz. ""In contrast, the 20-year lifetime of battery storage resources aligns more closely with typical data center contract length.""

These projects will see Orkney connected to the transmission grid for the first time, as well as significantly strengthening the transmission infrastructure serving communities including Skye, Fort Augustus, Argyll and Kintyre.

EGL2 HVDC subsea project is the largest ever single investment in the UK transmission system and will play a critical role in delivering the UK and Scottish governments’ clean power and energy security targets – supporting thousands of jobs across the country and boosting local and national economies.

The National Wealth Fund’s supported financing offers longer-dated lending, better aligning with the life of grid assets and ensuring the swift progression of these four critical upgrade projects, which have been independently assessed as required by both the independent National Energy System Operator (NESO) and the energy regulator, Ofgem.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

“We are investing in grid upgrades and homegrown, clean energy to get us off the global energy price rollercoaster, creating thousands of new, skilled jobs in the process, and boosting growth. This builds on our action at the Budget to take an average £150 off energy bills.

“This backing from the National Wealth Fund will help deliver the infrastructure upgrades needed to capitalise on Scotland’s renewable energy production and help strengthen the energy security of the whole UK.”

Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband said:

""We are supporting 3400 good jobs for Scotland, reversing years of underinvestment in our energy grid to connect more clean homegrown power to get bills down.

“Our clean power mission is about growth, jobs and energy security – and this £800 million guarantee from the National Wealth Fund for Scotland’s electricity grid delivers on all three.”

Scottish Secretary, Douglas Alexander said:

""This £800 million guarantee is a major vote of confidence in Scotland's leading role in delivering Britain's energy transition.

It shows the strength of the U.K.’s support for Scotland as this National Wealth fund guarantee will support up to 3,400 jobs, strengthen our energy security, help reduce bills, and ensure the renewable power generated in Scottish communities can reach homes and businesses across the country.""

Globally, EV sales grew last month at their slowest pace (six per cent) since February 2024.

Terence Corcoran: The new Rogers v. Rogers play gets a BS rating Terence Corcoran: A minimum wage is a tax on labour.","In a global world seemingly dominated by big government economic interventions and industrial policies fabricated out of the fantasies of politicians and bureaucrats — known as state capitalism — there are developments that suggest markets still prevail.

Two such occasions, one Canadian and the other international, stand out as welcome signs that market realities dominate. In Ottawa, Industry Minister Mélanie Joly’s major — even embarrassing — backtrack on the $70-billion merger of Teck Resources and Anglo American shows that when the cards are on the table, governments must bow to private markets.

Another victory for market reality over government central-planning fantasies is the political backtracking on electric vehicles and, more broadly, on climate policies in general.

Ottawa ramps up Anglo-Teck approval

A few weeks ago, Joly’s staff made a point of correcting a media report that the government’s Investment Act decision on the Anglo-Teck merger would be coming “next month.” Not true, said the minister’s staff. What Joly had said is that the decision would come “in the next months,” thereby pushing the deadline deep into 2026.

So why was the decision suddenly released this week, essentially within days rather than months? And, more importantly, what happened to all the minister’s blither about how the announced merger deal was not “enough” and that the new company should, among other things, move its primary stock listing to Toronto rather than London?

Based on information released Tuesday by the companies, nothing significant has changed since Joly launched her not-enough statements. The new company has committed to a 15-year series of targets and spending plans, but nothing on the list would amount to a meaningful change in corporate intentions and strategy. For example, it commits to spending $4.5 billion in Canada over the next five years. Was Teck not planning such spending before this week?

The sudden appearance of Ottawa’s decision follows the Supreme Court of British Columbia’s final approval of the merger on Dec. 12 and a massive majority vote by Teck shareholders approving the merger on Dec. 9.

Ottawa’s sudden approval of the merger confirms the primacy of a market-driven investment environment over a planning-driven environment. Anglo-Teck was a test of Canada as a market economy, and it passed the test over the heads of Joly and the Carney Liberals.

EV and climate policies face market forces

Around the world, the speeding electric vehicle market is slowing down as market reality begins to overtake automobile sales. The biggest hit is taking place in the United States, where EV sales fell 42 per cent in November following the removal of government tax credits. Left to the mercy of market prices, sales inevitably declined.

Globally, EV sales grew last month at their slowest pace (six per cent) since February 2024. At the same time, the European Commission this week unveiled a plan to relax the EU’s ban on new internal combustion-engine (ICE) cars beginning in 2035. The proposal was described by activists as the region’s “biggest retreat from its green policies in recent years.” EU automakers, however, argue the reduced target does not go far enough in light of market realities.

The EV market in Canada has also been tilted by the inability of governments to overcome the challenge of completely replacing ICE vehicles with electric automobiles — much to the distress of activists. New statistics released this week show new Canadian EV registrations dropped from 18 per cent to nine per cent of sales in the third quarter while ICE sales rose.

Clean Energy Canada, a Simon Fraser University think-tank, blamed the decline in Canada’s EV market on Ottawa for having “made a number of decisions that have collectively broken Canada’s EV market over this past year.” The opposite is true. In reality, it is the market that has broken another part of the federal government’s industrial plan to remake the automobile industry. Electric vehicles may well be the way of the future, but the future cannot be driven by massive government interventions. It takes a market. As Ford CEO Jim Farley said this week: “We can’t allocate money for things that will not make money.”

EV market troubles are only one part of a shifting global reality. Industrial strategies and state planning cannot overcome and crush the market economy. Even corporations cannot break the market reality they are dealing with. A Financial Times feature last week documented how two British oil giants — Shell and BP — failed to transform their companies into pioneers of the green energy transition away from fossil fuels.

In 2021, the two companies set out to become transition leaders by investing billions in electric and other non-emitting energy sources. The plan failed as BP and Shell confronted internal operational turmoil, unco-operative markets and unhappy shareholders. Both companies had to write off billions of dollars in misguided investments.

The BP-Shell fiasco highlights a bigger trend. Wall Street Journal columnist Greg Ip last weekend raised the question: “Whatever happened to the climate crisis?” Activists such as Bill Gates have pulled back, for example. But Ip writes that the real cause of change in the climate debate is “affordability, and affordability won.”

By definition, that means the reality of the market won. May it always be so.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country’s shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country’s copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India’s capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India’s battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India’s waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India’s government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery’s contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it’s an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

This week, New York’s State Energy Plan was approved. It provides a balanced and pragmatic framework that treats energy as essential economic infrastructure. By embracing resource diversity, prioritizing affordability and reliability, and aligning energy policy with advanced manufacturing, the Plan positions New York State to compete, grow, and lead in a rapidly evolving national and global energy landscape.

The approval of New York State’s updated State Energy Plan also marks a pivotal moment for the state’s economic and industrial future. Developed through more than a year of analysis and extensive public engagement, the Plan provides a pragmatic framework for navigating rising energy demand, affordability pressures, grid reliability challenges, and continued progress toward a cleaner energy economy. More importantly, it recognizes that energy policy isn’t an abstract environmental exercise, but rather a foundational driver of economic development, industrial competitiveness, and community stability across New York.

At a time when energy systems face uncertainty from economic volatility and shifting federal priorities, the Plan adopts a realistic and balanced posture. New York continues to advance renewable energy at scale, but the Plan acknowledges that renewables alone can’t shoulder the full burden of reliability, affordability, and growth. The plan explicitly recognizes advanced nuclear technologies and natural gas as part of a diverse energy mix needed to meet system needs through at least 2040. This emphasis on resource diversity reflects an understanding that resilient energy systems underpin investor confidence, business expansion, and long-term job creation.

For New York’s economic development strategy, this framing is especially significant. Advanced manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication, life sciences, data centers, clean technology production, and electrified transportation all depend on access to abundant, reliable, and competitively priced power. The Plan recognizes the emergence of large new energy loads and the need to manage their grid and cost impacts thoughtfully. Rather than viewing these loads as a threat, the Plan positions them as an opportunity, provided energy planning, infrastructure investment, and demand management are aligned.

Energy affordability is treated as both a household concern and an economic competitiveness issue. Rising energy costs erode disposable income, strain small businesses, and weaken New York’s ability to compete with other regions for industrial investment. The Plan’s increased focus on system cost management, demand-side flexibility, and peak load reduction is therefore central to its economic logic. By lowering upfront costs for efficiency and clean energy adoption and by managing when and how electricity is used, the state can reduce the need for expensive infrastructure while protecting ratepayers and employers alike.

Equity is integrated into this affordability framework in a practical way. The Plan emphasizes reducing the financial burden on lower-income households while ensuring that the benefits of the clean energy transition, including jobs, workforce training, and local investment, are broadly shared. This approach strengthens public trust and reinforces the social license necessary for long-term infrastructure development.

The Plan also clearly links energy policy to workforce development and innovation. New York’s ability to lead in advanced manufacturing and clean energy depends on skilled labor, strong supply chains, and coordinated investment across its innovative ecosystem. By strengthening partnerships among state agencies, research institutions, utilities, labor organizations, and the private sector, the Plan supports job creation while also enhancing the return on public investment. These partnerships are especially critical for emerging technologies such as advanced nuclear, grid-scale storage, hydrogen, and next-generation manufacturing processes.

Reliability remains a central pillar throughout the Plan, reflecting lessons learned from extreme weather events, aging infrastructure, and increasingly complex grid operations. For manufacturers and large employers, reliability is non-negotiable; outages and volatility translate directly into lost productivity and higher costs. By prioritizing a diverse mix of generation resources and resilient supply infrastructure, the Plan reinforces New York’s value proposition as a dependable place to invest and operate.

Equally important is the Plan’s recognition that decarbonization and economic growth are not mutually exclusive. By aligning clean energy deployment with industrial demand, workforce readiness, and grid reliability, New York can position itself as a national leader in the next era of industrial growth. This alignment is particularly relevant as companies increasingly factor energy reliability, emissions performance, and long-term cost stability into site selection decisions.

The development of the Plan itself underscores the importance of transparency and stakeholder engagement. With nearly 15,000 written comments and broad participation across sectors, the process reflects the complexity and importance of energy decisions for communities, workers, and businesses statewide. The commitment to biennial implementation reports further reinforces accountability and adaptability as conditions evolve.

Ultimately, the State Energy Plan signals a shift from aspirational energy goals to disciplined execution. It acknowledges the realities of today’s energy system while laying out a credible path forward that supports economic development, advanced manufacturing, and community well-being. By grounding clean energy ambition in affordability, reliability, and resource diversity, the Plan strengthens New York’s ability to attract investment, create jobs, and sustain growth over the next two decades.",https://www.macny.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-Presidents-Message.png,N,,2025-12-19 09:00:30.420043

For us at Grist, greenlash stood out as the word of the year, marking a moment when climate change was yanked off the political priority list.
Carbon pawprint A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.","The years leading up to 2025 were marked by a rare optimism that the United States would finally do something about climate change. Former president Joe Biden called the crisis an “enormous opportunity,” and during his term, Congress passed the biggest climate law in the country’s history. It felt like the U.S. was on the cusp of a greener future — until that momentum came to a sudden halt.

As soon as President Donald Trump took office in January, he brought a swift end to that era with an all-out assault on his predecessor’s policies, unraveling environmental protections and canceling climate research. Trump abandoned global climate commitments while aggressively promoting fossil fuels at home, even as the rest of the world installed more solar panels and wind turbines than ever before.

There’s a word for this kind of reactionary response: greenlash, a social and political backlash against efforts to rein in emissions. In Trump’s second term, climate change became a politically radioactive word: Phrases including “clean energy,” “climate science,” and “pollution” began disappearing from government websites.

And people around the country took the cue. Corporations got quiet about their climate plans. Democratic politicians steered clear of phrases like “planetary emergency.” Media coverage of the climate crisis thinned. That all trickled down to everyday Americans, who say they’re hearing less than they used to about climate change on social media and from the people they know.

While greenlash might sound like a very American phenomenon, it actually took off in Europe. The EU was an early adopter of comprehensive climate policies, and also saw the first big wave of greenlash. That opposition was mainly driven by specific economic burdens — Germany’s plan to switch to energy-efficient heat pumps caused an uproar as homeowners worried about the costs, for example. In the United States, the greenlash gathered more fuel from Trump-style populism and the culture wars.

With a tumultuous 2025 coming to an end, dictionary editors have been digging through the lexicon for words that capture its spirit. Their picks — “AI slop,” “rage bait,” and the essentially meaningless phrase “6-7” — point to a world that’s very online, and not doing much better for it. For us at Grist, greenlash stood out as the word of the year, marking a moment when climate change was yanked off the political priority list.

The mood might have shifted, but people in the U.S. are about as concerned about climate change as they’ve ever been, with about two-thirds saying they’re worried. The consequences of a warming planet were on full display this year, from the horrific fires that burned through Los Angeles neighborhoods in January to the rains that drenched Texas in July, causing the deadliest flash flooding in the country in half a century. It was also a turbulent time for the politics of climate change, a trend reflected in these words and phrases that captured the zeitgeist.

Carbon pawprint

A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.

A host of articles this year highlighted how cats and dogs have an outsized carbon pawprint — and, wow, pet owners got worked up about it. The chief culprit is the meat-heavy diets they feed their pets, with beef in particular emitting a lot of methane, a powerful, planet-warming gas. The conversation really kicked into gear this summer with a headline from The Associated Press: “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.” The dog ownership question was only a tiny part of that study, which investigated how people rank the climate impact of various personal actions, like going vegan or using public transit. But the headline’s focus blew up on Reddit, where people complained that focusing on individual responsibility instead of big, systemic changes missed the point. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one user wrote sarcastically.

Cheap energy

A Democratic messaging slogan linking clean energy with lower costs for consumers.

Hoping to reach Americans more concerned about rising electricity bills than the upward march of global temperatures, Democrats have been talking more and more about how clean energy is cheap energy. After getting trounced in the 2024 election, many Democratic politicians turned to polling to see what had gone wrong. One theory was that they spent too much time talking about social issues like climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, putting them out of step with voters who cared more about affordability and health care. As one new think tank, the Searchlight Institute, summed it up: “Don’t say climate change.” Climate champions in Congress aren’t avoiding the topic entirely, but selling climate-friendly policies as a strategy to lower the cost of living instead. In September, for instance, two Democratic representatives, Sean Casten and Mike Levin, introduced the “Cheap Energy Agenda.” There’s some evidence the pivot might be working, after Democrats notched wins in November’s off-year election in races where energy costs played an important role.

Critical minerals

Raw materials that are crucial for modern technology, but in limited supply.

It was hard to avoid the phrase critical minerals in 2025, when it moved from policy jargon to the headlines. These metals — including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and so-called “rare earths” — are essential for building solar panels and the batteries that power electric vehicles and e-bikes. The Trump administration has been aggressively chasing these metals as part of its national security strategy, hoping to secure the vital ingredients for making everything from smartphones to high-tech military technologies. Trump signed executive orders calling for more mining of critical minerals and fast-tracked permits for new projects, while also setting his sights on procuring more supply abroad by negotiating deals in Ukraine, central Africa, and across Asia. Stocks for some rare-earth mining companies have more than tripled this year as critical minerals got hyped up. Some experts think that the future of geopolitics will be more defined by these critical metals than by oil.

Energy dominance

A slogan-turned-policy-goal emphasizing fossil fuel production and American power.

When Trump signed an executive order on Inauguration Day aimed at “unleashing energy dominance,” the phrase left experts scratching their heads. It soon became clear it had everything to do with maximizing the production of oil, gas, and coal in order to gain leverage over other countries. It certainly had nothing to do with dominating the market for renewable energy. Experts told Grist that the phrase seems to be more about vibes than specific policy goals. It taps into a nostalgia for what fossil fuels once promised — optimism, growth, and a certain ideal of masculine work. This kind of chest-beating reaction to industrial decline and climate change even has a name: “petro-masculinity.”

Green New Scam

A Trumpism that counters climate policy by rebranding the “Green New Deal” as a conspiracy.

The Green New Scam has become the Trump administration’s defining line on efforts to take on climate change. Trump came up with the catchphrase during a rally in New Hampshire in 2023, while riffing on ways to attack Biden’s climate policies. When he landed on “Green New Scam,” the crowd roared with approval, and he sensed he was onto something — even though Congress had never actually passed a Green New Deal. Renee Hobbs, who wrote a book on modern propaganda, told Grist that Trump’s repetition of Green New Scam fits into a classic strategy: “You repeat the phrases that you want to stick, and you downplay, ignore, minimize, or censor the concepts that don’t meet your agenda.”

Rain anxiety

A growing sense of dread triggered by rainfall.

For many people, the sound of raindrops isn’t comforting at all, but terrifying. If you’ve survived a flood, it can bring up traumatic memories, leading to what’s called rain anxiety. “Anyone else getting mildly stressed when it rains a lot?” reads a typical Reddit post on the matter. Floods struck many parts of the U.S. this year — not only Texas, but also New Mexico, Illinois, North Carolina, New York, and Washington state. By mid-year, the National Weather Service had issued almost 4,000 flash-floods alerts, the most for that time period since 1986. About 20 to 30 percent of people who live through flooding develop depression or post-traumatic stress disorder in the months afterward, according to a report from the U.N.’s international panel of climate scientists. There’s a clear connection to climate change: A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, making the idiom “when it rains, it pours” more of a reality than ever before.

The order, in effect at least until March 16, 2026 to prevent claimed risk of winter power outages, follows two similar Trump orders this year directed at plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Wright cited the nation’s “unprecedented surge in electricity demand,” saying the Energy Dept “will continue taking action to keep America’s coal plants running.”

Let’s be clear: There’s no emergency here.” It is unclear when or if the state will join Michigan and Pennsylvania in filing a federal lawsuit against the closure.

Keeping the facility open beyond 2025 offers a reliable supply of power essential for grid stability in the Northwest, according to Wright. The department ordered the Bonneville Power Administration to handle power transmission from the Centralia plant. Rate recovery is available through federal regulations governing energy emergencies, according to Wright.

Plans were already in place to reopen the site as a 700-MW gas-fired power generator by 2028, with Puget Sound Energy agreeing on Dec. 9 to purchase power from the updated facility.

Gas Conversion is 'Priority'

Calgary, Alberta-based TransAlta confirmed in a statement to ENR that it it is evaluating the federal directive and “will work with state and federal governments.” But it said “the coal-to-gas conversion project remains a priority for TransAlta,”

The company said it will provide more details regarding the directive “in due course.”

The Energy Dept. cited a ""resource adequacy report"" saying blackouts in the U.S. were on track to potentially increase 100 times by 2030 if power continued to be taken off-line. The agency also noted a North American Electric Reliability Corp. 2025-2026 “winter reliability assessment” that the Northwest region is at elevated risk during periods of extreme weather, such as prolonged cold snaps.

The report also said delays threatening completion of new battery storage, solar and wind power-generating projects. But Trump administration policies also are hindering expansion and connection of those power projects to transmission systems.

The state officials said that instead of helping stabilize the Washington power market, the federal action “is more likely to drive up costs and expose Washington communities to more pollution.”

TransAlta’s plan to spend $600 million to convert the facility from coal to natural gas-fired generation and operate it until the end of 2044 is part of the agreement with Puget Sound Energy. TransAlta anticipated a final investment decision made after receipt of all required approvals in early 2027, including the agreement.

John Kousinioris, TransAlta CEO and president, previously said that converting to natural gas would “lower the emission intensity profile of the facility by approximately 50%.” He also said facility operation as a gas power plant ""will generate long-term contracted cash flow for TransAlta, earning a full return on capital within the contract term.”

On its website. TransAlta says Centralia is a merchant plant, with costs such as environmental upgrades not passed on to customers. The company says it has invested more than $300 million in coal pollution control technology at the plant, including scrubbers and low nitrogen dioxide burners.

TransAlta did not confirm status of contractor selection for the gas conversion, but Kousinioris previously said the company ""is well-positioned to execute this project given our deep technical, operational and engineering experience gained in previous coal-to-gas conversions.”

Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act requires state utilities to end all coal-fired generation by 2026 as part of a push toward greenhouse gas neutrality in 2030 and emission-free grid by 2045.

'Federal Overrreach'

“This federal overreach is incredibly unproductive,” Lauren McCloy, utility and regulatory director of NW Energy Coalition, a 100-member utility, business and civic clean energy advocacy group, told ENR. “Keeping a plant open that is slated for closure is not useful or economically feasible. This order takes resources and focus away from addressing the real challenges we have.”

McCloy said the Energy Dept. is “misinterpreting regional resource adequacy assessments” that do not indicate an imminent emergency, but show the system is adequate to meet demand in the near-term, even factoring in the long-planned Centralia coal plant retirement.

But forecasts assume a high level of uncertainty about how much load from data centers will materialize in the region. “The solution is to continue to plan for, acquire and build the new resources and transmission that we need to meet that load as it materializes,” McCloy said.

Christina Wong, Washington Conservation Action interim CEO, added that burning coal is an expensive way to produce energy, and Patti Goldman, Earthjustice attorney, called the federal order a “fake emergency.”

USA, Texas, Houston: Giga Energy has announced the opening of its new medium-voltage manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The 5,600 m2 (60,000-sq-ft) plant will serve as the company’s main US site for producing medium-voltage transformers, with production scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026. Annual output is expected to exceed 3,000 units, providing critical electrical infrastructure amid ongoing transformer supply constraints.

At launch, the Houston Factory will create 25 jobs, with plans to expand to nearly 100 as production increases. The facility supports domestic manufacturing and provides faster access to transformers for data centres, renewable energy projects, and industrial power systems.

The plant features advanced manufacturing equipment, including a terahertz drying oven that accelerates moisture removal during transformer production, enhancing consistency and reducing cycle time. Local manufacturing also allows Giga Energy to maintain direct oversight of quality and delivery schedules.

Matt Lohstroh, CEO of Giga Energy, said: “The MV Houston Factory combines advanced manufacturing technology with American-based production to deliver higher quality, faster lead times and new local jobs, all at a moment when the country urgently needs more transformer capacity.”

The MV Houston Factory will also supply transformers for Giga’s development projects, including over 500 MW of electrical infrastructure for AI-focused data centres. This will support both Giga-operated sites and colocation facilities for enterprise and hyperscale AI operators.

The facility is set to play a key role in scaling U.S. transformer production and reinforcing energy infrastructure for data centres, renewable generation, and industrial networks.

It’s been a difficult year for clean energy in America. President Donald Trump entered office in January and promptly stopped the transition away from fossil fuels and toward solar, wind, and batteries in its tracks. Right?

Not quite. In fact, for all of Trump’s paeans to ​“beautiful, clean coal” and to natural gas, it’s clean energy that has once again led the way this year. Through November, 92% of new power capacity added to the grid in 2025 came in the form of solar, wind, or storage, according to Cleanview analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data shared with Canary Media.

That’s in line with figures from recent years. In 2024, 96% of U.S. capacity additions were carbon-free.

This year, solar alone accounted for half of new capacity added to the grid through November, while storage made up 31%. Despite Trump’s all-out assault on wind energy — and his pledge that no ​“windmills” would be built during his term — the energy source has so far accounted for more gigawatts of new electricity than gas turbines have.

It’s worth noting that December is typically the busiest month for new energy deployments in the U.S., so these numbers will look a bit different when the full-year data comes in. It’s also possible that clean-energy deployments are artificially high right now as developers race to complete projects before Trump’s restrictions on lucrative tax credits kick in. And, overall, fossil fuels still generate a much larger share of U.S. electricity than renewables do — even if solar and wind are closing that gap.

Still, the figures underscore the warnings made by energy experts, policymakers, and advocates: The Trump administration is playing with fire by trying to limit the development of solar, battery, and wind energy right when electricity demand is rising at its fastest rate in decades.

These are the quickest sources of energy to deploy. Meanwhile, gas turbines face a supply-chain crunch that is both driving up the cost of some new power plants and making it near impossible to build enough gas facilities to meet new demand, even if climate concerns weren’t a factor.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/cotw-clean-capacity-nov.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=9405f635392e8f848318cf0262be2cc2,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:43.864284

Although youth climate plaintiffs have notched some victories, they have also seen setbacks.","Rikki Held grew up on her family’s ranch in Montana, watching the land transform amid the climate crisis. The Powder River, which runs through the property, has sometimes dried up during drought, leaving crops and livestock without water. At other points, rapid snowmelt and heavy rains have caused flooding and eroded riverbanks, making the land difficult to use.

Two years ago, the 24-year-old and a group of other young people won a groundbreaking legal victory, intended to prevent those impacts from worsening. In August 2023, a judge ruled in favour of plaintiffs in Held v Montana, in which 16 young people accused the state of violating their constitutional rights by promoting planet-warming fossil fuels. The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings late last year, but plaintiffs say lawmakers have since passed new laws that violate that ruling. So last week, they filed a new petition calling on the supreme court to enforce their earlier win, one of several youth-led constitutional climate lawsuits filed in the US this year.

“We have to keep working on cases like these,” Held said. More on this eventful year in youth climate litigation, after this week’s headlines.

In focus

Represented by the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, US youth brought other accountability-focused climate suits in 2025. In May, 22 young Americans sued the Trump administration, alleging that federal officials were violating their constitutional rights with their pro-fossil fuel policies, including moves to declare a “national energy emergency” and “unleash American energy”, and an order aimed at “reinvigorating” the domestic production of coal – the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuel. A judge dismissed the lawsuit this autumn, but the group quickly appealed.

Eva Lighthiser, the 19-year-old named plaintiff in the federal court case, is also involved in the Montana litigation. Its earlier success “reminded me just how important democracy and the power of young voices are,” she said.

“With that in mind, [suing] this current administration was something I approached with confidence in our judicial system and the US constitution,” said Lighthiser.

Young climate plaintiffs also filed cases this year against Wisconsin and Utah. In September, some also submitted a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, claiming the US was violating international law by perpetuating a fossil fuel-based energy system.

The lawsuits face a challenging path. Although youth climate plaintiffs have notched some victories, they have also seen setbacks. Earlier this year, Juliana v United States – perhaps the best-known US youth climate lawsuit, which argued the US was harming youth by perpetuating a fossil-based energy system – ended after wending its way through the court for 10 years, when the supreme court declined to hear an appeal.

But the plaintiffs remain undeterred.

“Young people are inheriting an uncertain future where climate change is only going to continue to worsen, and it feels essential for us to use our voices and take action in [any] way we can,” said Lighthiser.

“When Held was initially filed in 2020, I was too young to vote. As young people, taking to the courts can be our only viable option in regard to participating in democracy.”

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.",https://www.qcnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/12/694470622b39d5.30442811.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:26.563093

“So, in terms of building new plants, there’s an incentive to build more … and there’s incentive to build too much.”","An investigative report released this morning by Wisconsin Watch finds that shuttered power plants are on track to cost Wisconsin ratepayers nearly $1 billion by the end of 2026. At the same time, the state is facing unprecedented pressure to generate new electricity for data centers—raising the risk of another $1 billion in future “stranded assets.”

This reporting comes as the Legislature considers community solar legislation (SB 559 and AB 493), which would lower energy bills, strengthen the grid, and return decision-making power to local communities. The bill establishes a community solar program that allows farmers and developers to build small-scale projects—typically 20 to 30 acres—that neighbors can subscribe to and save 10% on their monthly utility bill. This approach expands access to solar, the cheapest form of electricity, avoids large-scale developments, and does so with zero taxpayer dollars.

Key Points from Wisconsin Watch:

In fact, residential and business utility customers throughout Wisconsin owe nearly $1 billion on “stranded assets” — power plants like Pleasant Prairie that have been or will soon be shut down, a Wisconsin Watch investigation found.

That total will likely grow over the next five years with additional coal plants scheduled to cease operations.

Customers must pay not only for the debt taken on to build and upgrade the plants themselves, but also an essentially guaranteed rate of return for their utility company owners, long after the plants stop generating revenue themselves.

Utilities “profit off of everything they build or acquire,” Stuart said, “and so there is a strong motivation to put steel in the ground and perhaps to even overbuild.”

When the Public Service Commission approves construction of a new power plant, it allows the utility company to levy electricity rates high enough to recover its investment plus the specified rate of return — even after a plant becomes a stranded asset.

Efficient Power Distribution: Designing electrical grids to be more efficient and reliable using modern power electronics and direct current (DC) systems.

""For a totally new grid. A smart DC grid makes way more sense with modern power electronics.""

""Then a DC smart grid makes more sense for connecting the solar panels home battery and the EV directly to each other.""

Decentralized Generation with HVDC

Local Power Generation: Placing power generation closer to load centers and using High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) for interconnections to reduce transmission losses.

""Generation needs to be near load centres, the way it used to be before there were national power grids, then use HVDC for interconnections.""

Mesh Networks for Reliability

Redundant Grid Design: Implementing mesh networks to build redundancy into the electrical grid, improving reliability and reducing the risk of blackouts.

""Look to mesh networks. Redundancy built in.""

Reduced Car Dependency

Improved Public Transit: Focusing on reducing the number of cars in cities through enhanced public transportation and alternative modes of transport.

""Owning electric cars is no solution for most problems that cars cause in cities... The solution is fewer cars.""

""Mixed traffic streetcars are a complete failure from what I can tell. Worse than busses since they so easily get blocked by cars."" - Highlights the need for dedicated infrastructure for public transit.

Affordable Solar Technology

Low-Cost Solar Panels: Leveraging the production of inexpensive solar panels to make green energy accessible, especially for developing countries and urban areas with poor grid infrastructure.

""China is producing small solar panels at unimaginably low prices, and these solar panels are being distributed in large quantities to developing countries with poor national power grids.""

Vertical Farming

Urban Food Production: While currently uneconomical, vertical farming is seen as a potential future solution for urban food production, which could reduce the energy associated with food transportation.

""Just for the record, vertical farming is a cool idea with a lot of upsides that may become practical in the future if we managed to make some big improvements in our energy system.""

They reached out to their Reddit community to help determine which one was best.

The homeowner explained in the r/HVACAdvice subreddit that they were deciding between two heat pump brands and wanted to take advantage of the expiring tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act.

When choosing heat pumps and installers, TCD's HVAC Explorer page is a great place to start your research. You can save up to 50% on your energy bills and also choose from subscription services, with no money down.

The Inflation Reduction Act is also a great tool for saving you money. You can earn tax credits for upgrading your home with a heat pump, but you have to act fast before it expires. This is exactly what the homeowner is utilizing.

The OP said, ""We're deciding whether to replace our 35-year-old furnace + 2.5 ton AC with a heat pump to take advantage of the $2000 expiring federal tax credit.""

Heat pumps work differently from a traditional HVAC system. In the warmer months, they pull the warm air from inside your home and transfer it outside. In the colder months, they pull the heat from the ground, water, or air, and transfer it to the inside of your home.

Heat pumps work more efficiently than other heating solutions, which is how they can save you money. Because they work more efficiently, they are also better for the environment. They use less energy than a traditional HVAC system, and they don't have to run on fossil fuels, like a gas furnace, for instance.

When you're ready for the upgrade, the HVAC Explorer page can connect you with trusted partners. Palmetto is one of the partners that offers a subscription service for $0 down and as little as $99 a month. The company also provides 12 years of free maintenance, which can lower the total cost over the lifetime of the unit since you won't be paying for maintenance or repairs.

Check out the Palmetto home app to get up to $5,000 in rewards you can use on home upgrades. To maximize your savings, you can also install solar panels, and TCD's Solar Explorer page can connect you with trusted installers in your area.

After all of the advice that the OP received, they said, ""Seems like a no-brainer at this point.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/heat-pumpimage-recGgHBtlYQOloRW6-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 05:58:30.151951

And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were key employers.
There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods.
This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.
Government efforts to prevent the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boost the demand for coal may slow coal’s decline in the short term.","As projections of U.S. electricity demand rise sharply, President Donald Trump is looking to coal – historically a dominant force in the U.S. energy economy – as a key part of the solution.

In an April 2025 executive order, for instance, Trump used emergency powers to direct the Department of Energy to order the owners of coal-fired power plants that were slated to be shut down to keep the plants running.

He also directed federal agencies to “identify coal resources on Federal lands” and ease the process for leasing and mining coal on those lands. In addition, he issued orders to exclude coal-related projects from environmental reviews, promote coal exports and potentially subsidize the production of coal as a national security resource.

But there remain limits to the president’s power to slow the declining use of coal in the U.S. And while efforts continue to overcome these limits and prop up coal, mining coal remains an ongoing danger to workers: In 2025, there have been five coal-mining deaths in West Virginia and at least two others elsewhere in the U.S.

A long legacy

Until 2015, coal-fired power plants generated more electricity than any other type of fuel in the U.S. But with the rapid expansion of a new type of hydraulic fracturing, natural gas became a cheap and stable source for power generation. The prices of solar and wind power also dropped steadily. These alternatives ultimately overcame coal in the U.S. power supply.

Before this change, coal mining defined the economy and culture of many U.S. towns – and some states and regions, such as Wyoming and Appalachia – for decades. And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were key employers.

Coal has both benefits and drawbacks. It provides a reliable fuel source for electricity that can be piled up on-site at power plants without needing a tank or underground facility for storage.

But it’s dirty: Thousands of coal miners developed a disease called black lung. The federal government pays for medical care for some sick miners and makes monthly payments to family members of miners who die prematurely. Burning coal also emits multiple air pollutants, prematurely killing half a million people in the United States from 1999 through 2020.

Coal is dangerous for workers, too. Some coal-mining companies have had abysmal safety records, leading to miner deaths, such as the recent drowning of a miner in a sudden flood in a West Virginia mine. Safety reforms have been implemented since the Big Branch Mine explosion in 2010, and coal miner deaths in the U.S. have since declined. But coal mining remains a hazardous job.

A champion of coal

In both of his terms, Trump has championed the revival of coal. In 2017, for example, Trump’s Department of Energy asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to pay coal and nuclear plants higher rates than the competitive market would pay, saying they were key to keeping the U.S. electricity grid running. The commission declined.

In his second term, Trump is more broadly using powers granted to the president in emergencies, and he is seeking to subsidize coal across the board – in mining, power plants and exports.

At least some of the urgency is coming from the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence, which the Trump administration champions. Many individual data centers use as much power as a small or medium city. There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods. Using those plants would require data centers to reduce their electricity use during those peaks – which it’s not clear they would agree to do.

So many data centers, desperate for 24/7 electricity, are relying on old coal-fired power plants – buying electricity from plants that otherwise would be shutting down.

Limits remain

Despite the Trump adminstration’s efforts to rapidly expand data centers and coal to power them, coal is more expensive than most other fuels for power generation, with costs still rising.

Half of U.S. coal mines have closed within the past two decades, and productivity at the remaining mines is declining due to a variety of factors, such as rising mining costs, environmental regulation and competition from cheaper sources. Coal exports have also seen declines in the midst of the tariff wars.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s recent effort to follow Trump’s orders and lease more coal on federal lands received only one bid – at a historically low price of less than a penny per ton. But in fact, even if the government gave its coal away for free, it would still make more economic sense for utilities to build power plants that use other fuels. This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.

Natural gas is cheaper – and, in some places, so are renewable energy and battery storage. Government efforts to prevent the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boost the demand for coal may slow coal’s decline in the short term. In the long term, however, coal faces a very uncertain future as a part of the U.S. electricity mix.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9894-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:50.449280

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country’s shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country’s copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India’s capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India’s battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India’s waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India’s government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery’s contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it’s an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

The Sessions The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat.
Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule.
The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others.
Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.","As part of their proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to revise the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) (collectively, Agencies) hosted three public comment sessions in which they received verbal comments from those in attendance. Two of the sessions were held in person with virtual attendance options – Bismarck, North Dakota on December 12, 2025, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 15 – while the third session, on December 16, was fully virtual. EPA’s website contains additional details on the sessions, including draft agendas that list individuals who pre-registered to speak.

Background

As Nossaman previously detailed here, the Agencies are seeking to revise the definition of WOTUS and, thereby, what features would or would not be regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Because of the significant regulatory burden associated with being subject to CWA jurisdiction and permitting, the definition of WOTUS has been frequently litigated. The U.S. Supreme Court has weighed in on four separate occasions, and the Agencies have revised the definition four times in roughly a decade.

The Proposed Rule generally focuses on limiting federal jurisdiction through narrowing what qualifies as a WOTUS. More information on the rulemaking can be found here.

The Sessions

The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat. Representatives from the Agencies opened each session by explaining the need for the Proposed Rule. The Agencies stated there were three objectives served by the Proposed Rule: fully implementing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 598 U.S. 651 (2023); cutting red tape to reduce costs; and protecting water quality by striking the right balance between state and federal authority. They also highlighted that they were seeking clarity, certainty and durability while requesting information on regional differences and tools to implement any final rule.

Each session lasted between 3 and 3.5 hours. Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule. As a result, the Agencies did not answer any questions from those in attendance. The sessions were recorded for internal use, although the Agencies plan to post transcripts to their respective websites.

The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others. The first half of this session (i.e., pre-break) was hosted by U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) rather than by the Agencies. Senator Cramer, Senator John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong all voiced support for the Proposed Rule and opposition to the existing framework. The commenters during this part of the session included local government officials and business leaders, all of whom voiced their support for the Proposed Rule. It was also unique because no list of commenters was provided. The second half of this session set the stage for the following sessions, as it was led by the Agencies, included a list of pre-registered speakers (both online and in-person) that was provided to the observers and provided an opportunity for other commenters after that.

The Pittsburgh session included the least participation of the three. Like the North Dakota session, it included a mix of online and in-person commenters, providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The fully remote session was the most well attended, again providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The Comments

Across the three sessions, there were roughly 75-100 commenters. The comments were split nearly 50-50, with a slight edge over all of the sessions in commenters opposed to the Proposed Rule. However, the North Dakota and Pittsburgh sessions included more supportive comments whereas the remote-only session included more opposition comments. Many commenters requested the comment deadline be extended given the importance of the rule and the various holidays that fall within the comment period.

The following list summarizes the most common points made by commenters and is not intended to be exhaustive:

Comments in support

Common sense rule that can be instituted without the need for experts or lawyers and reduces uncertainty

Consistent with Sackett and other WOTUS precedent

Cuts red tape and lowers costs

Returns jurisdiction back to states, tribes and landowners, all of whom know their land better than bureaucrats

This rule is durable and should stop the back-and-forth of the past decade over WOTUS

Supporters often advocated for a strengthening of the Proposed Rule, listing the need for more clarity on significant terms such as continuous surface connection, relatively permanent and wet season. They also advocated for more clarity/a strengthening of essentially every exception that is listed, with ditches receiving the most attention. Supporters also advocated for tools and other guidance to assist with implementation.

Comments in opposition

Ignores the science on these issues, in particular the impact of wetlands, ditches and other now-excluded areas that impact traditional navigable waters

Features like intermittent streams and ephemeral streams have a substantial impact on navigable waters

Shifts costs away from those responsible onto the public

Especially the case with the loss of protection for wetlands, which provide flood control and other services that protect citizens

Contrary to the intent of the Clean Water Act, which has overwhelming support in public polling

Polls show that people want more protection, not less

Bad for public health

Does not protect tribal rights

A giveaway to polluters/developers/is political in nature

Next Steps

Written comments can be submitted until January 5, 2026, on www.regulations.gov; commenters must mention Docket ID EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

Given the number of commenters on both sides of the Proposed Rule requesting changes to it, it seems likely that the final rule could differ in some meaningful ways from the proposal. One area that the Agencies discussed was ensuring that the Proposed Rule properly reflected local conditions; they expressed a desire to ensure that the definitions and guidelines in the rule were clear enough to easily implement while also being crafted in a way to take into account regional differences in watershed conditions. For example, the commenters from North Dakota were supportive of the fact that prairie potholes did not qualify as WOTUS (although some wanted that more explicitly stated in any final rule) while one from Alaska discussed that this rule did not align with physical watershed conditions in Alaska. Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.",https://www.nossaman.com/i-t1766106585/logo-og.png,N,,2025-12-19 02:59:36.257332

Clean water, big savings Revoking the Roadless Rule and putting clean water sources at risk doesn’t just impact public health—it threatens local economies too.","From the edge of the Staunton Reservoir, you can peer into the crystal clear waters that trickle down from Virginia’s George Washington National Forest. The Reservoir, which was created by the construction of the Staunton Dam in 1926, is the main water supply for the nearby city of Staunton. It’s also fed by rivers and streams in roadless areas, which are places protected by the Forest Service’s Roadless Rule.

The Roadless Rule is a critical policy that protects some of our wildest public lands from unnecessary roadbuilding and industrial development, ensuring they can be enjoyed by future generations. Roadless areas are world-class destinations for hikers and mountain bikers, boast old-growth forests, support local economies, and, importantly, provide clean drinking water for communities downstream.

Tell Congress to save the South’s wildest forests.

“The water coming off of the National Forest here in the valley is just so clean that it’s better than bottled water that you could buy,” Lynn Cameron, co-chair of the group Friends of Shenandoah Mountain, said. “We’re just so lucky to have clean water that tastes good, too.”

But she worries that luck could run out, because the Forest Service is currently pushing to get rid of the Roadless Rule, a move that would open roadless areas to harmful development and would put these incredible places—and the region’s supply of clean water—at risk.

The water coming off of the National Forest here in the valley is just so clean that it’s better than bottled water that you could buy.

Lynn Cameron, co-chair of the group Friends of Shenandoah Mountain

Communities “fortunate” to have clean water

Virginia has more acres of roadless areas than any other state in the eastern United States—nearly 400,000 acres. Roadless areas in the Shenandoah Valley make up one of the largest tracts of undeveloped public land in the region. They also safeguard dozens of creeks, rivers, and streams that are important drinking water sources for people living downstream.

“The roadless areas are the cleanest source of water that we have in the state, and the communities like Harrisonburg and Stanton and the Shenandoah Valley that get their water supply directly from reservoirs that flow out of roadless areas, they are very fortunate to have such clean water,” Lynn Cameron said.

Cameron’s sentiment is echoed by the city of Staunton itself. In a recent water quality report, the city mentions the Forest Service’s strict management of the area, saying the guardrails on development there protect the drinking water sources from pollution.

“The local governments have been very concerned about what happens to these mountains because they know how important the water supply is and they don’t want anything to happen,” Cameron said.

But it’s not just nearby communities that benefit from the crystal clear rivers and streams in Virginia’s roadless areas. The waters flow into the Potomac and James Rivers, benefiting millions of people downstream.

An SELC analysis found that more than three million people in Virginia and in Washington D.C. get their water from watersheds that are fed by streams in roadless areas.

That means if you turn on a faucet in Virginia, there’s a good chance the water coming out of your tap started in a roadless area.

“Just about everybody in Virginia benefits from the protection of this area because they’re using the water,” Cameron explained. “We’re lucky to be up here in the headwaters, but downstream they’re getting the benefit of these clean waters, too.”

Attack on our clean water

But those benefits are threatened by the Forest Service’s proposal to revoke the Roadless Rule, which would allow the agency and deep-pocketed corporations to carve up roadless areas with roads and logging projects that put clean water at risk.

Roads significantly increase pollution that runs into waterways. Harmful hydrocarbons like gasoline and oil can easily flow off of roads and into rivers and streams. Roads also erode slopes, clogging waterways with dirt, debris, and other contaminants.

When they fall into disrepair—which is often—roads pollute nearby streams, clogging them with dirt and sediment that hurts water quality and chokes out fish and other aquatic life. The Forest Service estimates that there are already “at least” 20,000 problematic roads—likely an underestimation due to a lack of agency assessments—and repairing them would cost more than $1.2 billion.

“Unnecessary roadbuilding is a massive threat to clean water,” SELC Senior Attorney Kristin Gendzier said. “Over the last 25 years, the Roadless Rule has protected important water sources from contamination by preventing reckless development. Getting rid of this critical safeguard will threaten the water that communities across the South rely on every day.”

The Forest Service isn’t looking to build new roads in roadless areas to make it easier for people to get to trailheads or scenic views. In fact, less than 25 percent of the agency’s current road system is open to passenger cars. Instead, the roads would be built for logging trucks as companies look to cut down forests that were previously protected by the Roadless Rule. The Forest Service has said as much, writing in its notice of intent to repeal the roadless rule that the goal is to “take immediate action” to increase logging on public lands.

Clean water, big savings

Revoking the Roadless Rule and putting clean water sources at risk doesn’t just impact public health—it threatens local economies too. The unpolluted qualities of water coming from Virginia’s roadless areas means that cities in the Shenandoah Valley have to spend fewer tax dollars to filter and treat water before it is pumped to homes and businesses.

Brad Striebig, an engineering professor at James Madison University, says the city of Harrisonburg, Virginia, saves millions of dollars by getting clean water from roadless areas in the George Washington National Forest. And those financial benefits—like the water itself—flow downstream to other communities across the state.

“We’re talking millions of dollars just to the city of Harrisonburg. You can imagine you could extrapolate the value of that water as it moves from the mountains to the coast. It’s immeasurable, it truly is. You cannot put a value on that water.”

Adding roads into roadless areas threatens those financial benefits, and when water gets contaminated, it’s taxpayers left on the hook.

Once we put things into the water, it’s much more expensive to treat them than to rely on the pure water that’s already there.

Brad Striebig, James Madison University

From the mountains to the bay

The effect of roadless areas in western Virginia can even be felt hundreds of miles away on the shores of the iconic Chesapeake Bay. Clean headwaters help reduce pollution that ends up in the bay, protecting a vital natural resource. The bay supports a thriving tourism economy and is the backbone of the region’s fishing industry, producing more than 500 million pounds of seafood each year.

But roadbuilding, logging, and mining projects in roadless areas will lead to pollution that not only hurts mountain streams but flows downriver into the Chesapeake Bay where it can do long-lasting damage. Sediment pollution, which is the biggest risk factor from unnecessary roads, smother oysters and other key species that live there.

“Decades of collaboration and billions of dollars have gone into cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay—which is a national treasure and a source of intense regional pride. In all these efforts to clean up the bay, we sometimes forget the critical role of keeping its headwaters clean,” Gendzier said. “Getting rid of the Roadless Rule would allow more pollution into bay headwaters, setting back our long and hard fight to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. That should make us all angry.”

Protecting roadless areas

At the base of Staunton Dam, there’s a sign marking the importance of clean water for nearby communities, reading “one of the most important products of the National Forests is water for human needs.” Cameron says the Forest Service’s push to revoke the Roadless Rule puts that purpose at risk.

“I think it’s a huge mistake,” Cameron said. “There’s too much at stake here to open this up to roads and logging.”",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Staunton-Water-Supply-Header.png,N,,2025-12-19 06:59:07.421198

While the U.S. energy system is continually evolving, the 10th District is well poised to retain a leading role in energy in the coming decade.","10th District Energy Overview

The 10th District remained a leading energy producing region over the last decade. Since 2015, the 10th District ranked second among Federal Reserve District’s for fossil fuel production (Chart 1, left panel). While fossil fuel production in the 10th District fell, mostly due to declining coal production in Wyoming (Chart 5, right panel), oil and natural gas production continued growing within the district (Chart 3, right panel).

For renewable energy, the 10th District ranked third among Fed districts. Power generation from renewable sources grew from roughly 14 percent to roughly 37 percent over the last decade (Chart 1, right panel). The shift toward renewable energy was driven primarily by the expansion of wind facilities (purple area) in states like Oklahoma and Kansas – some of the windiest locations in the country (Cowley and Farha 2024, EIA 2024). All-in the 10th District is an energy-abundant region of the U.S., which maintained its importance over the last decade.

Energy Trade Flows

Energy trade flows were a key change in the U.S. energy system in the last decade – the topic for the External LinkFederal Reserve’s 10th Annual Energy Conference. Growing energy exports were supported by rising production levels (Chart 3 – Panel A) and the U.S. moved from being a net importer to net exporter of energy products over the last decade. The U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 (Chart 2, left panel), driven by growing natural gas production and a rapid increase in liquified natural gas (LNG) exports (Chart 2, right panel). The U.S. is now the world’s largest LNG exporter (EIA 2025a). Similarly, the U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum in 2018 (Chart 2, left panel), following the repeal of the crude oil export ban in 2015. The growth in U.S. petroleum exports over the last decade were driven primarily by growing crude oil exports (Chart 2, right panel). The U.S. is now one of the top five crude oil exporting nations globally.

Oil and Natural Gas Production

Greater energy exports coincided with rapidly growing domestic energy production over the last decade. U.S. crude oil and natural gas production rose by roughly 50 percent over the last decade (Chart 3, left panel). However, oil and natural gas production growth was mixed across 10th District states in the last decade – New Mexico (Permian Basin) was a notable outlier with oil production growth over 4 times and natural gas production growth roughly 2 times. Colorado had a more modest oil and natural gas production growth – 39 and 9 percent, respectively. Oklahoma witnessed a 12 percent decline in oil production growth and 13 percent increase in natural gas. Wyoming had a 24 percent increase in oil production and 48 percent decline in natural gas production (Chart 3, right panel). Higher oil and gas production growth over the last decade was predominantly concentrated in locations with the greatest productivity gains.

Drilling Productivity

A driving force behind growing oil and gas production levels in the U.S. is a substantial rise in productivity. Chart 4 shows a measure of capital and labor productivity – output per unit input – for oil and gas production by location. Drill rig productivity – the primary form of capital equipment used for extracting oil and gas – more than doubled over the last decade and labor productivity rose by roughly 90 percent. Drilling productivity changes were mixed across District states: Colorado and New Mexico both saw substantial productivity gains – rig productivity rose 385 percent and 108 percent in CO and NM respectively, while labor productivity rose 64 percent and 336 percent respectively. Oklahoma rig and labor productivity rose by 147 percent and 93 percent. Wyoming witnessed a modest 9 percent decline in rig productivity and 3 percent increase in labor productivity in the last decade.

Coal Electricity Generation and Mining Activity

While oil and gas production rose in the last decade, coal declined. Coal electricity generation fell by nearly 50 percent in the U.S. and roughly 40 percent in the 10th District over the last decade. As overall electricity generation capacity grew – driven mostly wind and natural gas – coal as a share of total electricity generation fell by 17 percentage points in the U.S. and 27 percentage points in 10J (Chart 5, left panel). Coal as a share of net electricity generation now makes up only 16 percent of electricity generation for the U.S. and 34 percent for the 10th District. As demand from the power sector subsided, coal mining activity also fell in the last decade. U.S. and 10th District (mostly Wyoming) coal mine production fell by nearly 50 percent in the last ten years (Chart 5, right panel).

Renewable Energy

While coal declined in prominence, renewable energy adoption steadily grew over the last decade. Renewable energy generation in the 10th District grew by a little over three-fold and roughly doubled in the U.S., driven by steady growth in wind and more recently greater solar adoption. Consequently, the renewable share of electricity generation grew from roughly 14 percent in the 10th District and U.S. to roughly 37 and 26 percent, respectively (Chart 6, left panel). With rapid expansion in renewable generation over the last decade, most District states now exceed the national average share for renewables, with wind and solar as the primary contributors to the renewable generation mix (Chart 6, right panel).

Conclusion

Over the last decade the 10th District remained a leading energy region in the U.S., even as domestic energy system witnessed several key changes. Oil and natural gas production grew nationally and regionally, driven by rising productivity. Growing domestic oil and gas production helped support energy exports, turning the U.S. into a net exporter of natural gas and petroleum over during that time period. While coal production declined regionally and nationally, renewables rose substantially. The 10th District outpaced the U.S. in renewable energy additions, driven by rapid growth in wind and solar generation. While the U.S. energy system is continually evolving, the 10th District is well poised to retain a leading role in energy in the coming decade.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/images/HERO_SIZING_FOR_IMAGES_78.original.png,N,,2025-12-19 05:59:28.723693

World leaders were a bit premature in announcing the death of internal combustion. Ford recently became the latest global manufacturer to acknowledge it made a colossal, $20 billion mistake in throwing all its energy behind electric vehicles.

“The $50, $60, $70,000 EVs just weren’t selling. We’re following customers to where the market is. … These really expensive $70,000 electric trucks, as much as I love the product, they didn’t make sense,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC.

The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker wasn’t alone in going all in on converting its entire lineup into plug-ins. Just about every major brand embraced the delusion that, one day, people would intend to be able to travel a few hundred miles, pull over and wait an hour or more at a roadside station for their high-tech jalopy to draw sufficient juice from the grid.

Toyota was the notable exception in refusing to hop onto the politically correct bandwagon like its peers. The Japanese firm produces just one battery-motivated vehicle. The remaining offerings include an assortment of hybrids, normal sedans and SUVs. It even offers a pair of gas-guzzling sports cars, a rare option in these times.

C-suite automotive executives elsewhere felt their world turn upside down when President Trump flipped the off switch on the subsidies. Predictably, EV sales plunged 53% the instant the freebies vanished. The administration is also eliminating the onerous fleet mileage targets that were meant to strangle vehicles animated by fossil fuels.

On the bright side, the big car companies will no longer toss billions of dollars into the bonfire by developing overpriced models that nobody wants. Misallocated capital resources pushed sticker prices skyward, even on gas-powered cars, because someone has to pay for that research and development.

Thus, an average automobile now costs $50,000, a staggering $16,000 rise over the past 10 years. With the scam unraveling, these numbers should settle.

“It was ridiculous, very expensive. It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate. Biden’s burdensome regulations have caused the price of cars to soar more than 25%, and in one case, they went up 18% in one year,” Mr. Trump said earlier this month as he signed the executive order killing the previous administration’s CAFE standards.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy added on X, “Freedom Means Affordable Cars,” and even the Europeans are seeing the wisdom of Mr. Trump’s actions. The European Commission released a package of reforms Tuesday that some have styled as a reversal of the EV mandate.

It’s more of a slight scaling back. Instead of dictating that 100% of cars must be electric, the bureaucrats in Brussels will allow 10% to be gas-powered. How generous of them. “The Automotive Omnibus will ease administrative burden and cut costs for European manufacturers, boosting their global competitiveness, and freeing up resources for decarbonisation,” a commission statement explained.

That’s good news for Detroit, because a 10% reprieve isn’t enough to stay competitive. Let the Continent continue to dwell in the schemes of the past while America readjusts to restore the liberty the public once had to buy the product that best suits its needs and tastes.

With the current F-150 lightning range can be up to 320 miles when empty, but hanging a trailer off the back of the truck reduces that to about 100 miles.
Today’s F-150 Lightning has up to 580 horsepower and 775 foot-pounds of torque.
“Our next-generation F-150 Lightning EREV will be every bit as revolutionary.
Even further back, GM offered its Volt under the Chevrolet brand, which also was an EV with a gasoline range extending engine.","Ford Motor Company has announced the next generation of its F-150 Lightning Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) half-ton truck and it’s no longer a pure electric vehicle. The new version of the truck still retains electric final drive and battery power, but adds a gasoline engine as a range extender, with the company claiming the total range of battery-only plus gasoline-fueled power of over 700 miles.

This newer model will continue to use an all-electric final driveline and battery power but there will be the addition of a gasoline on-board generator. This is not dissimilar to how a railroad locomotive works and offers the benefit of the flat torque curve that EVs are known for with the additional range and fueling convenience of a gasoline engine.

No details were shared on the gasoline engine itself and contacts at Ford were not willing to divulge more details beyond what were listed in the press release.

With the current F-150 lightning range can be up to 320 miles when empty, but hanging a trailer off the back of the truck reduces that to about 100 miles. A further challenge for towing with any EV is that charging stations on the road are simply not set up to enable a vehicle with a trailer to pull in and charge up. So you would have to disconnect the trailer about every 100 miles to do any appreciable distance.

Where an EV shines with towing is not only in the instant torque of an electric drive motor, but also regenerative braking when slowing. Today’s F-150 Lightning has up to 580 horsepower and 775 foot-pounds of torque. While many bandy about the 10,000-pound pulling capacity, Ford touts the current truck’s cargo carrying of at least a ton — another area where it would also shine when hooking up to a travel trailer.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an EV pickup can still be a great F-Series,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer, stated in the release. “Our next-generation F-150 Lightning EREV will be every bit as revolutionary. It delivers everything Lightning customers love — near instantaneous torque and pure electric driving. But with a high-power generator enabling an estimated range of 700-plus miles, it tows like a locomotive. Heavy-duty towing and cross-country travel will be as effortless as the daily commute.”

In a video presentation with Bloomberg (see above) Ford said it anticipates that about half of the new vehicle shipments will ultimately be EVs. In 2022, Ford sold about 15,6187 Lightning models of its F-150 line with the peak reaching 33,510 sales in 2024. As of November, Ford has sold 25,583 units this year. However, the trajectory of sales of pure electric vehicles has dropped with the elimination of tax credits for EVs.

In the same announcement for the new F-150 Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) the company also stated that it would begin using some of its battery building capacity to start developing power backup solutions for homes and businesses, citing the growing need for power solutions from data centers and AI facilities.

Ford is investing approximately $5 billion and creating or securing nearly 4,000 jobs across its Louisville Assembly Plant and BlueOval Battery Park Michigan to deliver a new pickup and produce advanced prismatic LFP batteries.

One of the new products planned under this change is a mid-sized pickup with a targeted starting price of about $30,000 to be assembled at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant and scheduled for sales to begin in 2027.

The statement indicated that Ford would leverage wholly-owned plants in Kentucky and Michigan to provide solutions for energy infrastructure and growing data center demand.

It was also stated that Ford is working on a universal EV platform that will underpin trucks, vans and other vehicles.

The idea to have an EV with a range extender is not new ,with Stellantis’ Ram brand having announced a similar product a while ago. Even further back, GM offered its Volt under the Chevrolet brand, which also was an EV with a gasoline range extending engine.

When used as a range extender, a gasoline engine’s performance can be optimized for this use case and doesn’t have to be as large an engine as would be the case if it were the sole source of power. For example, in the Ram REV, Stellantis is using the 3.6 liter Pentastar V6 as part of the on-board power generation. Again, this is not much different than a railroad locomotive with the exception of the locomotive not generally having any battery system to power the traction motors.

As a side benefit of having a large on-board generator these vehicles can also be used to provide back-up power to homes or at construction sites giving them another benefit.",https://rvbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ford-Lightning-with-Range-Extender-2-scaled-e1766066623812.webp,N,,2025-12-19 12:00:53.437945

Capacity prices in PJM hit fresh record high

PJM’s supply shortfall affects 13-state region, raising power bills

Governors push for extended price limits

Dec 17 (Reuters) – Power bills for about a fifth of Americans are expected to continue to rise after the largest U.S. grid operator, PJM Interconnection, reported fresh record-high capacity prices on Wednesday that reflected electricity demand by data centers overtaking supplies.

The expansion of Big Tech’s data centers has driven up so-called capacity prices in PJM by about 1,000% over a roughly two-year period, intensifying energy affordability problems for those living and working in the 13-state region covered by the grid operator.

Prices reached $333.44 a megawatt-day in the latest PJM capacity auction.

“This auction leaves no doubt that data centers’ demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply, and the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself,” said Stu Bresler, who becomes PJM’s chief operating officer next month.

Rising costs in PJM have hit everyday power bills in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest U.S. states in the grid’s territory, with some areas seeing a more than 20% jump in utility bills starting from last summer.

Capacity prices make up a portion of utility bills, while other spending on power lines and services and the cost of fuel, such as natural gas, also contribute to the overall cost.

PJM, which operates the grid covering the largest amount of energy-intensive data centers in the world, holds auctions to determine the prices that energy companies will be paid to guarantee they run their power plants when called upon.

On-call generators in PJM’s capacity market are meant to guard against disruptions like blackouts during times when power demand spikes, and the high prices are aimed at encouraging developers to build more supply.

More supply, however, is not coming on fast enough. The available supply secured in the latest auction reached 134,479 megawatts. That was about 6,600 megawatts, or enough to power nearly 5 million homes, short of PJM’s reliability requirement, PJM officials said.

Higher consumer costs led a group of PJM-area governors, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, to negotiate a price ceiling and floor. That price ceiling took effect during the last auction, in July, and extended through the latest bidding round.

Shapiro and others are now calling for the price limit to be extended to future auctions.

“Reforms must be in place in time to protect Pennsylvania ratepayers before the next (auction),” Shapiro said in a filing this week with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

MORE AUCTIONS

PJM once held its auctions three years out from the time the prices took effect to give power companies time to plan for new developments and to budget ahead of time. With regulatory delays affecting the power grid operator in recent years, capacity auctions have begun to take place less than a year out, which power companies say have slowed the pace of new developments.

PJM is now holding catch-up auctions as a way to get back to its three-year-out program. The prices released on Wednesday will take effect for the year beginning in June 2027.

In the meantime, existing power plant owners in PJM are expected to see windfalls from the recent capacity prices. Independent power producer Talen Energy said on Wednesday it expected to land more than $1 billion in capacity revenues for the 2027-2028 planning year.

Shares of Talen were up 3.7% after the market closed, while other PJM-region power producers Constellation Energy and Vistra were also higher by 2.7% and 1.6%, respectively.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country's shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India's growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country's copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India's capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India's battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India's waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world's most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India's government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery's contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it's an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

As Congress expanded the premium tax credits starting in 2021, the ACA marketplace enrollment more than doubled by 2025.
This may increase their reliance on VA for their care if they’re eligible, but many veterans who are ineligible for VA care and benefits will lose access to health care entirely.
How many will lose access to affordable health care or health care altogether due to expiration of ACA enhanced premium tax credits?
How many veterans impacted by changes to SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA enhanced premium tax credits are currently, have recently, or are at risk of experiencing homelessness?","[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Ranking Member Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) today led a group of 26 of their colleagues in a letter calling on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate the impact Republicans’ health care-cutting agenda will have on veterans and their families.

This follows Senate Republicans’ failure last week to join Democrats in extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits, which 267,000 veterans rely on to afford health care. Coupled with Medicare and Medicaid cuts – which go into effect next year – Americans, including millions of veterans and veteran family members, are bracing for higher costs and a looming health care crisis.

“The 2025 budget reconciliation bill, Public Law 119-21, or the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ (BBB), will reduce access to essential health care and supportive services for millions of Americans, including veterans and their families. Compounded with expiring enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans established by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, veterans are facing a life-threatening reduction in access to health care and other essential benefits. These reductions in access to private health insurance, Medicaid, and funding for community health services will result in more veterans relying more heavily on their Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits,” the Senators wrote.

1.6 million veterans and four million family members of veterans utilize Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage because of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” One in ten veterans under the age of 65 relies on Medicaid, and forty percent of these veterans rely on Medicaid as their sole coverage. In addition, recent analysis found 267,000 veterans who rely on ACA enhanced premium tax credits will no longer be able to afford ACA marketplace coverage if these credits are not extended. Veterans who benefit from ACA tax credits are largely not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, or who are not eligible to get some or all of their health care through VA.

The Senators emphasized their concerns with these widespread health care cuts amid the Trump Administration’s ongoing efforts to shrink VA: “Because of the recent catastrophic, unnecessary cuts to VA’s workforce and resources since January 20, 2025, we are deeply concerned about the Department’s capability to support this potential spike in utilization. We write to request you review how these widespread cuts to health care access for all Americans will also impact veterans and their families and to what extent VA will be able to support an influx of veterans relying on the Department for health care more than ever before.”

Recent reporting exposed the Trump Administration’s plan to eliminate as many as 35,000 health care jobs at VA this month, including unfilled positions for doctors, nurses, and support staff. In addition, VA already lost more than 30,000 employees between January and September of this year as a result of President Trump and VA Secretary Collins’ hiring freeze, deferred resignations, early retirements, and the significant number of VA staff who have quit due to Trump and Collins’ draconian workforce policies.

Blumenthal and Schumer’s letter was joined by U.S. Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Coons (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The full text of the lawmakers’ letter is available here and below.

Dear Mr. Dodaro:

The 2025 budget reconciliation bill, Public Law 119-21, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (BBB), will reduce access to essential health care and supportive services for millions of Americans, including veterans and their families. Compounded with expiring enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans established by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, veterans are facing a life-threatening reduction in access to health care and other essential benefits. These reductions in access to private health insurance, Medicaid, and funding for community health services will result in more veterans relying more heavily on their Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits. Because of the recent catastrophic, unnecessary cuts to VA’s workforce and resources since January 20, 2025, we are deeply concerned about the Department’s capability to support this potential spike in utilization. We write to request you review how these widespread cuts to health care access for all Americans will also impact veterans, and their families and to what extent VA will be able to support an influx of veterans relying on the Department for health care more than ever before.

Up to 5.6 million veterans and their family members rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing coverage as a result of funding cuts and further restrictions on eligibility enacted in the BBB. Nearly one in ten veterans under 65 rely on Medicaid, with forty percent of those veterans relying on Medicaid as their sole coverage – often due to ineligibility for Medicare or VA health care. Medicaid helps ensure regular access to care for veterans and their families, especially those who have diverse heath care needs or require care with high out-of-pocket costs, both of which can pose a barrier to care. Regardless of VA’s capacity to absorb these veterans that may now need to rely on the Department for more of their care, many of them are ineligible or were using Medicaid as a supplement because the Department couldn’t provide access to the care they required.

The 140,000 women veterans currently utilizing Medicaid will be particularly impacted by the cuts to this program. This includes nearly one in nine women veterans nationwide and more than one in five women veterans with disabilities, nearly one in seven rural women veterans, and 12.4 percent (54,000) of women veterans who are mothers. Nearly four in ten women veterans rely solely on Medicaid for their health care coverage. For those who are ineligible for Medicare or VA health care, the cuts made in the BBB will likely leave them uninsured resulting in high vulnerability to medical debt or being barred from accessing care altogether.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was also severely harmed by the BBB. Currently, 1.2 million veteran households rely on SNAP benefits. The sixty-three percent of veterans on SNAP who are under 65 will be newly subject to so-called work requirements to maintain access to SNAP. Exemptions from these punishing requirements for disabling conditions are not clearly defined in the BBB, leaving uncertainty regarding whether veterans with disabilities limiting their ability to sustain regular employment will have the requirement waived. For example, a veteran with a traumatic brain injury or severe post-traumatic stress disorder – both conditions more common in veterans than non-veterans and which often require more complex accommodations – may not be exempt despite being unable to maintain the focus or manage the stressors required by many employers. Because of these changes, many veteran households will experience reduced access to SNAP and, therefore, because there is no equivalent alternative service available through VA or any other federal program, their main source of food.

Like the harmful and ineffectual work reporting requirements added to SNAP, the BBB also added these so-called work requirements for certain adults, including veterans, to access Medicaid. The BBB mandates Medicaid enrollees aged 19-64 who are covered through the ACA’s Medicaid expansion must engage in employment, education, a work program, or community service to maintain their Medicaid eligibility. This requirement cannot be waived. Though there are exemptions allowed for certain individuals, including disabled veterans – defined as veterans with a disability rated as total under section 1155 of Title 38, United States Code – and caregivers of children thirteen years of age and under or disabled individuals, the gray areas of life and disabilities often do not align with these black and white requirements. Applying for or updating veteran disability ratings or caregiver status is already a significant challenge and can take years to establish, which, under these new bureaucratic requirements, could leave veterans or their loved ones without health care.

Even veterans who will not lose their coverage due to these Medicaid cuts may no longer be able to access health care because of their reliance on ACA premium tax credits. Since the ACA coverage provisions took effect, the number of uninsured, non-elderly veterans has decreased by more than one-third, from 9.6 percent to 5.9 percent. As Congress expanded the premium tax credits starting in 2021, the ACA marketplace enrollment more than doubled by 2025. However, these enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of this year, and without them many veterans will be forced to withdraw from their health care coverage because they can no longer afford it. This may increase their reliance on VA for their care if they’re eligible, but many veterans who are ineligible for VA care and benefits will lose access to health care entirely. Furthermore, VA’s actuarial firm has indicated that for every one percent of increased reliance on the Department for care, VA can expect its costs to increase by $2.6 billion – a cost unaccounted for in the BBB or VA’s budget request for fiscal year 2026, when these changes will start to take effect.

It is critical for Congress, VA, and, most importantly, veteran households to understand how these recent changes will impact their access to essential health care and nutrition services. With a better understanding of these impacts, Congress and the veteran community can better advocate for swift and effective changes to mitigate the truly catastrophic future created by the BBB. To that end, we request you conduct a review of the potential and actual impacts of this bill and the expiration of the enhanced ACA tax credits on veterans and their families.

To expedite access to this data and improve Congress’ ability to act proactively, we request an initial review and estimation of potential harmful impacts based on current utilization, followed by a subsequent review of the actual impacts to veterans as they unfold from 2026-2028. To the extent practicable, please disaggregate your findings by age, gender, household size, employment status, average income, and any other categories you deem appropriate. In particular, we request you address the following questions as they pertain to veterans and their families, to the extent data are available:

How many utilize SNAP or Medicaid and are impacted by the BBB?

How many will lose access to affordable health care or health care altogether due to expiration of ACA enhanced premium tax credits?

How many are subject to work reporting requirements set for Medicaid? How many are eligible for exceptions to those requirements?

How many are subject to work reporting requirements set for SNAP? How many are eligible for exceptions to those requirements?

How many veterans impacted by changes to SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA enhanced premium tax credits are currently, have recently, or are at risk of experiencing homelessness?

We look forward to working with you to conduct oversight on this important issue. If you have any questions about this request, please have your staff contact the office of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Minority Staff.

At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.
But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far.
Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.
If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India(AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country's shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country's copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India's capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India's battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India's waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India's government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery's contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it's an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

That’s why I support permitting reform and why reforming NEPA is necessary if America is going to remain competitive.
“I was encouraged when Chairman Westerman introduced the SPEED Act.
Our goal is simple: a permitting process that is efficient, predictable, and fair for investors, communities, and the environment alike.” “We urgently need to get permitting reform done this Congress.
These concerns were not addressed before SPEED was brough to the House Floor.","Washington, D.C. – Today, Representative Scott Peters (CA-50) released the following statement after voting against the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development or SPEED Act to update the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

“The environmental laws of the 1970s were designed to stop projects. The environmental imperative of today is to build. That’s why I support permitting reform and why reforming NEPA is necessary if America is going to remain competitive.

“I was encouraged when Chairman Westerman introduced the SPEED Act. The bill reduces the statute of limitations and ensures that environmental reviews can satisfy federal requirements, saving both time and money. The bill also ensures federal dollars cannot solely trigger federal environmental reviews, streamlining the federal grant process, so that we can get grant money out of the bank and into the ground. These are exactly the types of reforms America needs to build energy infrastructure responsibly and efficiently.

“Earlier this month, I led a letter with 30 Democratic colleagues outlining our support for permitting reform and the specific changes needed to earn additional Democratic support for this bill. In the letter, we emphasized four key areas that must be addressed for broad bipartisan support.

“We emphasized that projects that comply with the law must be protected from political interference, that courts should have a targeted role to ensure decisions are based on accurate analysis, and that local stakeholders should continue to have meaningful input early in the process. We also highlighted the need to avoid provisions that could backfire, delay projects, or reduce the quality of environmental reviews. Our goal is simple: a permitting process that is efficient, predictable, and fair for investors, communities, and the environment alike.”

“We urgently need to get permitting reform done this Congress. I remain committed to continuing to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with the Senate to craft truly bipartisan solutions that can become law and help America build the clean, reliable energy infrastructure we need.”

Background: Rep. Peters has been a longtime champion of permitting reform in Congress and was encouraged to see the SPEED Act brought up before the House Natural Resources Committee in November. After passing out of Committee, Rep. Peters sent a letter signed by 30 of his House Democratic colleagues, to the Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Bruce Westerman, outlining what they’d like to see in the final bill. These concerns were not addressed before SPEED was brough to the House Floor.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid.
Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory.
“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom.","Calls are mounting for the largest US grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record of $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in the year starting June 2027, according to PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans. That fee will come on top of what consumers pay for the power they actually use, plus other line items on their bills such as charges for maintaining and expanding the power lines.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive build-out of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators. Vistra Corp., which rose as much as 2.7% in early trading Thursday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.6%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion, with shares up 2.7%.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesman Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities – Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. – will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

Utility company DTE Electric argued it needed quick approval to move forward with the energy-intensive project backed by tech companies OpenAI and Oracle.

Thursday’s decision takes advantage of a policy allowing projects to skip a deeper review, known as a contested case, if they won’t raise rates for other customers.

Michigan Public Service Commission chair Dan Scripps said contracts put the project on the hook for billions of dollars, regardless of if it pans out.

“This provides real protections that don’t exist in many other states to ensure that, if ultimately, this is a bubble, if this is all overblown and that the load doesn’t materialize, that again, even in that worst case scenario, customers are still protected,” Scripps said.

DTE would need to expand its energy capacity by a quarter for the data center. The project would require over a gigawatt of energy, more than an average nuclear reactor produces, according to U.S. Department of Energy estimates.

Opponents say they don’t trust that ratepayers won’t be left holding the bill. York Township resident Sarah Brabbs said no one has fully explained how the project will be held accountable.

“Who determined if that’s there. Is that there? We don’t know. But if it is, we don’t know who determined what it looks like. We don’t know who’s in charge of it. If it’s part of the dealmakers or is it someone else? What does that look like? How are you testing and making sure that they do what they say?” Brabbs said.

During the Public Service Commission meeting, attendees frequently heckled commission members. The vote faced massive backlash as attendees took issue over both environmental concerns and because the plan skipped the reviews that would’ve been part of a contested case.

Local resident Beth Foley said it was worth a deeper look.

“There is potential for egregious harm by fast tracking this with no downside in taking your time and ensuring you got it right,” she said.

The MPSC insists it did conduct a thorough review.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick said her board and their staff got to see several documents not available to the public, including unredacted versions of the contracts up for approval.

She said she was satisfied enough was there to keep Michiganders safe. Peretick argued because the companies and DTE would responsible for the infrastructure upgrades, the deal would benefit everyday ratepayers.

“The power supply agreement and energy storage agreement are well-negotiated contracts. They show a net financial benefit to DTE’s other customers of approximately $300 million per year,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b9315b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+37/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2Fc5%2F15925ecf4bc8ae5a5d3478466e94%2Fnrel-rsf-data-center.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 23:58:53.340404

Mendonça Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country's shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country's copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India's capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India's battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India's waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India's government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery's contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it's an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

SAO PAULO (AP) — “The Secret Agent,” a Brazilian feature shortlisted for the Oscars, is all about ordinary people. It follows an unassuming scientist and widowed father who becomes a target of Brazil’s military dictatorship in the 1970s — not because he is an activist or revolutionary, but because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.

“He’s in danger simply for being who he is, for holding the values he holds,” star Wagner Moura told The Associated Press in a recent interview. “That’s how authoritarianism works everywhere.”

Directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho, “The Secret Agent” has been hailed by critics as one of the year’s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendonça Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).

Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama. And it is on the shortlist for best international feature film at the 2026 Academy Awards.

“The Secret Agent” arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of “I’m Still Here,” which won this year’s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.

In Brazil, expectations for “The Secret Agent” are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film — and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists — has made him “incredibly happy.”

“No country develops without culture, without identity,” he said. “You’re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.”

Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil’s dictatorship, “The Secret Agent” opens with a black-and-white montage of the era’s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.

Mendonça Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.

“We’ve all consumed incredible things from so many places — from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,” Mendonça Filho said. “I am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it’s good, it will be universal.”

Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother’s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry — a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.

Mendonça Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.

One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director’s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of “Jaws” and “The Omen,” shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.

Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside “The Secret Agent” and “I’m Still Here,” filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as “Marighella,” directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.

Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil’s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.

Mendonça Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.

“The military is a trauma that was never truly examined,” he said. “You can’t just say, ‘Move on, forget it.’ A crust forms over it. The same thing happens to an entire nation.”

As “The Secret Agent” arrived in Brazilian theaters on Nov. 6, history was unfolding in real time.

That same month, Bolsonaro was arrested and began serving a 27-year prison sentence for attempting to overturn the 2022 election after losing to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. For the first time, high-ranking military officers were also imprisoned for their role in the attempted coup.

“Today, I’m much more optimistic about Brazil as a democracy,” Mendonça Filho said. “For the first time, we’re holding military officers accountable — and sending to prison a president who did nothing but harm the country.”

Few stories in “The Secret Agent” are as striking as that of Tânia Maria, 78, who plays Dona Sebastiana.

A Brazilian artisan, Maria lived an ordinary life until age 72, when she was cast as an extra in Mendonça Filho’s 2019 film “Bacurau.” Since then, she has appeared in six films that have yet to be released.

The director said he never forgot her presence — “a birdlike bearing, a voice shaped by 60 years of cigarettes and a razor-sharp sense of humor.” He later wrote the role of Dona Sebastiana specifically for her.

The character, who shelters political fugitives including Armando, stands out. When she walks toward the camera in a flowered dress, cigarette in hand, the film briefly belongs to her.

“Her authenticity carries something of many women I’ve known,” Mendonça Filho said. “There’s something literary about her.”

Moura said he wasn't able to hide his awe at the actor’s authenticity. He pointed to their first scene together, in which Dona Sebastiana shows Armando the apartment he is moving into.

If viewers watch closely, he said, they will see that he is genuinely “like a fool orbiting around her.”

Maria lives in a rural village of about 22,000 people in northeastern Rio Grande do Norte. There is no movie theater there. She says the only films she has ever seen are the ones she acted in.

For Maria, the authenticity of her performance begins with Mendonça Filho’s script.

“Filming is wonderful, and Kleber Mendonça’s films feel like they’re copying our lives,” she said, laughing. “Dona Sebastiana’s life is my life. I’ve always liked taking people in, and I’ve always liked complaining.”

Since the film’s release in Brazil, the seamstress-turned-actor has become a national sensation, appearing on morning shows and gaining thousands of followers.

She is also hoping for Oscar recognition — for the film and, perhaps, for herself.

“I want to go to the Oscars,” she said. “And I want to make my own dress. It will be red, very sparkly.”

The agency said the projects would secure affordable, reliable and clean energy sources — but declined to disclose the bid prices.

“The price is kept confidential while negotiations are ongoing,” a department spokesperson responded to queries from CT Examiner.

The selected projects will total approximately 67 megawatts of capacity, enough to supply 12,000 homes in the state, according to DEEP. The agency expects them to be online before the end of 2030.

In its press release, DEEP explained the selection was launched on September 10 and conducted expeditiously to choose advanced-stage projects that could capitalize on federal incentives while they’re still available.

“We are pleased to announce the selection of new grid-scale solar projects that can take advantage of federal tax credits before they expire to help provide affordable, reliable clean energy to Connecticut residents and businesses,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “By working together with New England and state partners, and working quickly to take advantage of competitively priced projects, we are able to secure greater affordability and reliability benefits for Connecticut at a fraction of the cost.”

The Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the Biden Administration, modified tax credits for carbon-neutral technologies, with changes that took effect in January this year. These changes introduced two types of benefits, of which developers could choose only one—an immediate 30% tax credit on the investment value or a tax credit of up to 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour produced over 10 years from the start of production.

The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed this year, determined that credits for solar and wind projects would be eliminated for projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 and projects that are not in service before the end of 2027. However, projects that begin or are completed before those two deadlines would not be affected.

The cost of renewable energy has been a political football in recent years. Critics blame renewable generation in part for the state’s high cost of electricity, among the most expensive in the country, while renewable energy advocates point to falling costs in recent years, and the need to decarbonize the state’s sources of energy.

Over the past 12 months, the wholesale price of electricity in Connecticut was just above 7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Other large-scale solar projects had costs that doubled that figure.

Revolution Wind, the first offshore wind project expected to start supplying power to Connecticut homes next year, has an agreed 10 cents per kilowatt-hour price in its purchase agreement.

State Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, introduced a proposal in the past legislative session that would have prohibited power purchase agreements at 150% above the wholesale price.

Regional collaboration

The selection of new solar projects was conducted through a multi-state process led by DEEP. Massachusetts and Maine participated, along with Vermont’s largest electric utility. Connecticut chose the largest capacity, accounting for 39% of the 173 megawatts selected collectively by the four states.

“Regional collaboration is critical to expanding and diversifying our energy supply, especially as we work to bring down the cost of electricity for Connecticut ratepayers,” Gov. Ned Lamont said, according to a press release issued by DEEP. “These resources can start providing power in the near future, sooner than any other new generation resources, and will help ensure we have a more reliable and affordable grid.”

Connecticut’s share of the project will be funded through contracts with utilities, subject to review by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.

Husky Solar, a 50-megawatt project, is the project that would be located in Connecticut, in the town of Plainfield. The state selected 25% of this project’s capacity, while the remainder was divided between Massachusetts and Maine.

Connecticut also selected two solar projects in Vermont; Viridis Solar, with 50 megawatts, and Fair Haven Solar, with 20 megawatts. Connecticut secured about 80% of each project’s capacity.

The state has significantly expanded its solar capacity over the past decade to nearly 1.7 gigawatts by 2024, enough to power about 245,000 homes, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Last year, when Connecticut decided to pass on selecting offshore wind energy in the tri-state auction held with Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the state announced the same day that it had opted for solar and batteries to increase capacity.",https://ctexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AdobeStock_290547138-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 23:59:07.465383

The Dec. 10 decision restores the Rooted in Comunidad, Cultivating Equity (RICCE) initiative — a Transformative Climate Communities (TCC) grant — to its originally proposed $29.5 million funding level, ensuring that all community-identified improvement projects can proceed as planned. The additional funding was made possible by the passage of Proposition 4 in 2024, which supports expanded investment in climate-related projects. The initiative is led by San Diego Foundation and the Environmental Health Coalition, working alongside 10 dedicated community partner organizations.

Developed through extensive community engagement in Barrio Logan, Logan Heights, Sherman Heights, Shelltown, Stockton, Grant Hill, Mount Hope and Southcrest, the project reflects priorities identified directly by residents, including:

Improved air quality near industrial corridors

Safer, more accessible streets and transit connections

Urban greening and expanded open space

Workforce development tied to climate-related careers

Increased affordable housing and anti-gentrification efforts

“This funding restoration demonstrates California’s commitment to supporting community-driven climate solutions, even during times of uncertainty,” said Mark Stuart, President and CEO of San Diego Foundation. “San Diego Foundation remains dedicated to being a steady, reliable partner for the residents of the historic barrios, ensuring that investments align with community priorities and that a healthier, more sustainable future can move forward as planned.”

The supplemental award restores California’s original level of support for the project following funding volatility that affected climate initiatives statewide:

The Rooted in Comunidad, Cultivating Equity initiative was initially awarded $22 million in 2023, with project partners encouraged to seek additional resources to close the remaining gap.

While federal funding for the initiative awarded through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 was later rescinded in 2025 as part of a national policy shift, the state of California’s action ensures stability for the community-driven work and allows implementation to proceed as planned.

“This funding is an initial step in restoring hope and trust in a community that wasn’t just devastated by the EPA funding cuts this year, but that has been underinvested in for generations,” said Jose Franco Garcia, Executive Director of Environmental Health Coalition. “This is a huge win for San Diego’s historic barrios, especially the over 400 community members who participated in the grant application process, helping identify which improvement projects will preserve, protect, and strengthen their community.”

California’s TCC program invests in neighborhood-level climate solutions in communities facing longstanding environmental and economic challenges. Projects are required to be developed with meaningful community input and to deliver measurable benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health and economic opportunity. The RICCE initiative represents one of four projects across the state selected for TCC funding in 2023.

With full state funding now secured, project partners are moving forward with implementation while continuing to explore additional resources to address the loss of federal support.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.

Science

Vol 390, Issue 6779

pp. 1210-1221

China’s turn to green energy dwarfs any other country’s, as a parade of astonishing numbers attests. In 2024 alone it installed new solar and wind generation equivalent to roughly 100 nuclear power plants, and the pace quickened early this year. Dozens of new, ultrahigh-voltage power lines are marching thousands of kilometers from western deserts where much of the solar energy is generated to the eastern cities where it is used. Hungrily awaiting the bounty of clean energy are millions of electric cars and a sprawling network of high-speed electric trains that can zip between cities 1000 kilometers apart in a morning.

China’s landscape reflects this metamorphosis. The vistas of smog, smokestacks, and coal heaps still exist, but glinting silicon panels now cover hills, deserts, and lakes. One solar farm on the Tibetan Plateau spans more than 400 square kilometers, an area more than twice the size of Washington, D.C. Wind turbines grow ever bigger; one meant for use offshore has blades 150 meters long. Arrays of house-size lithium batteries stockpile excess energy, and more is stored in mountaintop reservoirs, pumped full of water when energy is abundant and tapped as needed by allowing the water to cascade through turbines to a lower lake. The factories that produce the solar panels, turbines, batteries, and cars have added new industrial sprawl—but often without the smokestacks because they are electrified.

These days, the containers in China’s busy ports are packed with new wares: electric cars, solar cells, wind turbine blades. In building up its own green energy system, China has also created an export industry worth nearly $180 billion in 2024, putting low-cost renewable energy within reach for much of the rest of the world (see story, p. 1208). The revolution these images document is now going global. —Tim Appenzeller

The order directs PJM to offer customers who want to co-locate four options to manage how data centers and other large loads interact with the grid.
“We share FERC’s focus on clear and transparent rules as data centers expand their role as an engine of the U.S. economy.
Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said demand is outpacing the ability of the market alone to reliably and affordably serve data centers and existing customers.
Amazon announced an agreement to buy a data center development adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna Steam Electric nuclear power station in Luzerne County.","Federal regulators directed the operator of the nation’s largest electricity grid to establish transparent rules for AI data centers to connect directly to power plants.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the revisions will help to manage electricity costs as the race to develop artificial intelligence drives an unprecedented increase in electricity use across the country.

In Thursday’s meeting, the commission unanimously approved an order directing PJM Interconnection to revise its tariff — a compilation of rate schedules and terms of a particular company or utility — to detail the terms and conditions for customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load. The order directs PJM to offer customers who want to co-locate four options to manage how data centers and other large loads interact with the grid.

Montgomery County-headquartered PJM manages the wholesale electricity market and grid for about 65 million customers in Pennsylvania and 12 other states plus Washington, D.C.

US Energy Secretary says Three Mile Island restart delivers on Trump administration promises

“PJM has been actively engaged with stakeholders throughout 2025 to address the rapid growth of data centers and the related increase in demand for electricity,” spokesman Jeff Shields said in a statement.

Shields added the PJM board intends to move forward with a proposal to FERC derived from its own process in which stakeholders have provided their input on possible solutions.

“We share FERC’s focus on clear and transparent rules as data centers expand their role as an engine of the U.S. economy. PJM is reviewing the order and will assess how it impacts efforts already underway.”

FERC Chairperson Laura Swett said Thursday the decision would advance the nation in the AI and manufacturing revolution while safeguarding the prices consumers pay for electricity.

“While uncertainty has abounded across our country on how we will facilitate data centers, this morning, my colleagues and I are taking a critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem,” Swett said.

In February, FERC initiated a proceeding to review issues associated with the co-location of AI data centers, which can use as much electricity as a small city, and generators to ensure the clarity of the rates, terms and conditions of service that apply to co-location arrangements.

“Co-location arrangements are a fairly new phenomenon that entail huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs,” former Chairperson Mark Christie said in February. “Given these ramifications, the commission truly needs to ‘get it right’ when it comes to evaluating co-location issues.”

Advanced Energy United, an association for the renewable energy industry, said the order has potential to bring welcome regulatory clarity for large load customers and safeguards to minimize the impact of co-location on the electric rates and system reliability of all other customers.

Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said demand is outpacing the ability of the market alone to reliably and affordably serve data centers and existing customers.

“Advanced energy solutions like battery storage, solar, wind, demand response, and distributed energy resources are well-suited to reliability and affordably serve new large loads in PJM and across the country,” Marquis said. “The advanced energy industry will welcome new rules within PJM that empower large load customers to bring their own new clean energy to the system, benefiting all energy users.”

Co-location, the group noted, is attractive to AI hyperscalers because it can result in faster connections for data centers, which companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are competing to bring online first.

Microsoft has a $1.6 billion deal with Constellation Energy to restart the remaining nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Dauphin County to power its data centers elsewhere in the PJM service area. Amazon announced an agreement to buy a data center development adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna Steam Electric nuclear power station in Luzerne County.

Co-location also raises questions about who will pay for additional transmission infrastructure and how large loads or other customers will be affected by fluctuations in electricity supply across the grid.

Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents competitive power generators, said the order provides options, recognizing that there are a variety of approaches to co-locating large electricity users and generating stations.

“Clearly, this is the first step in a process that will require quick action and durable consensus from many stakeholders and highlights the urgency in getting solutions onto the system and for that we applaud FERC’s approach,” Snitchler said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img_6060-1024x7681766105653.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=1mFLeP7y,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:46.174997

There are various ways to index the downturn of the U.S. nuclear industry, but the starkest is probably by permits.
From 1954 to 1978, regulators issued a hundred and thirty-three construction permits for civilian nuclear reactors.
Although this now looks like a mixed bargain, at the time, the U.S. nuclear industry was only too happy to take it.
Kairos represents a new era for the U.S. nuclear industry.","This April, in a speech given at the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the physicist Xu Hongjie announced a breakthrough. For over a decade, his team had been working on an experimental nuclear reactor that runs on a lava-hot solution of fissile material and molten salt, rather than on solid fuel. The reactor, which went online two years ago, was a feat in itself. It is still the only one of its kind in operation in the world, and has the potential to be both safer and more efficient than the water-cooled nuclear plants that dominate the industry. Now, Xu explained, his team had been able to refuel the reactor without shutting it down, demonstrating a level of mastery over their new system.

As dazzling as that was, the timing of Xu’s speech also freighted the topic with geopolitical import. Only a few months earlier, DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial-intelligence company, had set alarms ringing through the U.S. tech world when it became clear that the relatively small Chinese startup, operating under U.S. export controls, had created a large language model that rivalled anything devised by the behemoths of Silicon Valley. Xu cast his team’s molten-salt reactor in the same light: yet another sign that the technology gap between China and the U.S. had closed.

Xu explained that his team had based their design on an experimental reactor that had been built in Tennessee in the nineteen-sixties. Known as the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment, or the M.S.R.E., that project hit a dead end in the early seventies, when it lost federal funding. Xu’s team had learned everything they could about the M.S.R.E. so that, decades later, they could bring the project back to life. Xu compared their labors to the story of the tortoise and the hare: whereas the United States had “gotten lazy and made a mistake,” China had seized the “chance to overtake” it.

In reality, China’s molten-salt reactor was less the product of a race than a collaboration. Less than ten years earlier, Xu’s team had been working with an array of American nuclear scientists. M.I.T. had irradiated graphite samples for the Chinese scientists. Nuclear engineers from Berkeley flew to Shanghai to review the original design. And by 2015, at what was perhaps the peak of U.S.-China amity in the sciences, Xu’s home institution, the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, or SINAP, had signed a coöperative research-and-development agreement with Tennessee’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the site of the world’s first molten-salt reactor.

These agreements could be seen as products of Reagan-era neoliberalism. They allow national labs to hire out their facilities and staff to outside entities that, in exchange for funding, can secure a proprietary claim to any technologies U.S. national labs discover while working on the designated project. For the most part, this has facilitated technology transfer from public institutions to the private sector. But the agreement between O.R.N.L. and SINAP created an unprecedented situation: a Chinese state-owned lab was paying an American lab millions of dollars to develop materials and plumbing for molten-salt reactors.

From the start, the American side operated under the belief that the Chinese would be the first to build a molten-salt reactor. China was spending the money to do it, after all. There was some funding for molten-salt research in America, but much less than was needed, and this was why the Oak Ridge researchers were willing to accept support from the Chinese. Through the partnership, the American researchers were hoping to advance work on a less complex reactor, in which molten salt would be used as a coolant rather than a fuel line. “The budget is what the budget is,” David Holcomb, Oak Ridge’s principal investigator for the agreement, explained during a conference appearance at the time.

Ten years later, the armature of assumptions and policies that enabled such a partnership has been blown apart. After Donald Trump won the 2016 Presidential election, the Department of Energy severed ties with SINAP and threatened to revoke licenses from American companies that exported nuclear technology to China. During Trump’s second term, the Administration’s hostility toward China has only increased. “If you write about the coöperative research agreement, the new Administration will fire everyone for being evil collaborators,” a senior figure at a U.S. nuclear company told me. He was only half joking. When I requested information about molten-salt research at Oak Ridge, the media-relations manager there told me “we won’t be able to help you this time,” and later minimized the extent of the facility’s coöperation with SINAP. After a brief back-and-forth with Idaho National Laboratory and Los Alamos about interview requests for David Holcomb, who has since moved to the private sector, and for Thomas Mason, who had been the head of Oak Ridge during its partnership with SINAP, both laboratories stopped responding to my messages. This reticence stands in contrast to the atmosphere a few years ago, when Holcomb gave multiple interviews to the press, and Oak Ridge allowed tours of the facility that had originally housed its molten-salt reactor.

My two e-mails to Xu Hongjie similarly went unanswered. Then, in November, Xu passed away, reportedly dying while at work at his desk.

The days of “common interest” and “open science,” invoked by Holcomb in 2015, have given way to new mantras of “geostrategic influence” and “national security.” These talking points, which have been embraced by Republicans and Democrats alike, call on nationalism to reboot an industry withered by decades of retrenchment. It remains to be seen if this is enough to make the U.S. nuclear industry competitive in international markets, or even profitable domestically.

To make sense of what is happening in nuclear energy today, it helps to know about what was once called “the first nuclear era”—a thirty-seven-year stretch between 1942, when Enrico Fermi oversaw the first controlled fission chain reaction, and 1979, when the second reactor at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, in southeastern Pennsylvania, partially melted down. At the height of this period, around 1960, the United States accounted for almost seventy per cent of global spending on R. & D. Nuclear energy, which sat at the nexus of defense and civil engineering, was a double beneficiary. From these investments came a series of ever more terrifying weapons alongside a fleet of experimental and commercial reactors that made the U.S. the world’s largest producer of nuclear energy. America still holds this title, but China is poised to assume the mantle, probably sometime around 2030.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment epitomized the possibilities of this period. The concept originated in the late nineteen-forties, with a request from the Air Force to develop a nuclear-powered airplane. Alvin Weinberg, who later became the director of research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, didn’t think that such an aircraft would fly, but he was willing to try to build one. He had helped develop the reactors that produced plutonium for the Manhattan Project and moved to East Tennessee, after the war. There, he presided over the development of O.R.N.L., which grew from a plutonium-production facility near the Clinch River. For Weinberg, the purpose of a national lab was to try “things too difficult or too risky for private industry to undertake.” An airplane that burned uranium was precisely that.

Weinberg wrote that the reactor would need to reach temperatures around fifteen hundred degrees Fahrenheit in order to power a jet engine. His team surmised that such heat would mangle any fuel rods small enough to install into an aircraft, so they decided to use fluoride salts. These melted into a liquid at around four hundred degrees Celsius and stayed stable above sixteen hundred degrees. With uranium fluoride mixed in, the molten salt itself could function as fuel.

The system went critical in November, 1954. In its brief life, it showed some remarkable properties, but the test also revealed some of the challenges of working with molten salt. Leaks were a constant problem, and the radiotoxicity of most of the apparatus made repairs next to impossible. As a stopgap, Weinberg’s team had to repeatedly off-gas the reactor compartment, bathing a nearby forest in radioactive xenon and iodine. At the hundred-hour mark, the project was shut down.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment gave him another shot. By then, the Atomic Energy Commission was ready to make major investments in order to develop breeder reactors, or reactors that produce more fissile material than they burn. Breeder reactors promised energy on a scale far beyond what could be provided by the global supply of coal and oil, fuels that were projected to become scarce within a century and which were already suspected of warming the Earth. Planning began in 1960, and five years later Weinberg’s team loaded sixty-nine kilograms of enriched uranium into the salt. This time, the experiment was a success. The M.S.R.E. logged over thirteen thousand operational hours, during which the researchers ran countless tests. “​​They did, like, every calculation you could have done at the time to understand how you would build and run and fuel this reactor,” Katy Huff, the Assistant Secretary of Nuclear Energy under President Joe Biden, said. The most important finding was a simple one: the M.S.R.E. proved that a molten-salt reactor was viable.

Weinberg had hoped to move from the M.S.R.E. to a molten-salt breeder reactor. But in 1973 President Richard Nixon pulled federal funding for molten-salt research in order to go all-in on a competing breeder reactor that was cooled with sodium. In 1983, the sodium breeder, in turn, lost its funding. Plagued by budget overages, the project also fell victim to a conservative revolt, spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. By then, the public had also soured on nuclear-energy projects, owing to the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, in 1979.

There are various ways to index the downturn of the U.S. nuclear industry, but the starkest is probably by permits. From 1954 to 1978, regulators issued a hundred and thirty-three construction permits for civilian nuclear reactors. Between 1979 and 2012, they issued none. “There’s been almost no real work on nuclear power since the seventies,” Nathan Myhrvold, who sits on the board of TerraPower, a nuclear-technology company that he co-founded with Bill Gates, told me. “The Department of Energy still had some research programs going, and I don’t want to slight anyone who was in one of those things. But they stopped building plants. When you stop building plants, it makes it very hard for companies to justify the enormous number of engineers it takes.”

“The thing that struck me the first time we went to China, in particular, is they assigned an awful lot of people to the problem,” Charles Forsberg, a research scientist at M.I.T., told me. “And if you assign several hundred engineers to the problem you will learn very, very rapidly.” Forsberg spent his early career as a researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory before moving to M.I.T., where he is overseeing the construction of a molten-salt loop that will run along the side of the campus’s research reactor. He is also one of three engineers who, in 2002, hashed out the concept for a fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor, or F.H.R. That involved taking Weinberg’s molten-salt reactor and swapping the liquid-fuel loop for a more conventional core design, while still using molten salt as a coolant. This change simplified the most vexing problems, of corrosion and containment, while preserving the high process heat that molten salt makes possible. The F.H.R. has played a significant role in rekindling interest in molten salt for fission reactors in the United States—which is the reason that Forsberg initially travelled to China to meet with the SINAP team.

Forsberg’s travel, and the relationship that he developed with Xu Hongjie and other researchers at SINAP, took place at the outset of a relatively recent period of collaboration between the U.S. and China. The partnership was formed under the framework of a 2011 “memorandum of understanding” between the Department of Energy and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which provided for coöperation on nuclear technologies. That agreement was based on a previous agreement, from 2006, which had cleared the way for U.S. nuclear firms to sell reactors to China. Both stemmed from the desire of each country to leverage the other to revamp its own nuclear industry.

China had only a handful of reactors in the early two-thousands, but in 2007 its planners had vowed to massively increase nuclear-energy production by 2020. That meant building something like forty new reactors in about fifteen years—a pace and scale only matched by the U.S. nuclear industry in the twentieth century. To meet that goal, China intended to buy the first fleet of new reactors from foreign companies, under contracts that required significant technology transfer. Although this now looks like a mixed bargain, at the time, the U.S. nuclear industry was only too happy to take it. The industry had just weathered a quarter century of effectively zero domestic demand for new reactors, and had hundreds of experts unable to put their skills to use. These were “a bunch of old Navy nuke guys, or guys that studied nuclear engineering forty years ago, who knew a ton about aging management and cracking piping and corroding pumps and things like that,” David Fishman, then a partner at a boutique China-based nuclear consultancy, told me. “They were just so pleased to come over and find a young, eager market and industry that was planning to build dozens of reactors.”

U.S.-China coöperation on molten-salt research proceeded under conditions not so different from the commercial melee. Forsberg and his collaborators—Per Peterson, a nuclear engineering professor at Berkeley, and Paul Pickard, formerly of Sandia National Laboratories—had pursued their design through academia for years, using oil or water to simulate molten salt, which is expensive and difficult to acquire in the United States. Then, in 2011, they were awarded a major multi-university grant from the Department of Energy which ultimately allowed them to start running tests with the real thing. That became a useful point of connection for Xu and his team, who had recently received a major grant from the Chinese government. The SINAP group was created to build a liquid-fuel reactor, with hopes of eventually fulfilling Weinberg’s vision of making a thorium breeder. To create some common ground with the Americans, they also committed to building a salt-cooled reactor like the F.H.R.—the project that the D.O.E. was most interested in at the time.

You can see the early dynamic of U.S.-China coöperation play out in a video of SINAP’s first presentation at Berkeley, delivered in August, 2012. As the institute’s representative, SINAP sent Kun Chen, who had done his Ph.D. at Indiana University and was still in his thirties. The audience skewed much older: about two-thirds of them looked to be in their fifties or sixties. The attendees tried to suss out the practicality of SINAP’s ambitious plan. One man asked about the budget, which was about three hundred and fifty million dollars, spread over five years. Another man asked where SINAP planned to get molten salt, since “to my understanding, there are no facilities in the world that can produce” it. Chen replied that China had several facilities that could.

It’s hard to tell from the video what the Chinese side got out of these exchanges, but when I spoke with Chen he stressed how helpful it was to have interlocutors in the U.S. “From the start, we didn’t believe we could get this far,” he said. Molten salt was no less niche in China than it was anywhere else. Chen estimated that, back in 2011, there were only thirty or forty people in the whole world working seriously on using the substance for fission reactors. Connecting with some of those individuals in the U.S. made the project seem possible.

For the Americans, there was the curiosity of seeing how far the Chinese could go with resources that simply didn’t exist here. Coöperating with SINAP was also a way to prod the U.S. federal government. The logic was “If the Chinese are doing it, it must be relevant,” Forsberg said.

In that sense, the coöperative research-and-development agreement that Oak Ridge signed with SINAP cut out the middleman. To fund the molten-salt loop, SINAP paid Oak Ridge around four million dollars, according to Chen. With such a loop, researchers could test materials and all the plumbing components needed to circulate molten salt. The project also gave a focal point to people working on molten salt in the U.S. Speaking to a reporter from the MIT Technology Review, David Holcomb explained his motivations. “One of the important things to realize is that a number of key people in molten-salt reactors are retiring very fast or passing away,” he said. “China is providing the funding that allows us to transfer that knowledge, to gain practical experience at building and operating these reactors.”

That article ran in August, 2016. By 2018, the U.S. had withdrawn from almost all coöperation with China. “I wouldn’t say it’s a total surprise,” Chen told me. He and the SINAP team figured that the relationship would probably deteriorate under Trump. “But it was just happening very suddenly. It’s similar to what we have learned in the tariff issue.”

I asked Chen if he ran into any challenges once his team was going it alone. “The challenges are, I think, mostly, first of all, if you have the money,” he said. But the SINAP team certainly had that. The Chinese Academy of Sciences had been extending the project’s grant every year. By 2018, China promised three billion dollars for molten-salt reactors over the next two decades, while Chinese planners have called for a $1.3 trillion investment in nuclear energy as a whole by 2050.

During Chen’s first presentation at Berkeley, in August, 2012, one of the few young people to ask him a question was a man with a shock of dark brown hair and an ample goatee. I had watched the recording several times before I realized the man was Mike Laufer, who would go on to help found Kairos Power, a privately held nuclear company that is attempting to commercialize the fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor originally designed by Forsberg, Pickard, and Peterson, who is also a co-founder of Kairos. Once I recognized Laufer, his question to Chen, about “the biggest challenges or obstacles to overcome” in order to build a salt-cooled reactor, had a new resonance. Was Laufer, who at the time was a graduate student at the university, already putting together a business plan?

Kairos represents a new era for the U.S. nuclear industry. Inspired by SpaceX, it is effectively trying to rebuild U.S. industrial capacity within a single company. The business model calls for a vertically integrated network of facilities that can fabricate fuel and salt for Kairos, and can manufacture a large share of what the company needs to build its reactors. The hope behind all this is that by running things internally Kairos will be able to offer nuclear energy at a competitive price in the market. And it has had some success. Last year, Google committed to buying five hundred megawatts from the firm by 2035. Kairos is also one of only two U.S. companies with a permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a new reactor. Construction of the reactor building, located in Oak Ridge, broke ground last year. “We’re working to get that reactor up and running this decade,” Laufer told me.","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/69431caccd2701eb86520635/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jones_ThoriumReactor_GettyImages-639357208.jpg",N,,2025-12-18 23:58:07.959163

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.

The bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.

Critics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines and wind and solar projects on federal land.

Speaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA, but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.

“What was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said.

After the bill’s passage through the House on Thursday, the SPEED Act’s Democratic cosponsor, Golden, praised the bill’s success.

“The simplest way to make energy, housing, and other essentials more affordable is to make it possible to actually produce enough of it at a reasonable cost,” Golden said in a press release following the vote. “The SPEED Act has united workers, businesses, and political forces who usually oppose each other because scarcity hurts everyone.”

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill aims to reform the NEPA process in several key ways. First, it makes changes to the ways agencies comply with NEPA—for example, by creating exemptions to when a NEPA review is required, and requiring agencies to only consider environmental impacts that are directly tied to the project at hand.

It would also drastically shorten the deadline to sue a federal agency over its permitting decision and constrain who is eligible to file suit. Current law provides a six-year statute of limitations on agency decisions for permitting energy infrastructure, and two years for transportation project permits. Under the SPEED Act’s provisions, those deadlines would be shortened to a mere 150 days and only allow lawsuits to be filed by plaintiffs who demonstrated in public comment periods that they would be directly and negatively impacted by the project.

NEPA does not require the government to make particular decisions about whether or how to move forward with a project based on a review’s findings. However, critics argue that in the decades since its passage, interest groups have “weaponized” the NEPA process to delay or even doom projects they oppose, sometimes forcing agencies to conduct additional analyses that add costly delays to project timelines.

Strange Bedfellows on Either Side of the Bill

Although climate activists and environmental groups have used NEPA to oppose fossil fuel projects, such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, oil and gas interests are far from the only group seeking respite. Some voices within the clean energy industry have called for permitting reform too, arguing that delays stemming from the current permitting process have had a negative impact on America’s ability to build out more climate-friendly projects, including some offshore wind projects and transmission lines to connect renewables to the grid.

So when Westerman and Golden introduced the SPEED Act in the House, a hodgepodge of odd alliances and opposition groups formed in response.

The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, launched a seven-figure advertising campaign in recent months pushing lawmakers to pursue permitting reform, according to a report from Axios. And the bill also initially enjoyed support from voices within the clean power industry. However, last-minute changes to the bill—designed to win over Republican holdouts—undermined the SPEED Act’s cross-sector support.

The bill’s opponents had previously raised alarm bells that fossil fuel interests would disproportionately benefit from a more streamlined review process under the current administration, citing President Donald Trump’s ongoing war against wind and solar energy projects.

In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to pause, reconsider or revoke already approved permits for renewable energy projects it dislikes. Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.

A bipartisan amendment to the SPEED Act, added during the Natural Resources Committee’s markup in November, sought to address some of those concerns by adding language that would make it more difficult for the administration to “revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere” with an existing authorization.

However, that measure encountered resistance from key Republican voices who support Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects.

A Last-Minute Loophole for Trump’s Energy Agenda

On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in the Rules Committee were able to amend the SPEED Act in a way that would facilitate the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to axe renewable energy projects. The changes were spearheaded by Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), two vocal proponents of Trump’s energy policies. The amendment fundamentally undermined the technology-neutral aspirations of the bill—and any hope of receiving widespread support from moderate Democrats or the clean power industry.

According to Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, Harris and Van Drew’s amendment would allow the administration to exclude any project from the bill’s reforms that the Trump administration had flagged for reconsideration—something the administration has done repeatedly for renewable projects like offshore wind.

The result, Davis argued, is that the bill would speed up the environmental review process for the Trump administration’s preferred sources of energy—namely oil and gas—while leaving clean energy projects languishing.

“They couldn’t pass the rule on Tuesday to even consider this bill without making it even better for the fossil fuel industry and even worse for the clean energy industry,” Davis said.

In a public statement following Thursday’s vote, Davis described the amended SPEED Act as “a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk to help big polluters.”

The American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable energy industry, previously hailed the bill as an important step forward for the future of clean energy development. But after the Rules Committee’s changes on Tuesday, the organization dropped its support.

“Our support for permitting reform has always rested on one principle: fixing a broken system for all energy resources,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a Wednesday statement. “The amendment adopted last night violate[s] that principle. Technology neutrality wasn’t just good policy—it was the political foundation that made reform achievable.”

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a nonprofit trade and advocacy organization, echoed that sentiment.

“Durable, bipartisan, technology-neutral permitting reforms that support and advance the full suite of American electricity resources and the necessary expansion of transmission infrastructure to get that electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed are essential to meeting that challenge reliably, securely, and most importantly, affordably,” said ACORE CEO Ray Long. “Unfortunately, the changes made on the House floor are a disappointing step backward from achieving these objectives.”

Following the SPEED Act’s passage through the House on Thursday, advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) issued a public statement praising the bill’s success while noting how the recent amendments had affected the law.

“While we are concerned that post committee additions to the bill could put the certainty of a range of projects at risk, this bill’s underlying reforms are critical to advancing American energy,” CRES President Heather Reams said in the statement.

Mixed Expectations for the Reform’s Impact

Even before the move to strip protections for renewables from the bill, some critics—like Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—said that the legislation didn’t go far enough to curtail the president’s “all-out assault” against clean power, arguing that the bill does nothing to restore approvals that have already been canceled by the administration, and doesn’t address other roadblocks that have been put in place.

“The administration cannot be trusted to act without specific language, in my view, to protect the clean energy projects already in the pipeline and to prevent the Interior Secretary from unilaterally stopping projects that are needed to lower costs and improve grid reliability,” Levin told Inside Climate News in an interview ahead of the House vote.

Both Levin and Davis pointed to a July memo from the Department of Interior that requires all wind and solar projects on federal land to receive higher-level approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“The administration is not even returning the phone calls of project developers. They are not responding to applications being submitted,” Davis said. “That sort of approach is in stark contrast with the ‘white glove, concierge service’—and that’s a quote from the Trump administration—the service they are providing for fossil fuel companies to access our public lands.”

The SPEED Act’s opponents also dispute the idea that NEPA reviews are one of the primary causes of permitting delays, arguing that reports from the Congressional Research Service and other groups have found little evidence to support those claims.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute, in a September interview with Inside Climate News.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said, like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Debate over NEPA and the reform of the permitting process will now move into the Senate, where experts say the SPEED Act will likely undergo further changes.

“I think as the bill goes forwards in the Senate, we’ll probably see a neutral, across-the-board approach to making sure the process is fair for all technology types,” Xan Fishman, an energy policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center told ICN after Thursday’s vote.

Fishman stressed it would be crucial to ensure permits for projects wouldn’t suddenly be cancelled for political reasons, but said he was optimistic about how the SPEED Act would be refined in the Senate.

“It’s great to see Congress so engaged with permitting reform,” he said. “Both sides of the aisle see a need to do better.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2242254350-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:10.757368

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit.","The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec. 17 delivered a proposed rule to set 45Z clean fuel production credit guidance to the White House Office of Management and Budget. OMB review marks a final stage before a proposed rule is released for public comment.

According to information released by the OMB, the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) includes guidance regarding 45Z implementation, including the calculation of emissions factors for transportation fuel, the determination of clean fuel production credits, and producer registration.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly when compared to last year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.

Also in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is designed specifically to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions to meet the requirements of section 45Z.

The DOE in July 2025 issued a notice soliciting public comments on a preliminary plan for determining provisional emissions rates (PER) for the purposes of the 45Z clean fuel production credit. A PER must be determined for any fuel not addressed in the emissions rate tables.

According to information published by the OMB, the upcoming NPRM is expected to address public comments gathered by Treasury and the IRS in response to the January 2025 notices. “These notices were published in early 2025 to meet the statutory deadline of January 1, 2025, however the rules need to be further formalized in an NPRM and then finalized,” according to the OMB’s summary of the NPRM.

""Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project,"" the company said.
Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its decision to suspend development, which marks an abrupt shift by the developer.
Energy Transfer, which said it wanted to sell down about 80% of the equity in the Lake Charles project, had also said it was in advanced talks with potential partners.
Earlier this year, Energy Transfer had expanded its long-term contract with offtaker Chevron to 3 million mt/year and signed a long-term deal with Japan's Kyushu Electric for 1 million mt/year.","Energy Transfer has suspended the development of its proposed 16.5 million metric ton/year Lake Charles LNG export project in Louisiana, the company said Dec. 18.

The US pipeline giant announced the move in a brief statement, saying it made the decision ""to focus on allocating capital to its significant backlog of natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects that Energy Transfer believes provides superior risk/return profiles."" In a separate statement, the company said it has increased the diameter of its planned Desert Southwest Pipeline to 48 inches in response to strong demand in a recent open season.

The company suggested it would be open to turning the Lake Charles project over to another developer.

""Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project,"" the company said.

The decision to halt development of Lake Charles comes amid expectations of an LNG oversupply in the late 2020s and early 2030s, around the time the long-delayed project was expected to come online.

Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its decision to suspend development, which marks an abrupt shift by the developer.

In early November, Energy Transfer said it was ""very close"" to realizing its target of signing 15 million-15.5 million mt/y of project volumes under long-term contract.

Some of the deals it had signed were preliminary agreements that the developer still needed to convert into binding deals.

Energy Transfer, which said it wanted to sell down about 80% of the equity in the Lake Charles project, had also said it was in advanced talks with potential partners. Energy Transfer co-CEO Marshall McCrea had described the targeted sell-down as ""the last big, most important box"" before launching the project, speaking during a Nov. 5 earnings call.

Counterparties included the US-based LNG player MidOcean, which is managed by EIG and backed by Saudi Aramco. Energy Transfer in April signed a preliminary deal that would have seen MidOcean commit to funding 30% of the construction costs of the project and receive the same share of LNG offtake from the facility, or about 5 million mt/year.

Earlier this year, Energy Transfer had expanded its long-term contract with offtaker Chevron to 3 million mt/year and signed a long-term deal with Japan's Kyushu Electric for 1 million mt/year.

This year, final investment decisions on new US liquefaction projects have already reached an all-time high. Six US LNG projects have reached an FID in 2025, bringing the total liquefaction capacity approved this year to around 60 million mt/y. US projects represent a majority of the 84 million mt/y to reach FID globally during the year.

Desert Southwest

Upsizing the Desert Southwest Pipeline from 42 inches to 48 inches will increase capacity to ""up to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day, depending on final compression configuration,"" Energy Transfer said.

Desert Southwest is an expansion of the Transwestern Pipeline system. It involves roughly 516 miles of greenfield pipeline running from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Phoenix area in Arizona. Its planned in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2029 is unchanged.

When Energy Transfer reached FID on the project in August, it planned for a 42-inch pipeline and a capacity of 1.5 Bcf/d. At the time, executives expressed confidence that it could be upsized, even though the original 1.5 Bcf/d had not yet been fully subscribed.

Energy Transfer increased the size after a supplemental open season. ""There is significant demand growth in the Desert Southwest region, including the potential to retire and or convert coal-fired power plants to natural gas, which could further benefit the project,"" it said. ""The ultimate capacity of the Desert Southwest expansion project will be based on market demand.""

Shippers on Desert Southwest include Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project and Arizona G&T Cooperatives.

The expansion will ""enable us to meet the region's growing power needs and strengthen Arizona's energy infrastructure,"" Bobby Olsen, SRP's chief power system executive, said in the statement.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 19:59:18.003301

“We’re proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.” About Entergy Arkansas Entergy Arkansas provides electricity to approximately 735,000 customers in 63 counties.
We’re also investing in cleaner energy generation like modern natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy.","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Entergy Arkansas today announced Next Generation Arkansas, the company’s comprehensive plan to provide electricity that does more for Arkansas by strengthening reliability, expanding energy supply, driving economic growth and keeping power affordable for all customers. The company, and its more than 2,800 employees, are focusing the plan and their efforts in the coming years on helping keep the state and its customers out in front of the emerging electric future developing in the U.S. and globally.

“Next Generation Arkansas is about preparing our state for what’s ahead. By strengthening the grid, adding new generation and modernizing how we deliver power, we’re making the system more reliable and more affordable while also building a system that enables unprecedented growth over the long term,” said Laura Landreaux, Entergy Arkansas president and CEO. “These investments help prevent outages, support new jobs and ensure that Arkansas families and businesses continue to benefit from low, predictable electricity costs as our state grows.”

Next Generation Arkansas is a multi-faceted plan that includes input from state and local leaders and Entergy Arkansas customers across the state to ensure transparency, accountability and open dialogue about affordability and how to best meet their needs. The plan represents the company’s response to several power-related issues facing the state:

Recent state growth requiring more power to serve customers;

More extreme weather in recent years affecting customer reliability;

Increasing state competitiveness for job-creating projects; and

Cost pressures requiring new approaches to keep rates low for customers.

To meet this demand, Next Generation Arkansas has been built around four core priorities, detailed below.

Better power for Arkansas: Fewer outages, faster repairs

Entergy Arkansas is launching one of the most ambitious reliability improvement plans in recent history designed to make the power grid stronger and more reliable with an initial goal to reduce power outages by at least 30% over the coming years.

In addition to increasing vegetation investments that will keep power lines clear, the company is performing reliability improvement projects across the state and deploying new, advanced technology tools that will help spot problems faster, prevent challenges and improve power quality for decades to come.

The economic growth the company is helping enable is adding new large customers to the grid that helps offset the costs of these improvements for existing customers.

More power for Arkansas: Power when and where needed to meet soaring demand

Arkansas was recently ranked the fastest-growing state economy in America for two quarters in a row, the No. 1 state for inbound movers, and the state with the lowest cost of living. Arkansas is already expected to see more than a 35% increase in power needs in the next five years, and with projections showing that figure could more than double, Entergy Arkansas is acting now to build the next generation of power sources to support the state’s growth and serve its customers while keeping rates affordable.

To do this, Entergy Arkansas plans to invest in approximately 2,600 MW of new, more fuel-efficient generation resources and repower approximately 1,600 MW of existing generation in the next five years pending approval from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, including:

Investing in new, modern natural gas plants to increase fuel efficiency by up to 40%, which lowers fuel charges on customer bills:

450 MW at the new Ironwood Power Station natural gas plant in Hot Spring County (2028).

750 MW at the new Jefferson Power Station natural gas plant in Jefferson County (2029).

600 MW of solar + 350 MW of battery storage at the Arkansas Cypress facility in Jefferson County (2028), which will provide clean, renewable power that lowers fuel charges on customer bills.

Retrofitting coal-fired generators to burn natural gas and extend their lives.

Investing in upgrades at existing natural gas facilities to increase output more than 150 MW.

Renewing the license to generate 1,800 MW of clean, reliable 24/7 energy produced by the Arkansas Nuclear One power plant and investing in new, more efficient plant equipment that increases the output of the facility.

These investments will ensure Arkansas has a balanced, more cost-efficient, “all-of-the-above” energy mix needed to support homes, businesses and new industries.

Job power for Arkansas: Helping the state recruit more and better jobs

Arkansas offers a strong pro-business environment, and over the past five years, Entergy Arkansas has partnered with state and community leaders to drive the creation of more than 7,500 jobs and over $13 billion in capital investments. As electricity becomes a key factor in securing new business, the state must continue delivering the power infrastructure and site development needed to compete. When structured strategically, these private investments not only generate tax revenue and quality jobs, but also provide broader benefits for Arkansans, including bill savings and a more reliable grid. The company plans to do this by:

Using the blueprint created by the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025 to work at the speed needed to compete nationally for once-in-a-generation tech and industrial projects.

Bolstering local job impact – Arkansas building Arkansas – by using local contractors and companies around the state whenever possible, reinvesting growth back into our communities through new jobs, state and local tax revenue, and indirect economic impact.

Creating economic impact while implementing the plan – for example, the development of the Ironwood, Jefferson Power Station and Arkansas Cypress power plants would create approximately 1,860 direct jobs as well as significantly more indirect jobs during construction, provide 46 permanent jobs during operation, and that will generate more than $105 million in new local and state tax revenue by 2030.

“We want to commend state leaders for passing the Generating Jobs Act of 2025, which is a landmark legislation and shows what’s possible when Arkansas sets a bold vision for its future, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission for approving the new associated rider,” Landreaux said. “Because of the state’s leadership, Arkansas has the tools to compete for once-in-a-generation opportunities. We are committed to delivering a power system that attracts new jobs, strengthens communities, and keeps our state moving forward for the next generation of Arkansans.”

Affordable power for Arkansas: Keeping rates low and predictable

Entergy Arkansas’s rates remain 22% below the national average, and the company plans to continue finding ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and offer innovative bill solutions to keep power affordable for all customers, even as the company invests in the state’s growth including:

Leveraging new policies to help build the power system Arkansas needs while keeping rate stable and predictable.

Using new technologies to help manage the grid and prevent outages at less cost to customers.

Providing customers with ways to lower their bills with new rate structures and by helping them access resources like free home energy checkups, free and discounted energy-saving products, and rebates on energy-efficient equipment purchases.

Continuing to recruit new large industrial customers to help spread the cost of maintaining and upgrading the power grid across a larger customer base and reduce the burden on residents and small businesses.

Working with new large customer partners to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives and encourage others to provide community support, as Google has with its $25 million Energy Impact Fund.

All of these efforts will be managed with transparency for customers and with direct oversight from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Landreaux said.

“Our 2,800 Entergy employees in Arkansas and I understand that this is some of the most important work of our careers, and we feel it personally because we’re Arkansans too,” Landreaux said. “We’re proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.”

The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act (H.R. 1366) streamlines critical mineral production and creates the Abandoned Hardrock Mine Fund to support an abandoned hardrock mine cleanup program created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.

“The bill I passed in Congress today puts Nevada’s natural resources to work for Nevadans,” Rep. Horsford said. “Streamlining the hardrock mining process will create good jobs and strengthen our energy sector. At the same time, this legislation delivers more resources for the Silver State to clean up past mining-related contaminants in our environment. The result is more jobs, a stronger economy, and an opportunity for a cleaner Nevada moving forward.”

“Strengthening our domestic mineral supply chain isn’t optional, it’s demanded to ensure we don’t fall further behind China,”Rep. Amodei said. “Western states are sitting on a wealth of resources and a critical opportunity to break our dangerous reliance on foreign adversaries while powering our own economy. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act restores decades of established precedent, repairs a permitting process undermined by the Rosemont decision, and gives domestic mining operations the certainty they need to compete aggressively and win. I’m glad to see the House pass this bill once again with bipartisan support, and I urge the Senate to act swiftly to get it signed into law.”

“The bipartisan Mining Regulatory Clarity Act is foundationally important to ensuring the U.S. can use our vast domestic resources to build the mineral supply chains our economic and national security demand,” Rich Nolan, National Mining Association President and CEO said. “China has weaponized its mineral dominance and left no doubt about how untenable our import reliance has become. The urgency to address our minerals challenge has never been greater. This legislation ensures the fundamental ability to conduct responsible mining activities on federal lands. Regulatory certainty, or the lack thereof, will either underpin or undermine efforts to decisively confront our minerals crisis.”

“The Nevada Mining Association is in full support of the passage of the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act,” Amanda Hilton, Nevada Mining Association President said. “As the importance of strengthening domestic supply chains continues to grow, this legislation provides clear guidance for mine operations in Nevada and across the United States to responsibly produce the minerals needed here at home, support national security, and provide good-paying careers for American workers.”

The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act now moves to the U.S. Senate where Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto introduced companion legislation.

Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.
Thursday’s order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.
Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.
It requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation’s largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

But it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.

It also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.

Laura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday’s meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”

It would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.

Power plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday’s trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.

Jeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.

Thursday’s order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

For tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.

But utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.

FERC’s Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.

It requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.

That could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.

The order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.

To wrap it up… In every way, 2025 was a challenging year for protecting our coasts and ocean.","The Surfrider team, volunteers, and supporters knew from the onset that this year was not going to be easy. We expected efforts by the federal administration to weaken coastal and ocean protections, but what we experienced was unprecedented. From cutting regulations that limit pollution and development in our waterways, to rescinding funding for critical coastal and marine monitoring programs, to the most aggressive ocean sell-off to offshore oil drilling in more than half a century, the onslaught of challenges delivered by our federal government kept us busy.

Watch our 2025 year in review video

Then there were ‘drop everything’ unforeseen circumstances, like the LA fires, that for a while sucked the energy out of our grassroots efforts to be effective stewards of that coast. Meanwhile, the visible challenges persisted — plastic pollution, the water quality crisis on the US-Mexico border, and our rapidly eroding shorelines.

We could have tried to look past the obstacles that stood in the way of our mission in 2025, but that’s not what we do. Instead, we faced them head-on and played into our strengths even harder to protect what we love.

Surfrider has the unique ability to scale and adapt to be effective, from the halls of Congress all the way to your local beach. When there is little opportunity to be proactive on federal policies that protect our coasts and ocean in Washington, D.C., we continue to mobilize in Sacramento, Tallahassee, Eugene, Albany, and other state capitals across the country. While we have watched the momentum for a swift transition to renewable energy decline, our network of volunteers has activated to restore our coastlines, in the wetlands, dunes, and mangroves, as a nature-based solution to the changing climate.

In 2025, the Surfrider network doubled down on opportunities to make progress on the ground, in the local councils, and in the state capitols, while still defending the bedrock federal protections in place for our coasts and ocean. Several state plastic pollution prevention bills were passed after years of effort. We won more than 20 local campaigns across the country with the leadership of Surfrider’s chapters. Volunteers turned out in the tens of thousands to give nature a boost by restoring coastal ecosystems.

Despite the challenges and the absence of federal leadership for healthy coastlines, this was still a year of incredible impact for Surfrider and our coasts.

Here are some of Surfrider’s major achievements of 2025:

45 campaign victories were won at the local, state, and federal levels that improve water quality on our beaches, reduce plastic pollution, protect ocean ecosystems, and strengthen the resilience of our coastlines through nature-based solutions.

More than 23,000 Surfrider volunteers removed 120,633 pounds of trash and recycling from U.S. beaches and waterways.

More than 40,000 native plants were installed across 22 acres of coastal dunes and mangrove forests.

Through 97 Ocean Friendly Garden workdays, 2,905 native plants and trees were planted, achieving more than 26 acres of Ocean Friendly Gardens that filter 23.8 million gallons of runoff annually.

Volunteers conducted more than 10,000 Blue Water Task Force water quality tests at 613 sampling sites.

In 30 states and territories, 646 Ocean Friendly Restaurants served an estimated 42 million single-use plastic-free meals.

An estimated 1.8 million plastic water bottles and 2.7 million mini plastic toiletry bottles were saved from polluting our communities, waterways, and landfills by 40 Ocean Friendly Hotels.

Plastic Pollution

In 2025, the issue of plastic pollution on our beaches persisted, as noted by the 120,633 pounds of trash and recycling that were removed through Surfrider’s 831 cleanups. On the fifth of July alone, more than 10,000 pounds of trash were cleaned up. All of this was captured in Surfrider’s Beach Cleanup Report, which found that 83% of the 870,000 pieces of trash analyzed in 2024 were plastic.

Turning off the tap on plastic pollution is the only effective way to make an impact on this issue, and market solutions play a major role. This year, Surfrider’s Ocean FriendlyBusinesses network grew to 646 Ocean Friendly Restaurants in 30 states and territories, serving an estimated 42 million single-use plastic-free meals every year. New businesses were added as Ocean Friendly Hotels, now 40 in total, collectively eliminating about 1.8 million plastic water bottles and 2.7 million mini plastic toiletry bottles from polluting our communities, waterways, and landfills.

While the federal administration’s priorities blocked any efforts to pass meaningful plastic pollution reduction legislation in DC, Surfrider still successfully achieved 14 coastal victories in states and cities around the country. Together, these victories resulted in more than 862 million single-use plastic items taken out of circulation.

One example was Washington’s Recycling Reform Act, which reduces the amount of plastic pollution found on the state’s beaches and improves access to recycling. Another was in Oregon, where Surfrider successfully waged the Beyond the Bag Ban campaign, a statewide effort to eliminate thicker plastic check-out bags from grocery stores. Oregon is the second state in the US, after California, to pass a stronger bag ban.

Additionally, Surfrider defeated a dangerous Florida state bill that would have expanded the state's preemption on the local regulation of single-use plastic and reusable materials, containers, bottles, and bags. In the California cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola, Surfrider helped pass ‘Ban the Butt’ ordinances that end the sale of filtered tobacco products, the number one item found at Surfrider’s beach cleanups. In New Jersey, four local campaigns were won to require the containment and removal of plastic particles and dust at construction sites.

A lot of wins for eliminating needless plastic waste and the impacts it has on our coasts and ocean.

Coasts and Climate

There were significant threats at the federal level in 2025 to upend bedrock ocean protection laws, climate programs, and funding for coastal management. Even so, Surfrider demonstrated in real time how coastal communities and ecosystems can not only survive, but thrive with nature-based solutions. By working with nature and leaning into community voices and expertise, Surfrider worked swiftly to make real progress on local and state coastal resilience policy and project opportunities.

In 2025, Surfrider’s Climate Action Program came to life as a frontline defense against coastal erosion and the impacts of climate change. By restoring blue carbon mangrove forests, coastal dunes, and riparian habitats, Surfrider is adding decades of resilience to coastlines across the country while enhancing habitat and coastal access. A total of 76 restoration events were carried out across more than 22 acres of coastline in Hawaii, California, Florida, Puerto Rico, North Carolina, New York, New Hampshire, Maine, and Wisconsin, with the support of more than 2,000 volunteers. Collectively, these volunteers installed over 40,000 native plants and removed more than 85,000 pounds of invasives.

Meanwhile, the finishing touches were put on the Surfers’ Point Managed Retreat Project in Ventura, California. This project has become the gold standard in the application of nature-based solutions to address coastal erosion and climate change preparedness. By leveraging the success of Surfers’ Point and years of community organizing, Surfrider secured a state grant of $1 million to design and apply a similar approach to the rapidly eroding and beloved ‘Surf Beach’ at San Onofre State Beach in Southern California.

Surfrider won eleven local and state campaigns in 2025 to better equip our coasts for a changing climate. In Oregon, Surfrider advanced its multi-year Oregon Beaches Forever campaign aimed at safeguarding the state’s public beaches as they try to adapt to climate change. Four state and local wins were achieved in Oregon that advance nature-based solutions, promote climate-forward planning, and protect beaches against destructive riprap.

In Florida, Surfrider helped pass a state bill to provide long-term protections for state parks, including coastal areas, against harmful development projects. On the legal front, Surfrider’s amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) support led to a significant victory for California coasts in a case that properly limits armoring on California coastlines, consistent with the California Coastal Act.

To help scale proven coastal resilience, climate action, and nature-based tools, policies, and projects, Surfrider's 2025 State of the Beach Report highlighted case studies from around the country that can be replicated and applied along coastlines facing similar management challenges.

Clean Water

While protections for water quality at our beaches and waterways were also targeted by the federal administration’s efforts to reduce environmental regulations, in 2025, Surfrider worked tirelessly to safeguard the programs that keep us and our families safe when we visit the coast. Eleven clean water campaigns were won at the local, state, and federal levels. This includes having successfully advocated for congressional support for the EPA’s Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, or BEACH Act, which provides national grants to coastal states to run their beach water quality monitoring and public notification programs. The program is critical to provide families with the information they need to stay safe at the beach and to safeguard our valuable coastal economies.

At the state level, Surfrider helped pass a Washington bill that requires public notification of sewage spills. Other state bills that passed in 2025 include: solutions for new wastewater system technology in Hawaii; a ban on the use of Neonicotinoids, a class of synthetic, neurotoxic insecticides in Connecticut; and protections for recreational water quality against seafood processing wastewater discharge in Oregon.

Meanwhile, to address the ongoing public health and environmental crisis at the US-Mexico border, Surfrider and its coalition partners successfully advocated for more federal investment in border sewage infrastructure operations, maintenance, and capital improvements.

The role of Surfrider’s clean water programs has become more important than ever to help fill the gaps where governments are lacking the capacity or political will to address pollution issues. The Blue Water Task Force, the nation’s largest volunteer-driven beach water quality monitoring program, is now testing water quality at 613 sampling sites on beaches and waterways around the country. In 2025, volunteers ran more than 10,000 water quality tests. A total of 107,000 tests have been completed over the program’s 30-year history.

To identify and fix the sources of pollution identified through the Blue Water Task Force, multiple Surfrider chapters are working collaboratively in their local communities. This includes projects in San Mateo, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura Counties, California; Eastern Long Island, New York; Melbourne and Miami, Florida; Newport, Oregon; Kaua’i and O’ahu, Hawaii; and Rincón and Isabela, Puerto Rico.

Surfrider’s Ocean Friendly Gardens program is helping people across the country reimagine and transform landscapes, yards, and community green spaces with nature-based solutions that protect clean water, build biodiversity, and support climate resilience. In 2025, Surfrider led 97 Ocean Friendly Garden workdays during which volunteers planted 2,905 native plants and trees. Across the country, there are now more than 26 acres of Ocean Friendly Gardens that filter 23.1 million gallons of runoff annually.

Surfrider also developed a new digital resource, Re-planting After Fire: A Fire-Resilient Landscape Guide for Lahaina & West Maui, to help residents in the Maui community affected by the devastating 2023 fires create and maintain landscapes that are fire-resilient, environmentally responsible, and ocean-friendly.

Finally, Surfrider secured two significant legal wins in the courts for clean water in 2025. Hawai’i’s Supreme Court held in Surfrider and our partners’ favor in Kaua’i to help end the use of dangerous pesticides in Hawaii. Meanwhile, in another federal case, the courts concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must make better decisions when setting water pollution standards for industrial facilities.

Beach Access

In 2025, among the many unique challenges to beach access in the US, there were coastal erosion, Space X launches, the privatization of coastal parking, and climate change. Surfrider won six coastal victories to help address threats to coastal access in California, Texas, Florida, and Hawaii while monitoring dozens more.

In California, through the Love Your Beach tour, Surfrider mobilized the public to advocate against threats to weaken or abolish the state’s Coastal Act, a landmark law that protects the state’s 1,100-mile coastline. With stops from San Diego to Sacramento, the tour collected more than 1,500 signatures from 100 different California districts, all in support of the crucial coastal environmental and access protection law.

Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, Surfrider successfully supported the repeal of Florida legislation that preempted local jurisdictions from protecting the public’s customary use rights to recreate on Florida beaches.

Ocean Protection

On January 6, 2025, President Biden announced the withdrawal of the entire US East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and part of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska from future oil and gas leasing. The historic action protected more than 625 million acres of U.S. waters from oil and gas development. The Surfrider network celebrated this incredible victory.

However, following the change in administrations, the White House reversed President Biden's ban and initiated an onslaught of policies, proposals, and plans to sell off our ocean resources. Surfrider quickly filed litigation with our coalition partners to restore these protections. These cases remain ongoing and may extend for years, reinforcing the importance of Surfrider’s grassroots advocacy.

While persistently on the defensive, Surfrider helped achieve two major proactive ocean protection victories in 2025. The 582,570 square-mile Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Sanctuary in Hawaiʻi was established, becoming one of the largest marine protected areas in the world. The sanctuary safeguards coral reefs, seamounts, and shoals that are home to diverse marine wildlife, including invertebrates, fish, birds, and marine mammals, including many endemic species.

Surfrider helped strengthen the protection of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, home to the only barrier coral reef in the continental US, in addition to seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and diverse marine wildlife. The sanctuary’s Restoration Blueprint expands the sanctuary by 739 square miles to more than 4,530 square miles of protected marine ecosystems.

While these wins were significant, our ocean faced a dangerous new threat in 2025 — a brewing offshore drilling plan to open vast stretches of the U.S. coastline to new offshore oil and gas leases. The nearly 1.3 billion acres of ocean at risk in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s proposed five-year drilling plan, released in late November, include all federal waters off California, all of the western and portions of the eastern Gulf, and most of Alaskan waters, including the untouched High Arctic, where drilling has never been attempted because of the environmental hazards.

In anticipation of such a plan, Surfrider was ready and quickly mobilized a nationwide effort to demonstrate widespread public opposition to more offshore drilling on our coasts. Surfrider’s Drilling is Killing campaign is live, and will deliver tens of thousands of public comments to the agency through the deadline on January 23, 2026. Surfrider is engaging communities, businesses, and elected leaders in this critical comment period to build the public record of opposition to the plan.

As part of a coalition effort in California, Surfrider has organized people’s hearings in response to the absence of a public process in shaping the plan. Events in San Diego, Orange County, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Humboldt, and beyond are each turning out hundreds of ocean voices to advocate for ocean protection, and say no to new offshore drilling.

To wrap it up…

In every way, 2025 was a challenging year for protecting our coasts and ocean. New threats emerged while the persistent challenges to coastal conservation remained. Undeterred, the Surfrider network championed key coastal and ocean programs threatened with elimination or defunded by the federal administration while also taking local action on the ground.

Thanks to the dedicated volunteers, staff, and supporters from coast to coast, diverse and powerful voices were shared with our federal leadership on the importance of conserving our coastal resources. Meanwhile, every day, those same ocean defenders were safeguarding your beach through local solutions, in the field, and in the water.

We don’t expect 2026 to be any easier, but we do know that we are walking away from this year stronger than ever to confront the challenges that lie ahead.",https://www.surfrider.org/hubfs/Andrew%20Tonra.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:05.466146

PROVIDENCE, RI – Today the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4), chaired by Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) Director Terry Gray, approved the 2025 Climate Action Strategy. The Strategy is intended to guide implementation of the Act on Climate and provides a comprehensive assessment of Rhode Island’s emissions trajectory, programmatic tools, and the feasibility of achieving statutory greenhouse gas reduction mandates under current conditions. Developed in collaboration with the Office of Energy Resources (OER) including significant public input, the strategy outlines a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45% below 1990 levels by 2030.

“The Climate Action Strategy is the result of hard work by all the EC4 agencies and, in particular, the climate teams at OER and DEM. Over the last 14 months they have worked very closely with the experts at Energy, Environment, and Economics, Inc. (E3) who provided contract support and modeling. Throughout the process, we have engaged with many different communities to get meaningful input and feedback,” said DEM Director and EC4 Chair Terry Gray. “This strategy reflects a clear-eyed assessment of today’s landscape and the challenges ahead. Rhode Island was moving in the right direction under the Act, but our efforts are clearly impeded by considerable federal policy changes.”

“The EC4’s approval of this strategy charts a path forward for making progress towards the Act on Climate while recognizing new, significant challenges from the Trump administration,” said OER Acting Energy Commissioner Christopher Kearns. “The core of our climate work is increasing the share of zero-emission energy resources while maintaining electricity affordability for households. Supporting rate stability is a key foundation for meeting our emissions reduction goals, alongside continued investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, heat pumps, pre-weatherization, and energy-efficiency programs that are essential to sustaining progress.”

Since the Act on Climate was signed in 2021, new programs, laws, and regulations have supported the state’s emissions-reduction goals. RI has been a leader in offshore wind development and modeling showed that fully carrying out these initiatives as originally planned would’ve put the state on track achieve the 2030 reduction targets.

Recent federal actions – including tariffs, the rescission of Clean Air Act authorities supporting clean vehicles, the termination of Inflation Reduction Act clean-energy and electric-vehicle tax credits, efforts to stall offshore wind development, and the elimination of programs such as Solar for All – have significantly altered the landscape on which Rhode Island’s climate strategy was built. The updated strategy recognizes that these changes will have immediate and serious consequences for the state’s climate plans. Given these challenges, Rhode Island must adjust its climate planning efforts to reflect the new federal landscape. The EC4 is evaluating alternative paths to achieve meaningful emissions reductions while protecting ratepayers from unsustainable costs.

AUSTIN, Texas – The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) lauded passage of H.R. 4776, The SPEED Act, in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislative effort, supported by TIPRO, will streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969.

The following statement can be attributed to Ed Longanecker, President of TIPRO:

“On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers. For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges.

Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs. And communities waiting for the economic benefits of infrastructure development, including jobs, tax revenue, and improved local services, watch opportunity pass them by. In addition, the coming AI revolution, with the need to power massive data centers across the country, will drive further demand for American natural gas. When domestic production is throttled, imports from less regulated producers fill the gap, increasing global emissions and undermining U.S. environmental standards.

For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical. It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world. At a time when energy reliability and affordability are top concerns for working Americans, we strongly encourage expedited consideration in the U.S. Senate to help reshape the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure.”

Additional TIPRO analysis:

The SPEED Act: Reforming Federal Permitting to Accelerate Economic Development

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R. 4776, represents a bipartisan legislative effort to streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Introduced on July 25, 2025, by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and cosponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), the bill aims to reduce bureaucratic delays that have long hindered infrastructure, energy, and economic projects across the United States. By addressing inefficiencies in environmental reviews, the SPEED Act seeks to foster economic growth, enhance energy security, and support critical developments such as transmission lines, data centers, and manufacturing operations, while maintaining core environmental safeguards.

Key Provisions of the SPEED Act

The SPEED Act modifies NEPA to expedite approvals without eliminating environmental oversight. Notable provisions include:

Standardizing Review Processes: The bill redefines “major federal actions” to exclude designations based solely on federal funding and exempts actions already reviewed under equivalent federal, state, or tribal environmental laws.

Setting Deadlines: It imposes strict timelines for environmental assessments and impact statements, typically limiting reviews to one to two years, to prevent indefinite delays.

Limiting Judicial Review: Lawsuits challenging NEPA compliance must be filed within 150 days of final agency action, and courts are directed to remand cases for correction rather than halting projects entirely. This provision also restricts standing to parties who submitted comments during the public review process, curbing frivolous or politically motivated litigation.

Enhancing Agency Coordination: The legislation requires better interagency collaboration and focuses reviews on “proximate” effects directly caused by the project, excluding speculative or unrelated impacts.

These reforms are designed to balance environmental protection with economic imperatives, particularly in sectors like mining, energy production, and AI infrastructure, where permitting delays have historically increased costs and deterred investment. Supporters argue that the bill will unlock domestic resources, reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, and create jobs.

The SPEED Act is particularly vital for the oil and natural gas industry, where protracted NEPA permitting processes have significantly impeded exploration, infrastructure development, and overall energy security. Over the past five decades, NEPA has evolved into a complex framework burdened by court rulings, executive directives, and agency interpretations, resulting in unpredictable delays that deter investment, stifle innovation, and increase project costs. For oil and gas exploration, these delays have stalled federal leasing and project approvals, limiting access to domestic resources and exacerbating reliance on foreign imports, which undermines national energy independence.

In terms of infrastructure, the bill addresses barriers to constructing essential facilities such as pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, and drilling operations. Permitting bottlenecks have historically prevented timely market access for crude oil and natural gas, leading to higher flaring rates and inefficient resource utilization. By imposing reasonable timelines, reducing frivolous litigation, and streamlining interagency reviews, the SPEED Act enables faster development of these projects, ensuring they are delivered on budget and supporting more efficient production methods. This is crucial for meeting growing domestic and global energy demands, particularly amid rising needs from sectors like artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

On energy security, the legislation promotes the expansion of reliable, affordable American energy supplies, generating jobs and tax revenues while potentially reducing global emissions by displacing higher-emission foreign alternatives. Overall, by cutting red tape while preserving environmental protections, the SPEED Act positions the oil and natural gas sector to contribute more effectively to national security, economic growth, and a stable energy grid.

Senate action in 2025 remains uncertain and unlikely, however reform could gain traction in 2026 as part of larger legislative packages, such as energy security or infrastructure bills, amid partisan debates on environmental policy. Advocates are pushing for Senate consideration, emphasizing the bill’s role in national security and economic competitiveness. If enacted, the SPEED Act could significantly reshape federal permitting, potentially accelerating projects critical to AI development and domestic manufacturing in the coming years.

The simulator will be one of only two NuScale E2 Center control room simulators on the East Coast and will position Southwest Virginia as a training and innovation hub for advanced nuclear energy and clean power workforce development.

“Virginia is leading the way in pairing innovation with opportunity, and this new NuScale small modular reactor simulator at UVA Wise is a powerful example of that vision in action,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “By investing in advanced nuclear training in Southwest Virginia, we are preparing our students and workers for the next generation of high-paying energy and technology jobs while strengthening our All-American, All-of-the-Above Energy Plan.”

The small modular reactor (SMR) control room simulator will support workforce and professional training, additional K–12 STEM programming, and community open houses to build public understanding of advanced nuclear technology and clean energy. By anchoring SMR-focused education in Southwest Virginia, the project is intended to help prepare a skilled regional workforce for future nuclear deployment and energy-intensive industries such as data centers.

“The VCEIB’s investment in this NuScale simulator at UVA Wise is a strategic step toward securing the highly skilled workforce Virginia needs for its advanced nuclear future,” said Glenn Davis, Director of the Virginia Department of Energy. “By bringing cutting-edge SMR training capabilities to Southwest Virginia, we are strengthening the region’s role in clean energy innovation.”

“The simulator supports the Commonwealth’s goals for delivering reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean power,” said Julianne Szyper, Deputy Director of the Virginia Department of Energy. “Furthermore, we are strengthening the cooperative environment for our higher education, industry leaders, and our communities, which is essential as we address the energy challenges of the future.”

UVA Wise will integrate the simulator into workforce programming, including a state-of-the-art SMR Operations and Control Simulation Lab designed to immerse students in reactor operations, safety, and emergency response scenarios. The lab will be located at the college’s Oxbow Center in the town of St. Paul and is similar to simulators at George Mason University and Virginia Commonwealth University.

The college will collaborate with George Mason, the Virginia Innovative Nuclear Hub (VINHub), and the Virginia Nuclear Energy Consortium (VNEC) to share curriculum, leverage technical expertise, and maximize statewide educational and research benefits.

“We are excited for this new opportunity to help the region’s workforce gain hands-on experience with one of the world’s leading technologies,” said Donna P. Henry, Chancellor of UVA Wise. “The NuScale simulator will enhance our outreach programs, expand STEM outreach, and help increase understanding about energy possibilities while positioning Southwest Virginia at the forefront of clean energy workforce development.”

The grant will support its purchase, installation and initial training activities. UVA Wise plans to confirm the simulator order in December with installation and training beginning in January 2026.

Through support for innovative initiatives like these, VCEIB accelerates the deployment of clean power generation and energy infrastructure across the Commonwealth with loans and other financing options.

But with higher temperatures and heat factored into the equation, folks living in Louisiana, and the South in general, tend to use more kWh each month to stay cool regardless of who provides their power. That can mean higher overall electric bills for families and businesses.

Introduction

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments in response to the administration’s Request for Information for Accelerating the American Scientific Enterprise. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

The U.S. scientific enterprise has reached a fork in the road. While previous policy has encouraged principal investigators to pursue creativity and curiosity in conducting research, it is clear that this approach has not had the desired effect on advancing American competitiveness and strengthening America’s position in maximizing national power. The science community must move beyond the linear Science, the Endless Frontier-model of scientific research, developed and encouraged by Vannevar Bush, and realign scientific exploration with national interests, especially in the face of the growing technological and economic threat posed by China.[1]

Undertaking this shift will mean prioritizing high-impact fields such as engineering, life sciences, and computer science over those with a less-direct impact on national competitiveness, and it means more closely aligning the research and academic community with private industry, prioritizing technology transfer and commercialization over basic, curiosity-driven research.

While we hope the administration will consider ITIF’s comments and recommendations on these issues, we also would like to urge the administration to consider the bipartisan policy blueprint already developed during the first Trump administration in the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) “Return on Investment Initiative for Unleashing American Innovation” (the Green Paper). The Green Paper outlined a series of readily executable policy ideas to improve America’s technology transfer ecosystem, increase the return on investment (ROI) from research dollars, streamline federal technology regulations, and increase the competitive orientation of the scientific enterprise. We believe that the Green Paper presents a set of readily accessible and easily implementable policy ideas to advance the American Scientific Enterprise. The administration should start by reviewing and implementing the strong work it’s already done in this regard.

Responses to RFI Questions

(i) What policy changes to Federal funding mechanisms, procurement processes, or partnership authorities would enable stronger public-private collaboration and allow America to tap into its vast private sector to better drive use-inspired basic and early-stage applied research?

First and foremost, the United States must recognize that it has already built the world’s most effective system for technology commercialization, especially where it pertains to intellectual property (IP)/technologies derived from federally funded research and development (R&D) conducted at U.S. universities and research institutions. While positive reforms can still be made on the margins, the Trump administration must refrain from implementing poor IP/technology commercialization policies that unnecessarily make innovation more difficult, risky, and expensive.

In September 2025, in an Axios interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for the federal government to claim half the patent earnings from university inventions derived in part from federal R&D, erroneously asserting that “the U.S. government is getting no return on the money it invests in federal research.”[2] Yet the reality is the U.S. taxpayer—and the government—benefits greatly from this R&D funding. They benefit first from the extensive innovations produced from the academic tech transfer process, which alone has produced hundreds of life-saving drugs and vaccines, including treatments for breast, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancer, not to mention other breakthroughs in everything from Honeycrisp apples and neoprene to cloud and quantum computing. Second, university IP licensing revenues help fund key innovation-enabling infrastructure at U.S. universities, such as labs, incubators, or innovation accelerators that keep the innovation flywheel churning. Third, the government benefits from the taxes produced by the trillions in industrial output and millions of jobs created as a result of university tech transfer.[3] For instance, university research parks alone generated $33 billion in federal tax revenue in 2024.[4] The administration should refrain from imposing a claim or a tax on IP licensing revenues earned by U.S. universities.

Similarly, the administration should refrain from proposals to charge patent holders between 1 and 5 percent of a patent’s overall value. As ITIF has written, taxing patents would disincentivize innovation and harm American competitiveness all while be extraordinarily difficult to implement.[5] (It’s difficult enough for the private sector to accurately value IP, let alone a government agency doing so, and especially when debatable valuations would be tied up in litigation for years.) If the United States wishes to develop more and more useful IP—which is certainly should as a matter of technology and innovation policy—then increasing the cost of that IP through an annual tax should be a proposal summarily dispatched. Indeed, the United States should proceed in the exact option direction, such as how the United States offers lower patent filing fees for small businesses and how it has worked through patent backlogs which once took years to clear.[6]

Do not apply Bayh-Dole march in rights to control the price of resulting products. As late as 1978, the federal government had licensed less than 5 percent of the as many as 30,000 patents it owned.[7] Most of them languished on the shelves of government offices or labs. Congress transformed the situation by passing the bipartisan 1980 Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, better known as the “Bayh-Dole Act.” The legislation both created a uniform patent policy among the many federal agencies funding research and allowed universities to retain ownership of the IP and inventions made as a result of federally funded research.[8] The Bayh-Dole Act has transformed U.S. universities into engines of innovation, spawning robust academic technology transfer and commercialization capabilities and activities at hundreds of universities across the United States.[9]

In fact, the impact of academic technology transfer from U.S. universities has been so extensive that, from 1996 to 2020, it resulted in 554,000 inventions disclosed, 141,000 U.S. patents granted, and 18,000 start-ups formed.[10] Moreover, academic technology transfer has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion, contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output, and supported 6.5 million jobs over that time.[11]

When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act it included so-called “march-in right” provisions, which permit the government, in specified circumstances, to require patent holders to grant a “nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license” to a “responsible applicant or applicants.”[12] Yet some have called for the government to use Bayh-Dole march-in rights to control the price of resulting products, such as pharmaceutical drugs. This despite the fact that lower prices are not one of the rationales laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, as senators Bayh and Dole have themselves noted, the Bayh-Dole Act’s march-in rights were never intended to control or ensure “reasonable prices.”[13]

The Trump administration should return to an initiative undertaken in its first iteration, when it had directed NIST to undertake a review of federal policies that could bolster the return of federal investments in R&D. The final 2018 report NIST produced, the “Return on Investment Initiative: Draft Green Paper,” concluded, “The use of march-in is typically regarded as a last resort, and has never been exercised since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.”[14] The report further noted, “NIH determined that that use of march-in to control drug prices was not within the scope and intent of the authority.”[15] The Trump administration should build upon the findings of the 2018 NIST Green Paper and affirmatively declare that price is not a legitimate basis for the exercise of Bayh-Dole march-in rights.

Do not give away American IP. The administration should also refrain from giving away private American IP to foreign or domestic entities. In the waning days of the Biden administration, the Nuclear Research Program at the Department of Energy misguidedly opened up U.S. clean energy technology to the world. The Nuclear Research Program actually mandated that any interventions supported by its funding be given away—even to foreign rivals.[16] The memo, which was not initially made public outside of the Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, stated:

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) is issuing this guidance regarding the commercialization of NE-funded technologies. With this guidance, NE is establishing a policy preference for the dedication to the public of such technology, where it is made freely available to the public with few or no intellectual property restrictions, or the non-exclusive licensing of technology developed with NE funding. (Emphasis added.)

Recognizing that the contractors who manage National Laboratories for DOE according to Management & Operating (M&O) contracts (DOE National Laboratory contractors) generally have rights under the Bayh-Dole Act, including the right to elect title to federally-funded inventions and license those inventions per the technology transfer mission clauses of M&O contracts this policy is intended to be a significant factor that the National Laboratory M&O contractors are expected to weigh when structuring and negotiating the licensing of NE-funded technologies, even when owned by the contractor. In the extraordinary circumstances in which a National Laboratory wants to exclusively license a NE funded technology, NE expects the National Laboratory M&O contractor to consult with NE leadership and the DOE Patent Counsel prior to entering into such an exclusive license. The purpose of this consultation is to verify that all parties agree that the exclusive license is the best vehicle for advancing DOE’s mission and interests, including maximizing commercialization and broadly disseminating NE-funded technology.[17]

Giving away U.S. nuclear technology is a poor strategy when China has already begun to surpass the United States in the research into and deployment of fourth-generation nuclear reactor technologies and to at least be close to, if not at par, with the United States in nuclear fusion.[18] The DOE should follow established technology licensing practices as codified in the Bayh-Dole Act.

(ii) How can the Federal government better support the translation of scientific discoveries from academia, national labs, and other research institutions into practical applications? Specifically, what changes to tech transfer policies, translational programs, or commercial incentives would accelerate the path from labs to market?

Empower the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) TIP Directorate. One of the most effective ways in which the U.S. government can catalyze technology transfer and commercialization would be by empowering a program it has already established. The National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnership (TIP) with the mission of accelerating key technology transfer to advance U.S. competitiveness. Congress authorized the directorate with $20 billion through the CHIPS and Science Act through 2027.[19] TIP makes industry buy-in a prerequisite for all projects receiving funding. Under Subtitle G of the CHIPS and Science Act, TIP grants must “develop mutually beneficial research and technology development partnerships and collaborations among entities such as institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, labor organizations, for-profit entities, government entities, and international entities,” a guideline meant to guarantee an accelerated path to practical commercialization and use, and a stark contrast from much of NSF’s other research.[20] Additionally, Subtitle G states that TIP grants are to be awarded only for research in several key technology focus areas, including AI, quantum computing, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.[21]

However, in the years since the CHIPS Act was passed, Congress has only appropriated $410 million to the program.[22] Unsurprisingly, a program with an intended budget of $20 billion can’t build U.S. competitiveness in critical technologies with just 10 percent of that budget. Yet, it has still made significant strides in accelerating technology translation. Rather than funding the ten technologies it originally chose, TIP has launched funding opportunities for three technologies viewed as having the greatest potential for growth in competitiveness with the smallest investment: AI use for protein and enzyme design, advancing cell-free systems in biochemical processes, and improving fifth-generation networks and creating next-generation wireless networks.

Given the success TIP has displayed in funding critical technology research and attracting private partners to research projects, Congress should extend the period over which the CHIPS Act authorizes TIP funding beyond 2027 to ensure that all $20 billion authorized is appropriated and appropriate $1 billion to the directorate for fiscal year 2026. Even with an additional $1 billion in appropriated funds from the CHIPS and Science Act, TIP would not be able to pursue funding opportunities across all 10 key technologies that Congress identified as critical to U.S. competitiveness. It would, at most, fund opportunities in a handful of technologies. An additional $1 billion should be added each fiscal year until annual appropriations for TIP reach or exceed $4 billion per year.

TIP is also operating with a 45 percent smaller workforce as of January 2025 as a result of departures from attrition, deferred resignation programs, early retirement offers, and other cuts made in compliance with directives from the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, compounded by the ongoing federal hiring freeze.[23] A smaller workforce, coupled with the hiring freeze, has made it impossible to expand TIP’s network of programs into critical technology areas. Congress must make it a priority to fund TIP fully and lift the hiring freeze for TIP.

Increase the importance of commercialization activities at federal labs and research institutes. America’s federal laboratories are insufficiently incentivized to invest time, energy, and resources in facilitating technology transfer, in large part because technology transfer is not even one of the eight main criteria in the Performance Evaluation and Management Plan (PEMP), a kind of annual report card for the federal labs.[24] Rather, PEMP treats successful transfers of technology to market as an afterthought. Elevating this important function to its own category would have significant impacts on the management of the labs and help to reverse the buildup of decades of skepticism and intransigence toward commercialization. Adding a ninth category to the PEMP for “Technology Impact” would create a mechanism to evaluate the economic impact of lab-developed technology, creating a stronger incentive for lab managers to focus on market implementation of valuable government IP assets and technical capabilities.[25]

Consider federal model IP agreements. Several states have implemented model intellectual property agreements, enabling faster, easier collaboration between universities and the private sector and streamlining the technology transfer process. Virginia, one of these states, announced its Lab-to-Launch initiative in August of this year, which will help university researchers and entrepreneurs in two key ways. First, the agreement standardizes the language in university IP agreements with start-ups, reducing the barriers and costs for entrepreneurs looking to commercialize their innovations. Start-ups that spin off from universities using these licenses are also eligible for awards of up to $50,000 toward their commercialization costs.[26]

Second, the bill creates an Entrepreneur-in-Residence program that connects university researchers with the private sector. This program will develop an online database of university IP, making it easier for private industry to find and engage with university researchers, reducing the cost and time required for collaboration.[27] The federal agreement should examine these model IP licensing agreements and evaluate if they could be helpful toward improving IP licensing practices, such as for IP coming out of national laboratories.

Expand DOE’s Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). LEEP is designed to help early-stage innovative energy entrepreneurs take their product ideas to market with the collaboration of laboratory staff. LEEP programs have been developed at several national laboratories, including the Cyclotron Road program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The LEEP program has enabled scientific entrepreneurs to develop critical energy-specific technologies that would have been cost-prohibitive without funding from national laboratories. One study found that LEEP achieved a 92 percent success rate, with nearly 4,000 jobs created, 182 new businesses started, and 212 fellows supported.[28]

Other government agencies should adopt the LEEP program, expanding this opportunity beyond simply clean energy technologies. The Department of War could undertake LEEP programs to support entrepreneurial scientists in defense and security technologies, or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) could develop a similar program for individuals with innovative ideas in life sciences or biotechnology.

Empower the NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) program. NSF’s Engineering Research Center program (ERC) supports a network of 17 strategic university-industry partnerships that pursue high-risk, high-payoff research across almost the entire spectrum of technology fields—including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, clean energy and sustainability, microelectronics, and information technology.[29] Since 1985, NSF has funded 83 ERCs that have led to more than 1,400 invention licenses, 920 patents, and 250 spinoff companies.[30] However, these partnerships do not require any industry funding match, reducing the likelihood that engineers trained in this program will be prepared with industry-specific skills or that research in these centers will be commercialized by private industry. Additionally, among the 17 ERCs currently funded by NSF, several are not focused on technologies used in globally traded industries, again reducing the applicability of the skills learned and the research conducted in these centers to the private sector.[31]

The administration should work to reform and expand this program. Given the goal of the ERC program to engage industry, it should be housed within the TIP directorate at NSF. Moving this program will also ensure that the ERC centers are aligned with the aforementioned 10 strategic key technology areas focused on by TIP.[32] Additionally, the framework for awarding funding under ERC should be adjusted. NSF should require that ERCs have at least half of their federal funding matched by industry. TIP should also ensure that existing and new ERCs more effectively coordinate with other similar federally funded programs. For example, NSF’s ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies should coordinate with the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing and Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), as both conduct research on cell manufacturing, but with a lower-level TRL focus for the ERC and a higher-level focus for NIIMBL. Beyond these reforms, the administration should work with Congress to ensure at least $150 million in annual funding for the NSF ERC program, supporting both existing and new manufacturing-focused ERCs.

Expand the Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRC) program. The Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program forges partnerships between universities and industry, featuring industrially relevant fundamental research, industrial support of and collaboration in research and education, and direct transfer of university-developed ideas, research results, and technology to U.S. industry to improve its competitive posture in global markets.[33] NSF currently operates IUCRCs in 10 different critical technologies, including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and information, communication, and computing.[34] As with the ERC program, the United States could get more out of the IUCRC program to support both the American scientific enterprise and U.S. industrial competitiveness. The IUCRC program should also be moved under the TIP directorate in NSF to ensure that IUCRC focus areas align with those designated by Congress as critical to U.S. competitiveness. Additionally, the Trump administration should work with Congress to provide annual funding for the IUCRC program that supports at least 15 more centers in critical commercial-ready technologies.

(iii) What policies would encourage the formation and scaling of regional innovation ecosystems that connect local businesses, universities, educational institutions, and the local workforce—particularly in areas where the Federal government has existing research assets like national laboratories or federally-funded research centers?

Expand the collaborative R&D Tax Credit. Growing sectors of the economy increasingly rely on collaborative research (e.g. research performed between a business and a university, federal lab, or consortium). Businesses are increasingly turning to universities, federal labs, and other external sources for research, allowing for the creation of top-ranked innovative commercial products. In response, U.S. allies and competitors are increasingly offering additional tax incentives to spur collaborative R&D. For example, Hungary offers a full expensing of all R&D costs conducted under collaboration with a university or research institution up to 500 million forints.[35] Japan offers a flat tax credit for collaborating with a university or research institution of up to 30 percent.[36]

Yet, the R&D tax credit—the principal way the government entices the private sector to invest more in R&D—falls short of effectively incentivizing research collaborations. To make the United States more competitive, Congress should create a collaborative R&D tax credit, eligible for all sectors. The United States currently provides a 20 percent credit for collaborative R&D, but it only applies to energy research. The administration should work with Congress to eliminate the energy restriction. Further, companies should be able to claim the R&D tax credit on 100 percent of the investments they make in R&D at U.S. universities; currently they’re only able to make a claim of up to 70 percent of their investment.

Reform Technology Hub Programs. In a 2019 report, “The Case for Growth Centers,” ITIF examined where innovation jobs are found in the U.S. economy, defining these as jobs in industries that have a specified level of R&D intensity and that employ a certain share of STEM workers. ITIF found that fully one-third of U.S. innovation jobs are concentrated in just 14 U.S. counties, and one-half in 40 counties.[37] This insight was part of the inspiration behind Congressional creation of the Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) Regional Tech Hubs program. EDA has designated 31 Tech Hubs and, in July 2024, released $504 million in Implementation awards for 12 of the 31 designated Tech Hubs.[38] The remaining 19 hubs should be fully funded.

Besides Congress not appropriating enough money, the program was poorly implemented. The Biden administration allowed NSF and the Department of Commerce (along with the Department of War and the Small Business Administration) to develop their own regional hub programs with no coordination, essentially spreading limited resources far too wide and thin. Moreover, many of the EDA awards are weak and likely to never become self-sufficient hubs once federal funding ends. Accordingly, the Trump administration should redo the competition, but this time fund fewer centers, make NSF and EDA develop a joint program, require industry investment, and ensure that winners could be self-sufficient.

(iv) How can federal policies strengthen the role played by small and medium-sized businesses as both drivers of innovation and as early adopters of emerging tech?

The Trump administration should work with Congress to get the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs reauthorized. The programs (enacted in 1982 and 1992, respectively) have grown to become the federal government’s most impactful programs and largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization, allowing U.S.-owned and operated small businesses to engage in R&D activity that has a strong potential for commercialization.[39] SBIR sets aside 3.25 percent of R&D funding from 11 federal agencies (all those with R&D budgets greater than $100 million annually), providing about $2.5 billion annually to support small businesses engaging in R&D with commercialization potential.

SBIR accounts for only 3 percent of federal extramural research funding, yet numerous studies have documented the program’s tremendous contributions to the U.S. innovation economy. Since the program’s inception, it has distributed over $40 billion in funding, which has contributed to the generation of over 70,000 patents and 700 public companies.[40] On average, SBIR-supported companies receive 10 patents each day—a testament to the innovative prowess of the more than 450,000 engineers and scientists working in companies that have been SBIR-supported.[41] Companies launched in part with SBIR support feature a “who’s who” of some of America’s most successful innovators, including 23andMe, Amgen, Apple, Biogen, Jarvik Heart, LIFT Labs, Millennium Pharma, Qualcomm, Symantec, iRobot, and countless others.[42]

Congressional policymakers failed to reauthorize the program before its expiration on September 30, 2025, leaving the future of large-scale small business and startup success in jeopardy. Congress should reauthorize the programs in new legislation while addressing some obvious issues, such as so-called SBIR mills, or companies that have become dependent on SBIR awards as a primary business model. For instance, Congress could cap the number of proposals any single small business may submit in response to any single Phase I or Phase II solicitation to no more than three proposals across the firm or limit businesses to no more than 25 proposals per year across all SBIR and STTR solicitations.[43] Congress could also cap the total award amount that a firm may receive from SBIR grants to $75 million.

Expand the use of innovation vouchers. The administration should consider working with Congress to expand the availability of innovation vouchers for small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Innovation vouchers are grants that enable SMEs to purchase services from universities, research institutions, or federal labs to stimulate innovation. These services may include assistance with conducting R&D, technology feasibility assessments, overcoming specific product development hurdles, product prototyping, lab validation, or other activities that are difficult for smaller businesses to undertake. Many innovation voucher programs have been adopted at the state level in the United States, including in Connecticut, New York, and New Mexico, as well as internationally in many European nations and Canada. In the United States, vouchers range from $25,000 to $50,000, while in Europe they range from €10,000 to €25,000.[44]

Innovation vouchers foster greater levels of the industry-academic collaboration necessary for knowledge transfer, while introducing SMEs to continuous R&D and innovation practices. As firms become more comfortable conducting R&D, the time required for product commercialization is reduced, inducing greater economic benefits.[45]

For the past several years, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have provided technical assistance to the recipients of Department of Energy (DOE) -funded voucher programs, namely American-Made Challenges (AMC), the Incubator Program, and the Small Business Vouchers Program. This effort should be fully built out into a national program across the clean energy focused federal labs to drive strong relationships between entrepreneurs and the national labs to accelerate the roll-out of new technologies in U.S. clean energy sectors such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries and solar cells.[46]

Expand the availability of Manufacturing Reinvestment Account. In Connecticut, small manufacturers receive a manufacturing reinvestment account, similar to a 401(k), where they may invest up to $100,000 of profits annually over five years. These accounts are 100 percent tax-exempt and may only be used for R&D-related expenses. Implementing these accounts on the federal level would allow small manufacturers to more easily afford R&D activities, with minimal cost to the government.[47]

(v) What empirically grounded findings from metascience research and progress studies could inform the federal grantmaking process to maximize ROI? Please provide specific examples of evidence-based reforms that could improve funding allocation, peer review, or grant evaluation.

A growing body of metascience studies can inform two key points of the federal grantmaking system: what and how it funds.

1. What the federal government funds:

(a) Longer, flexible, investigator-focused grants increase breakthrough output

Empirical evidence:

Azoulay et al. (2011) compare Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator awards—long-term, flexible grants that tolerate early failure—to NIH R01 awards, which are shorter, milestone-driven, and more risk averse. The study finds that HHMI investigators produce high-impact articles at significantly higher rates than comparable NIH-funded scientists.[48]

Potential reform:

Dedicate a defined share of NIH/NSF extramural budgets (e.g., 10-20 percent) to investigator-focused awards that offer longer terms, flexible budgets, and broader mission statements rather than narrow specific aims. This operationalizes the principle of funding people, not just projects, which empirical evidence suggests yields more transformative science.

2. How the federal government decides what to fund: Improving peer review

(a) Funding more highly novel projects

Empirical evidence:

A metascience review of existing studies found that standard peer review is biased against highly novel or interdisciplinary proposals, which are routinely penalized by reviewers, as reviewers discount ideas that are too unfamiliar or interdisciplinary (See: Tartari and Kolympiris, 2021; Ayoubi et al., 2021; Boudreau et al., 2016; Lane et al., 2021).[49]

Potential reform:

Create dedicated high-novelty tracks at NIH/NSF with panels explicitly instructed to reward novelty and be more tolerant of failure, evaluation frameworks that expect a mix of failures and successes, and a committed budget share for high-risk, high-reward proposals.

(b) Partial randomization to increase fairness when reviewer scores converge

Empirical evidence:

Research shows that in the mid-range, where many proposals are essentially indistinguishable in quality, reviewers are faced with the difficult task of selecting among these, which increases the risk of arbitrary decisions not based on scientific criteria that opens the door to biases. Partial randomization (lotteries) in this zone of proposals, complementing peer review, could provide an unbiased measure of fairness without harming scientific quality.[50]

Potential reform:

Implement tiered review in large NIH/NSF programs:

▪ Tier 1: Clearly outstanding, top rated, proposals—fund normally.

▪ Tier 2: All proposals above a quality threshold but not clearly rankable—enter into a lottery.

▪ Tier 3: Clearly noncompetitive—do not fund.

Start with pilots (e.g., small programs) and rigorously evaluate outcomes relative to traditional peer-reviewed programs.

(vi) What reforms will enable the American scientific enterprise to pursue more high-risk, high-reward research that could transform our scientific understanding and unlock new tech, while sustaining the incremental science essential for cumulative production of knowledge?

Create megafunds for high risk R&D. In 1960, private-sector R&D was split one-third to research and two-thirds to development. Today, only one-fifth of firm R&D goes to research. One reason companies are moving away from basic and applied research is because of the risk involved in financing. In drug development, for example, it often takes years or decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to produce a profitable product. Individual companies and even venture capitalists often lack the appetite for such long-term, high-risk, high-reward investments.

This risk could be mitigated through large portfolios that aggregate and manage risk. Mutual funds, pension funds, and 401(k) retirement accounts work this way, and MIT economist Andrew Lo has proposed extending this idea by establishing “megafunds” that utilize financial engineering techniques to fund R&D in long-term, high-risk, high-payoff areas such as drug discovery for cancer or orphan diseases.[51] However, to date, no such megafunds have been created by the market. The government incentives required for the creation of these funds could include one or more approaches from four broad categories: research and investment data streams; clear rules for private foundation program-related megafund investments; federal credit support; and tax incentives for funds investing in technologies with high societal impact (for example through the establishment of schedules and values of basis point step-ups and penalties).

To promote the creation of R&D megafunds, the Trump administration should establish an office within the Department of Commerce to develop and implement the needed incentives and oversight. The office would be tasked with establishing the rules for the funds and coordinating with federal agencies and the private sector to identify the technical areas of national interest where private-sector engagement is needed and the incentives required. The office should work with researchers, industry, and regulators to develop data-reporting and transparency standards that promote the translation of research to the market, provide a better understanding of the societal benefits of research, and an efficient data stream for regulation, and coordinate with federal funding agencies to enforce the provision and collection of such data.[52]

Continue to support the existing HRHR programs across government. Several government agencies have programs designed to fund HRHR research, which often have high costs but can yield high ROI. The NIH Common Fund includes an HRHR portfolio designed to invest solely in these more expensive investments, and the several ARPA offices in the DOE, Department of War, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Transportation have a similar purpose. The administration should refrain from cutting these programs as a short-term cost-saving measure and instead focus on the long-term returns they provide. The Trump administration should continue to empower these agencies to fund HRHR research.

(vii) How can the federal government support novel institutional models for research that complement traditional university structures and enable projects that require vast resources, interdisciplinary coordination, or an extended timeline?

The Financial Accountability in Research Model (FAIR). Under the current federal research funding mechanism for research institutions, institutions are paid for their research costs under two different categories: direct research costs, which include the cost of project materials, researchers, and payments to research participants, and indirect research costs, including the costs of utilities, leases, operations, and other facility expenses supporting research activities. Indirect costs are paid to the institution at a negotiated reimbursement rate that has not been adjusted in recent years and therefore does not account for the increase in regulatory and administrative costs for researchers. Thus, researchers are often reimbursed far below the true value of indirect research costs, placing an extra financial burden on research institutions.[53]

The Financial Accountability in Research (FAIR) Model improves on the current system by requiring all research institutions to classify all costs for each project they undertake as research performance costs (formerly direct costs) and essential research performance support and general research operations (formerly indirect costs). These changes increase the transparency for the government by outlining exactly what services are being funded, and ensures that research institutions are funded for their complete research costs, rather than just a small fraction. The administration should work with Congress to implement the FAIR Model for all agencies that award grant funding.[54]

Focused Research Organizations (FROs). Traditional academic structures excel at investigator-driven discovery but struggle with projects that require large-scale coordination, extended timelines, or shared research infrastructure. Novel institutional models could fill this gap. The federal government can support Focused Research Organizations (FROs)—non-profit entities designed to tackle large, complex research challenges and produce public goods (tools, datasets, platforms) and fall outside the scope of a single academic lab, company, or informal consortium.[55]

Historical examples include the Large Hadron Collider and the Human Genome Project—efforts too large and too uncertain for individual labs or early-stage companies, not immediately lucrative enough for industry to undertake, yet essential for scientific progress.[56]

In biopharma, FROs could tackle pre-competitive challenges too big for one company. One current example, supported by Convergent Research, an incubator for FROs, aims to map the pharmome—identifying all unintended targets of approved small-molecule drugs.[57] The public benefits include better safety pharmacology profiling, new drug repurposing opportunities, and better training data for AI drug development models.

NSF’s initiative, Tech Labs, announced December 12, 2025 to launch and scale a new generation of transformative independent research organizations to advance breakthrough science is an important step in this direction.[58] Most federal science funding takes the form of small, project-based grants to individual scientists at universities, but a more diversified funding portfolio, with initiatives such as Tech Labs (with $10-50 million/year awards per team, 5+ year commitments, and measuring impact through advancement up the Tech Readiness Level scale rather than papers published) is key as research today is increasingly team-based, interdisciplinary, and infrastructure-intensive, needing institutional support, and cannot be done only through the traditional funding model of a series of grant projects.

(viii) How can the Federal government leverage and prepare for advances in AI systems that may transform scientific research—including automated hypothesis generation, experimental design, literature synthesis, and autonomous experimentation? What infrastructure investments, organizational models, and workforce development strategies are needed to realize these capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor and research integrity?

One of the most effective ways the federal government can prepare for AI-driven advances in scientific research is by ensuring that emerging automation capabilities are translated into widely usable research infrastructure. A key priority should be supporting the adoption of self-driving labs (SDLs), which use AI and robotics to autonomously design, execute, and interpret experiments. SDLs directly increase scientific productivity by replacing slow, manual trial-and-error workflows with automated experimental loops. This is especially important in materials science, where progress remains rate-limited by the need to fabricate and test large numbers of physical samples because material behavior cannot be reliably predicted in advance. By automating experimentation and continuously feeding results back into models, SDLs allow researchers to explore larger design spaces more quickly while generating standardized, reproducible data.

While promising SDL systems already exist, ensuring their broad adoption as routine research infrastructure will require sustained public support. Materials science, in particular, has seen slower diffusion than related fields such as chemistry, where automated synthesis and high-throughput experimentation are more established. This reflects the long timelines from discovery to deployment in materials, which reduce private incentives to invest in capital-intensive automation despite large long-term returns. Targeted public funding can ensure these capabilities scale.

Policymakers should ensure broad adoption by pursuing public funding models that de-risk early deployment and make self-driving labs accessible beyond a small number of well-resourced institutions. One approach is an ARPA-E–style Grand Challenge that competitively funds teams to build and demonstrate SDLs capable of delivering measurable advances in materials discovery. This would accelerate technical progress while establishing proof points for SDLs as durable national infrastructure. In parallel, policymakers should support Focused Research Organizations to develop modular, open-source hardware and software components that lower costs, enable interoperability, and make SDLs easier to replicate and adapt across labs. Together, these models would move SDLs from isolated demonstrations into widely usable research infrastructure.

(ix) What specific federal statutes, regulations, or policies create unnecessary barriers to scientific research or the deployment of research outcomes? Please describe the barrier, its impact on scientific progress, and potential remedies that would preserve legitimate policy objectives while enabling innovation?

Develop a Phase Zero grant award program within major federal research agencies. When the SBIR and STTR programs were still active, they both supported innovation, but required high approval standards for early-stage companies. There was often insufficient funding available at universities (or from other sources) to advance nascent technologies to the point at which these companies were positioned to receive an SBIR or STTR grant. The problem was that researchers and universities lacked the resources to support the proof-of-concept work, market analysis, and mentoring needed to translate ideas and nascent technologies from the university laboratory into a commercial product.

A national “Phase Zero” proof-of-concept program would not only help more projects cross the “valley of death,” but would also help enhance the infrastructure (e.g., expertise, personnel, support, small business, and venture capital engagement) and facilitate the cultural change necessary for universities, federal laboratories, and other non-profit research organizations to support commercialization activities.

America’s competitors have recognized the need for such an instrument. For instance, the European Research Council (ERC) has announced a new proof-of-concept funding initiative to help bridge the gap between ERC-funded research and the earliest stage of marketable innovations.[59] These awards can be as high as $215,000 for individual researchers, in total, equivalent to about 1 percent of ERC’s budget.[60] Here in the United States, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation has established Translational Research (for individual researchers) and Translational Partnership (for institutions) Awards for proof-of-concept research in biomedical engineering.[61] The Translational Research Awards are made in amounts of approximately $100,000 per year, while the university grants have a duration of five years at over $500,000 per year.

Similarly, NIH’s Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) program fosters the development of therapeutics, preventatives, diagnostics, devices, and tools that address diseases within NIH’s mission in a manner consistent with business case development. The work supported by the REACH program may include technical validation, market research, clarification of IP position and strategy, and investigation of commercial or business opportunities.[62] Finally, a number of states, such as Kentucky and Louisiana, have developed Phase Zero grants to help firms apply for SBIR grants and support early proof-of-concept research. One way for the federal government to implement such a proof-of-concept program would be through a grant program for states that agree to match the funds dollar-for-dollar.

(x) How can Federal programs better identify and develop scientific talent across the country, particularly leveraging digital tools and distributed research models to engage researchers outside traditional academic centers?

If the United States is to significantly revitalize America’s scientific enterprise, it needs to take further steps to ensure it has the workforce to support expanded U.S. scientific and technical output. That’s especially the case as analysts expect the demand for tech talent to grow to 7.1 million tech jobs by 2034 in the United States, from an estimated six million in 2023.[63] Another report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) finds that, by the end of 2030, an estimated 3.85 million additional jobs requiring proficiency in technical fields will be created in the United States, but that, “Of those, 1.4 million jobs risk going unfilled unless we can expand the pipeline for such workers in fields such as skilled technicians, engineering, and computer science.”[64] For the semiconductor industry, the report estimates that roughly 67,000—or 58 percent of projected new jobs (and 80 percent of projected new technical jobs)—risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates.[65] The administration should lead in several efforts to enhance U.S. workforce skilling, including:

Expand Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program funding. Skilled technicians are a key component of the traded sector workforce. One highly successful program designed to build technician skills is NSF’s Advanced Technological Education program, which supports community colleges working in partnership with industry, economic development agencies, workforce investment boards, and secondary and other higher education institutions.[66] ATE projects and centers are educating technicians in a range of fields, including nanotechnologies and microtechnologies, rapid prototyping, biomanufacturing, logistics, and alternative fuel automobiles. Notwithstanding this, ATE funding is quite small, at approximately $74 million in FY 2025.[67] The Trump administration should work with Congress to double ATE funding to at least $150 million per year.

Expand the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP). The engineering curricula at too many American universities is overly academic as opposed to industry focused. Indeed, university engineering programs have evolved in two troubling directions over the past several decades. First, the focus on “engineering as a science” has increasingly moved university engineering education away from a focus on real problem solving toward more abstract engineering science. Second, this focus on “engineering as a science” has left university engineering departments more concerned with producing pure knowledge than working with industry to help them solve real problems.

That’s why ITIF has argued that the United States needs more “manufacturing universities,” which would revamp their engineering programs and focus much more on manufacturing engineering and in particular work that is more relevant to industry. This would include more joint industry-university research projects, more student training that incorporates manufacturing experiences through co-ops or other programs, and a Ph.D. education program focused on turning out more engineering graduates who work in industry. These universities would view Ph.D.s as akin to high-level apprenticeships (as they often are in Germany), where industry experience is required as part of the degree. Likewise, criteria for faculty tenure would consider professors’ work with and/or in industry as much as their number of scholarly publications. In addition, these universities’ business schools would integrate closely with engineering and focus on manufacturing issues, including management of production.

One model for these manufacturing universities is the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, which reimagined engineering education and curriculum to prepare students “to become exemplary engineering innovators who recognize needs, design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world.”[68]

Congress implemented a form of these proposals when it passed the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program into law in December 2016 as part of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing the Department of Defense to support industry-relevant, manufacturing-focused, engineering training at U.S. institutions of higher education, universities, industry, and not-for-profit institutions. With its $48 million in initial funding, MEEP made awards to 13 educational and industry partners to bring educational opportunities to Americans interested in learning manufacturing skills critical to sustaining the U.S. defense innovation base.[69] In 2023, MEEP issued additional three-year funding grants “that establish programs or enhance existing programs to better position the manufacturing workforce to produce military systems and components that assure technological superiority for DoD.”[70]

MEEP can be a powerful initiative, but it is underfunded and has become too solely focused on engineering in the national defense context. Therefore, the Administration should work with Congress to broaden the MEEP remit to refocus it more on supporting industry-relevant, applied engineering programs at leading universities. Congress should allocate $150 million annually to a revitalized MEEP program that would make grants to 20 engineering programs at leading U.S. universities to redirect them toward more hands-on, industrially relevant engineering activities.

(xi) How can the fed government foster closer collaboration among scientists, engineers, and skilled technical workers, and better integrate training pathways, recognizing that breakthrough research often requires deep collaboration between theoretical and applied expertise?

Establish an Office of Innovation Review. Because federal agencies often propose regulations with little consideration given to their effect on innovation, Congress should task the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs with creating an Office of Innovation Review (OIR) to review proposed regulations to determine their effect not just on costs in the short term but also on innovation over the long term. OIR would have the specific mission of being the “innovation champion” within agency rule-making processes.[71] It would have authority to push agencies to either affirmatively promote innovation or to achieve a particular regulatory objective in a manner least damaging to innovation. OIR would be authorized to propose new agency actions and to respond to existing ones and could incorporate a “competitiveness screen” in its review of federal regulations that affect globally traded industries.[72]

(xii) What policy mechanisms would ensure that the benefits of federally-funded research, including access to resulting tech, economic opportunities, and improved quality of life, reach all Americans?

Withdraw the NIH Intramural Research Program Access Planning Policy. On January 10, 2025, in one of the Biden administration’s final actions, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued an Intramural Research Program (IRP) Access Planning Policy whose objective was to “expand equitable patient access to products that emerge from NIH-owned patents.”[73] The directive required “organizations applying to NIH for certain commercial patent licenses to submit Access Plans to NIH outlining steps they intend to take to promote patient access to those licensed products.”[74] Pricing was a central focus of the Access Planning Policy, the guidance noting that ways applicants could “promote equitable access and affordability in product deployment” could include by “Committing to keep prices in the U.S. equal to those in other developed countries” or by “Committing to price reductions once preset sales, revenue, or profit thresholds are reached.”[75]

But bringing a drug to market represents a complex, risky, lengthy, and costly process that can take 14 or more years at costs measured in the billions of dollars. The notion that a small start-up licensing prospective IP in the form of a novel chemical compound from a university is in any kind of position to reliably price a potentially resulting product over a decade and hundreds of millions, if not billions, in further development and clinical trials costs is simply not realistic. (And the same goes for many products beyond drugs.) Requiring licensees to accurately predict years in advance how a product resulting from a licensed IP would be priced would stifle U.S. biopharmaceutical innovation. Therefore, the Trump administration should direct the NIH to withdraw its Intramural Research Program Access Planning Policy and also ensure that similar requirements aren’t promulgated across other federal agencies.[76]

The advancement of transformative scientific breakthroughs requires more than robust R&D funding—it also depends on a comprehensive policy framework that supports both innovation and timely deployment.

Innovative U.S. companies have pioneered the breakthrough technology of multi-cancer early detection (MCED), developing diagnostic tests that can reliably screen for the presence of more than 50 types of cancer from a simple blood draw. MCED is poised to transform the world’s cancer screening paradigm—which is vitally important when one in two women, and one in three men, are likely to develop cancer at some point in their lifetimes.[77] Unfortunately, the United States has lagged in crafting a policy environment supporting MCED adoption and encouraging innovation.

Current Medicare statutes create the most significant barrier to deployment of breakthrough medical technologies by requiring explicit congressional authorization for each new category of preventive screening, regardless of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval status. For MCED technologies this statutory gap prevents Medicare beneficiaries from accessing FDA-approved tests despite their transformative potential. The barrier’s impact extends beyond patient access: it weakens incentives for continued private-sector investment in high-risk medical research and risks ceding American leadership in precision medicine to foreign competitors, namely China.[78]

The United States simply can’t afford to squander its lead in MCED by allowing regulatory roadblocks to remain in the way of the industry’s further development. The bipartisan Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act (H.R. 842/S.339) offers a practical remedy by establishing an evidence-based pathway for coverage of FDA-approved breakthrough technologies while preserving CMS’s authority to determine appropriate coverage parameters. These reforms are consistent with the approach taken by Congress with colonoscopy screening—which ultimately paved the way for tremendous progress America has achieved in the screening of colon cancers. Importantly they would maintain rigorous safety and efficacy standards while eliminating arbitrary delays that currently separate regulatory approval from patient access, thereby strengthening the entire innovation ecosystem from basic research through clinical deployment.

(xiii) How can the federal gov strengthen research security to protect sensitive technologies and dual-use research while minimizing compliance burdens on researchers?

Create tiered risk categorizations for technologies. In practice, the current system for research security often relies on broad, compliance-heavy requirements that are not consistently tiered to the actual sensitivity of the research or the threat environment. The federal government does not use a single, unified definition of “sensitive technology” or “dual-use”; instead, it operationalizes sensitivity through multiple, partially overlapping regimes. The current model defines these categories primarily through export-control lists (the Export Administration Regulation’s Commerce Control List and the International Traffic in Arms’s U.S. Munitions List) and a few domain-specific oversight regimes (e.g., the U.S. Government Policy for Oversight of Dual-use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential in the life sciences). However, these mechanisms are anchored mainly to known items, agents, or reasonably foreseeable misuse pathways, rather than systematically tiering basic research areas by how they might become dual-use over time; this can leave emerging risks underappreciated, and some disciplines may not view themselves as part of the research/security problem set.

The centralization of risks through tiered categorization is needed precisely because of the political economy in scientific communities and research organizations/universities. There is little incentive to self-assess that basic research, far away from practical dual-use applications, can build rival countries’ capacities. Yet, this happens in practice. For example, basic research on how bacteria defend themselves from viruses helped enable CRISPR gene editing, which is now widely treated as biosecurity-relevant because it can lower barriers to modifying organisms, including potentially harmful ones; likewise, open computer-vision and machine-learning research has been incorporated into military intelligence/surveillance and targeting support.

Develop security assessment guidelines. Research scrutiny is heavily focused on projects that receive federal funding, but most R&D is driven by private investment. Although screening and organizational risk assessments for defense contractors generally work as intended, they tend to overlook private R&D in areas with capabilities that could be used for dual purposes but are currently business-oriented. For example, robotics for household use or software-heavy R&D.

A simple solution to this problem would be to introduce security assessment guidelines for companies applying for the widely used R&D tax incentive. In other words, to qualify for tax benefits for private R&D, applicants should meet a basic set of security standards, such as those established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Homeland Security.

Assemble the interagency research security working group. The interagency research security working group was established under the National Science and Technology Council and authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 to enforce the continued implementation of NSPM-33, which instituted requirements for disclosure and research security infrastructure for research recipients. OSTP should regularly convene the interagency research security working group to ensure that NSPM-33 continues to be implemented across all government agencies and that security measures are coordinated and harmonized across government.

Another potentially effective research security model would borrow from cybersecurity concepts to shift away from today’s largely binary, front-loaded approach to vetting researchers and move toward a more robust endpoint security and zero-trust architecture model. Currently, universities assess research security risk most heavily at the hiring stage, which requires high amounts of compliance and often results in a go/no-go decision that either blocks talent entirely or assumes low risks thereafter.

A zero-trust–inspired framework could instead allow broader participation while segmenting access based on risk and sensitivity, asking explicitly what data, tools, or research outputs a university is comfortable exposing if compromised. This means continuous checks throughout the research lifecycle, including in the laboratory, collaborations, access, and offboarding, rather than concentrating compliance on individual disclosures. Such an approach would reduce friction for researchers and might increase overall compliance resources, but would better shift that responsibility to universities without choking off openness or talent.

Conclusion

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation commends the Trump administration for working to reform and accelerate the American scientific enterprise. The success of this effort will be vital to enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. science and technology over the coming decade.

Economic fragmentation is driving countries to prioritize national security and resilience. Heavy industries, such as manufacturing and data centers, require dispatchable, reliable energy sources that operate 24/7. These demands are reshaping energy both domestically and abroad.

The U.S. is uniquely positioned to adapt to these changes. Its geographical advantages, including resource-rich neighbors like Canada and access to low-cost labor in the south, create a strong North American economic bloc. Combined with abundant natural resources, such as a vast supply of natural gas, the U.S. has the foundation for reindustrialization and energy independence.

In contrast, Europe faces several significant energy vulnerabilities. The continent’s lack of natural resources and reliance on imports make it susceptible to energy shocks. While renewables advance environmental goals, they cannot meet the demands of heavy industries, accelerating Europe’s deindustrialization.

Meanwhile, China pursues an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy, investing in coal, nuclear, and renewables, while forging ties with resource-rich nations. However, inefficiencies in its state-controlled system, coupled with politically motivated policies, and the health of its domestic economy without a US consumption partner to trade with raise concerns about the long-term sustainability and efficiency of its energy approach.

America’s market-driven energy system offers a structural advantage over state-controlled models. Efficient resource allocation and abundant natural gas provide a reliable bridge fuel for heavy industry. At the same time, strong infrastructure supports growth despite fiscal challenges, and the U.S. is better equipped to handle the energy demands of heavy industry. To maintain this edge, U.S. policy must focus on reliability and affordability. The demand for dense, reliable energy transcends political divides. To drive reindustrialization, the U.S. must prioritize natural gas and nuclear energy as central components of its energy strategy. While renewables like solar and wind can play a complementary role, they cannot replace firm baseload power required for heavy industry. Reviving nuclear is critical to deliver 24/7, high-capacity energy.

As the world shifts to a multipolar economic system, technologies like AI are unlocking vast opportunities. By securing reliable energy, strengthening supply chains, and committing to long-term investments, the U.S. can solidify its global leadership. Businesses and investors who grasp these dynamics may be well-positioned to thrive in this new era of global competition.",https://www.williamblair.com/-/media/williamblairwebsite/feature/insights/2025/eqr_close-up-earth-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:40.939026

“On an annual basis, our solar array has produced more electricity than we have consumed”, said Nicole Barna. “This energy surplus has come back to us in the form of rebates, ensuring a win/win for our wallet and the environment.”

To help more Americans reduce energy waste and switch to renewables, the report offers resources, including guides for home winterization and how to go solar, and tips for buying a used EV.

“Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters are already using clean energy in their lives in some way,” Pappas said. “Common-sense steps can make it easier and more affordable for Americans to adopt clean energy.”

One way Massachusetts can help more residents adopt renewable energy is to encourage or require local jurisdictions to use “smart permitting” online platforms for residential solar and energy storage systems. These platforms, used in many states across the country, make it faster, easier and cheaper for residents who want to put solar on their roofs, or batteries in their garage or basement, to do so.

“This report shows that millions of Americans are moving forward to reduce the impact of their energy use on the environment”, said Massachusetts State Representative Steven Owens. “It’s so important that we keep up this momentum.”",https://environmentamerica.org/massachusetts/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_MAE.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 23:59:10.833152

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2025/12/69447067dc81c6.26060837.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:22.131440

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th judicial district against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

The goal is to fund programs that will find and remove lead service lines that deliver drinking water to communities.

As part of its process, the EPA collected updated lead service line data and released a new dashboard that shows the latest data on lead service lines in the United States. The data for this dashboard comes from the EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR), which required, among other things, that public water systems provide a service line inventory to their primary state agency by October 16, 2024.

The LCRR submissions required that service lines be categorized as follows: lead service lines or pipes made from lead; galvanized pipes requiring replacement or pipes made from galvanized steel; non-lead service lines, and water service lines made with unknown materials. Note: Galvanized pipes requiring replacement under the guidelines were treated as lead service lines, as lead can adhere to galvanized steel lines.

The EPA further estimates that there are four million total lead service lines in the United States. This figure comes from the updated 2025 7th Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment (DWINSA) and includes both active known lead service lines and anticipated lead service lines. Accordingly, funding will be based on the latest information about these approximately four million lead service lines.

An additional $1.1 billion from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) will also be allocated to this lead service line replacement initiative. These funds can be used for “lead service line replacement (LSLR) and associated activities like identification, planning, design, and replacement.”

According to Reuters, Ford Motor is taking a $19.5 billion write-down and is removing several electric-vehicle (EV) models from its line-up, as the auto industry retreats from battery-powered models in response to weakened EV demand and the Trump administration’s policies. GM and Stellantis have already shifted more of their production to combustion engine vehicles, also taking financial hits. GM wrote down $1.6 billion in EV assets and indicated that more write-downs are expected. Due to the push for electric vehicles by Western governments, automakers overestimated their demand and are now making a detour to correct the costly error.

Sales of new electric vehicles in the United States, especially more expensive models, have slowed since the beginning of 2024. The Trump administration rolled back financial incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by removing tax credits at the end of the fiscal year, further depressing sales. The administration is also modifying automobile efficiency standards from those approved by the Biden administration to eliminate the requirement forcing EV purchases.

Companies Will Continue with EV Production at a Reduced Level

According to Reuters, Ford will switch production at a new factory in Tennessee to gas-powered pickup truck models from electric models, cancel an electric commercial van model, remake the F-150 Lightning vehicle into a hybrid from a pure electric vehicle; and convert its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and data centers that train artificial intelligence. It is also planning to build a medium electric truck with a $30,000 price target by 2027 to be competitive with Chinese automakers. That was the first in a line of low-cost electric vehicles. CBS News reports that, by 2030, Ford expects about half its global volume to consist of hybrids, extended-range vehicles, and electric vehicles, up from 17% this year. Hybrids are believed to be more affordable and practical to consumers who are wary of pure electric vehicles due to their high sticker prices, worries over battery range, and access to charging stations.

Western vehicle makers are aware of the competitive threat posed by Chinese EV automakers, whose models are popular at home and abroad. U.S. automakers see Americans want smaller, affordable EV models like those made by Chinese automakers and sold outside the United States. Currently, Chinese vehicles are banned from U.S. markets because of tariffs. Ford’s changes are expected to put it on a better footing to compete with Chinese automakers.

Besides the $19.5 billion write-down Ford is taking, its EV losses since 2023 have totaled $13 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, making its total EV junket at least a $32.5 billion mistake. American automobile buyers were charged more for their gas and diesel vehicle purchases to help pay for the misguidance of automakers producing electric vehicles, with overall vehicle prices hitting new heights. Many Americans felt vehicles were becoming unaffordable.

Via Electrek, GM is halting production of its electric vehicles due to slower EV industry growth and customer demand. Production of the Cadillac Lyriq and larger Vistiq, both of which are built at a Spring Hill, Tennessee facility, will be reduced during the first five months of 2026. GM plans to suspend one of its two shifts at the facility, resulting in layoffs for workers on the second shift. GM is also delaying the start of a second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant outside of Kansas City “indefinitely,” where the new Chevy Bolt EV was scheduled to enter production this year. GM also plans to slow production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit.

Automakers Turn to Producing Energy Storage Batteries

According to the Wall Street Journal, automakers and battery manufacturers are repurposing electric-vehicle battery plants to serve the fast-growing data-center and utility markets, as slowing EV demand pushes companies to seek alternative revenue streams. General Motors, South Korean conglomerate LG, and Chrysler parent Stellantis have shifted toward producing batteries for energy-storage systems to help offset the downturn in electric-vehicle sales.

Tesla has already built a sizable business in the segment, generating billions of dollars in sales from energy-storage batteries. Revenue from its energy-generation and storage division, which also includes solar panels, rose 67% last year to $4 billion, partially cushioning a $6 billion decline in EV revenue.

GM is also exploring a partnership to supply energy-storage batteries to Redwood Materials, a battery-recycling startup. Under the proposed arrangement, GM would provide Redwood with a mix of new and used batteries for large-scale storage projects. Meanwhile, a Chinese-owned battery manufacturer that had planned to supply Mercedes-Benz is now considering pivoting to energy-storage products in an effort to revive a stalled factory project in Kentucky.

U.S. electricity demand is growing again due to demand from artificial intelligence data centers, manufacturing, and increased electrification, which was pushed by the Biden administration and continues to be pushed in blue states. These factors make energy storage a growing business.

Europe Waters Down Its Ban on New Gas-Powered Vehicles

As reported by the BBC, the European Union has watered down its ban on new gas-powered vehicles, easing rules approved two years ago that required all new vehicles sold from 2035 onward to have zero carbon emissions, which would have effectively barred the sale of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional internal combustion engines. Instead, it is using a strict emissions cap that leaves room for gas and hybrid models. Instead of a 100% tailpipe carbon dioxide reduction target in 2035, it has a 90% fleet reduction. The change still forces automakers to sell mostly zero-emission vehicles, but it opens a path for a small number of plug-in hybrids and highly efficient combustion cars, particularly those that can run on certified carbon dioxide-neutral e-fuels or advanced biofuels.

Analysis

The so-called EV revolution is beginning to stall as automakers repurpose their EV production capacity in favor of gas-powered vehicles and batteries for energy storage. Slowing EV sales and the removal of subsidies and mandates by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have signaled to these manufacturers that their efforts are better served by meeting consumer demand rather than government incentives. Even in Europe, politicians are starting to realize that forcing automakers to sell only EVs would raise prices and force consumers to drive cars that can’t travel as far.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bigstock-Vilnius-Lithuania-July-459514845.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:02:10.624909

These wins didn’t happen on their own. They happened where governors, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental organizations and community partners fought for cleaner air and lower bills – and where utilities were held accountable for delivering modern, reliable, cost-effective solutions. Here are some of Environmental Defense Fund and our partners’ most meaningful victories from the past year:

A Year of Big Wins for Clean, Affordable Power in the States Share on X

Illinois curbed rate hikes and expanded access to clean, affordable electricity

Illinois regulators cut gas utilities’ proposed rate increases in half, trimmed the utilities’ profit rates, and rejected renewable natural gas proposals that would have raised costs without providing environmental value. EDF and Illinois PIRG were involved for months, urging regulators to require cleaner, cheaper alternatives – and the decision sends a clear message that utilities must modernize and offer cleaner, more affordable alternatives rather than double down on yesterday’s gas infrastructure.

Illinois regulators also unlocked more than $250 million for an electrified clean energy future: EV charging, fleet electrification, small business support and customer benefits. When the Illinois Attorney General challenged the Commission’s authority to approve these programs, EDF and partners intervened and won on all contested issues, protecting this progress.

EDF secured a landmark agreement with a utility to add new and expanded transmission lines – one of the most powerful tools for keeping electricity clean and affordable ­– and deploy grid-enhancing technologies to boost the performance of existing lines. These advanced hardware and software tools can cut the time and cost of connecting renewable energy to the grid. The agreement is expected to create up to 32,000 jobs, support power for 1.8 million homes, and deliver long-term savings for customers across the Midwest and beyond.

In Illinois, a new electricity rate called Rate BEST helps Commonwealth Edison customers save money using more renewable energy by shifting electricity use to times of day when power tends to be more affordable and cleaner. Since 2015, EDF and the Citizens Utility Board have championed time-of-use rates in Illinois, working with ComEd to design, pilot, and bring Rate BEST to customers in the new year.

New York advanced heat pump affordability and modern grid planning

EDF and partners secured an agreement with Con Edison to expand access to simpler, fairer electric rates designed for heat pumps – helping households cut heating bills and realize the full benefits of clean, efficient heating. These types of rates can save an average customer around $500 per year in energy costs. The utility will also expand outreach and education programs to help customers understand their options.

At the same time, the New York Public Service Commission advanced 29 critical electric grid upgrades to support electric vehicle (EV) charging and building electrification, then adopted a proactive planning framework that speeds interconnection of new loads while cutting costs. EDF’s recommendations helped drive these reforms.

Texas advanced EV charging and smarter grid planning

Texas also saw meaningful progress in 2025. EDF secured commitments from the utility CenterPoint to improve EV forecasting and modernize distribution system planning – essential steps for cost-effective electrification in one of the country’s fastest-growing EV markets. CenterPoint also committed to bolster its efforts to support the Port of Houston’s ongoing electrification, a move that will cut pollution and improve public health in surrounding communities.

Massachusetts helped customers reduce energy bills with clean heat

Massachusetts utilities – Unitil, National Grid, and Eversource – cut winter electricity rates for homes using heat pumps, saving these households about $540 on average this winter, a 17% reduction in heating bills. Adopted by the Department of Public Utilities, the rates fix long-standing inequities in how heat pump customers are charged. EDF intervened in National Grid’s rate case to secure the heat pump rate for all heat pump homes and a tiered discount rate of 32-71% for income qualifying households regardless of whether their home has a heat pump.

Looking ahead to 2026, EDF and partners are pushing for deeper seasonal delivery-charge discounts to better align winter electric heating costs with natural gas. New analysis commissioned by EDF shows that fairer rate design could enable more than 80% of Massachusetts homes to save an average of $687 in a single season – unlocking even greater benefits from clean electric heating and providing a model for other states.

In addition, Massachusetts began implementing landmark siting and permitting reforms adopted by the state legislature in late 2024. These reforms streamline and speed up the deployment of clean energy infrastructure, while helping ensure robust community engagement and careful consideration of project impacts. This year, the state released draft guidance and proposed regulations on site suitability assessments, cumulative impacts, and related issues. EDF has actively engaged at every stage of this process and remains committed to supporting the successful implementation of these critical reforms.

New Jersey protected customers and stopped costly hydrogen blending experiments

New Jersey regulators rejected a utility proposal to make customers pay for unproductive experiments blending hydrogen and biomethane – rebranded as “renewable natural gas” –into the gas system. EDF helped negotiate a settlement that scales back Public Service Electric & Gas’ (PSE&G) planned infrastructure spending, protecting households from unnecessary costs and keeping the state focused on cleaner, proven, and more affordable solutions. EDF also commissioned a study showing that PSE&G’s proposed hydrogen blending is far less efficient than helping customers electrify home heating with heat pumps.

A year of progress despite Washington’s attempts to reverse course

In a year when the Trump administration focused on undermining climate progress and helped drive up electricity costs, states showed what real leadership looks like. They cut unjustified rate hikes, rejected wasteful gas spending, required utilities to invest in modernizing the grid, expanded clean energy and secured fairer, more affordable electric rates for millions of families.

The message from 2025 is clear: a cleaner, more affordable, and fairer electricity system is possible, and EDF is committed to helping states deliver on this promise for everyone.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//couplelookingatbills.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:59:01.224977

The groups are led by the Oregon Environmental Council, and include the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Public Citizen, Hopi Utilities Corporation, Woven Energy, the city and county of San Francisco and the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.

“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC, in a press release. “This is bad for clean energy, bad for workers and communities, bad for the air we all breathe, and horrible for Americans squeezed by higher utility bills.”

The lawsuit concerns an executive order issued by President Donald Trump following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July that removed a safe harbor clause specifically for solar and wind projects. Safe harbor lets projects eligible for tax credits still qualify for the subsidies if they complete an established percentage of the project before a deadline.

Disclosure: The Southern Environmental Law Center is a VPM sponsor.","The State Corporation Commission suspended its approval of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center — a planned Dominion Energy Virginia natural gas plant that has drawn significant opposition from Central Virginia residents and environmental groups.

Regulators said in a short filing Tuesday that the suspension will allow them more time to consider an appeal filed on Monday by Appalachian Voices, the NAACP and Mothers Out Front. Those groups opposed the plant and are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center.

Their appeal petition argued that the SCC failed to consider emissions impacts on fenceline communities as required under the state's environmental justice law, instead leaving that to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.

The EJ law defines a fenceline community as ""an area that contains all or part of a low-income community or community of color and that presents an increased health risk to its residents due to its proximity to a major source of pollution.""

The commission's Nov. 25 final order said CERC would have smaller local health impacts than the coal plant that operated on the same property from 1952 until 2023.

The appeal challenged that conclusion: ""With all due respect, that methodology countermands the fundamental goals of the VEJA; it would encourage constructing new fossil fuel infrastructure at locations that have historically housed such infrastructure, ensuring those communities continue to experience harms.""

Environmental advocates also argued that Dominion must meet energy efficiency targets under state law in order to build new fossil fuel power plants — targets that the utility has not met. That requirement can be superseded if there is a demonstrated need for more electricity production to avoid reliability issues; regulators said in their November order that need does exist.

That's another issue raised by the appeal: how the threat to reliability was determined. Appellants argued that Dominion provided ""minimal evidence"" of its claim that CERC is necessary to prevent rolling blackouts, brownouts, or other consequences.

The SCC cited modelling and statements from Dominion, PJM Interconnection (which operates the regional electric grid capacity market) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation in deciding that additional generation is needed by 2029.

The state commission's acceptance of the appeal isn't necessarily a sign that regulators agree with its arguments, nor that the SCC will change its November decision in approving the plant. SELC attorney Grayson Holmes said he appreciated their willingness to take a closer look.

""We hope the Commission will recognize that permitting Dominion to claim this narrow exception on flimsy evidence sets a bad precedent—effectively suggesting that any future gas proposals could easily clear this hurdle, even if they are not the cleanest or most economic option,"" Holmes said in a press release.

Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said in a statement that CERC is ""an important part of Virginia's all of the above strategy to ensure our region has the reliable power we need.""

""We stand behind the SCC's approval of the project,"" Slayton wrote Thursday. ""It was approved after a year of exhaustive review, an extensive public hearing and participation by thousands of Virginians.""

A new analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund highlights premium cost increases in 13 states where Republican senators could face accountability from voters, are retiring, or may otherwise be persuadable.

After months of congressional Republican obstruction, a discharge petition will force the House to vote in January on a clean, three-year extension of the ACA’s enhanced tax credits. This vote creates a clear path forward to preserving affordability. But preventing massive premium increases ultimately depends on whether the Senate acts to protect families from higher health insurance costs.

“Republican senators no longer get to hide behind House gridlock, it appears,” said Natasha Murphy, director of Health Policy at CAP Action and co-author of the analysis. “The path to stopping premium spikes in 2026 is clear, and the question now is whether Senate Republicans will step up for families or allow costs to skyrocket.”

The analysis finds that, without action, Americans could see significant increases in their health care premium costs, including:

Anchorage, Alaska: A family of four earning $161,000 would pay $25,300 more annually.

Portland, Maine: A single parent earning $85,000 would pay $12,700 more annually.

Instead, it left homeowners dealing with a bankrupt company and nowhere to turn for help.

Nearly two years ago, Gov. Dan McKee announced the Affordable Solar Access Pathways (ASAP) program. The idea behind it was simple: provide cash incentives for homeowners in low-income and environmental justice zones to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.

The state, using money from the Renewable Energy Fund, would give incentives to a vendor to provide solar panels, leases and power-purchase agreements to qualifying homeowners. Leases would be signed for 25 years. The state would also provide energy efficiency measures and a home energy audit to the homeowners, at no cost to them, as part of the program.

The idea behind the initiative was to spur solar panel adoption among low-income homeowners and lower their energy costs. Areas of Woonsocket, Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, Cranston, West Warwick, East Providence, Warren, Middletown, and Newport would be eligible to apply.

The only other requirement for households was to have a roof in good condition and have an income at or below 80% of the state median. There was no credit score required, and homeowners in default electric service could apply. The program, as designed, was guaranteed to provide savings for homeowners in the first year.

“Low-to-moderate income communities have been historically underserved in the solar marketplace and often experience the negative impacts of climate change firsthand,” McKee said in a January 2024 press release announcing the launch of the program. “Providing environmental justice communities with affordable access to rooftop solar is essential to ensure all Rhode Islanders benefit from the renewable energy transition.”

The state hired PosiGen, a Saint Rose, La.-based company, to administer the program, which was similar to the service PosiGen provided, except the state would subsidize a big chunk of the leases for enrollees in the program.

PosiGen ultimately owned the solar panels and the leases, and households in the program were actually paying back the company, not the state. That’s how its business model worked: the company installed the solar panels at no cost, recouping costs entirely via the lease payments.

The $1 million in incentives from the Renewable Energy Fund would provide between 200 and 300 homes with solar panels, according to the program launch’s press release.

By August 2024, 116 households had signed contracts with PosiGen, with the state estimating the first year of energy savings to be $830 in electrical costs. The effective price of the energy was 13 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the program metrics recorded by the state Office of Energy Resources (OER) — the last resort service rates last winter and this winter were 16.39 cents and 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour respectively.

The program was, by all measures, succeeding. It was putting solar panels on the roofs of low-income homeowners in environmental justice zones — areas determined by the state to suffer adverse environmental and public health consequences usually caused by pollution — and lowering their winter electricity costs. But developments with PosiGen in recent months have put the program, and its enrollees, in uncertain waters.

Last month PosiGen filed for bankruptcy, and it’s not clear what will happen to the Rhode Islanders who signed contracts in the solar program. State officials aren’t saying much.

“It’s too soon to determine,” said Matthew Touchette, director of communications for the state Executive Office of Commerce. Touchette declined to provide ecoRI News with a copy of the PosiGen contract, saying a request for the document must go through open records request procedures.

Beadle said both state agencies are committed to offering a low-income solar program, but had not made a decision on either finding a new vendor or pursuing a different program. The existing program still has one thing left: money. Touchette told ecoRI News the ASAP program still had most of its funding; $842,199 was left when the program was paused.

On Aug. 24, PosiGen laid off nearly its entire staff. The company at that point had furnished solar power for some 40,000 residential customers across 15 states.

Solar Power World, a solar industry trade publication, reported that thanks to the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” clawing back tax credits related to renewable energy, the company had failed to make interest payments on some of its debt, and the company’s investors declined to put more money into the company.

With not enough cash left in the bank to cover its operating expenses, PosiGen moved to lay off most of its staff instead, many of whom were caught unaware. OER and Rhode Island Commerce paused applications for the ASAP program shortly after, and have yet to find a new vendor to run the program.

On the state’s ASAP webpage, consumers are told to contact the company: “If you are a current ASAP participant with questions about your project or billing, please contact PosiGen customer service at 888-939-4442.”

The company remained in something of a holding pattern until last month. Reuters reported the company filed for Chapter 11 protections in Texas in November, and the company has been working its way through bankruptcy court. The company has $206 million in funded debt and its primary lender, Brookfield Asset Management, wants to foreclose on its assets and transfer the customers to a new solar power provider.

Part of PosiGen’s problems was its core business model. PosiGen provided solar panels at no cost to the consumer, instead of recouping expenses through the 25-year leases, as well as selling tax credits and the revenue from the leases to investors.

The second coming of the Trump administration was an existential crisis for PosiGen and the larger renewable energy industry in the United States. Trump’s hostility to renewables has been well documented. And when Congress passed the “Big Beautiful Bill” this past summer, it sunset or slashed dozens of tax credits used by the industry, which has as a result sharply reduced its expectations for expansion in the coming years.

In an increasingly divided country, Environment America’s longstanding focus on bringing people together to protect the natural world led to relationships with new and sometimes unconventional allies — and to results that every American can benefit from.

“America has the greatest outdoors on the planet. If there’s one thing that gave me hope in 2025, it was seeing people who share that belief come together across the nation and political spectrum to take action,” said Environment America’s Executive Director Lisa Frank. “Americans worked shoulder to shoulder to protect public lands, invest in wildlife crossings and clean up our waterways. Our resolution for 2026 is to continue working with everyone who values the natural places and species that make this country special, as we near its 250th birthday.”

Environment America and its state groups celebrated the following highlights and milestones in 2025:

Safeguarding America’s treasured natural spaces

This summer, when Congress mulled over a proposal to sell off up to 1.2 million acres of public lands, we joined with a broad, bipartisan movement of ranchers, hunters, hikers, climbers and conservationists to successfully convince lawmakers to withdraw the plan.

In Georgia, we worked with our supporters and allies to build public opposition to a mining project just three miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The large number of opponents eventually helped conservation allies purchase the land so that no one can mine there. The proposed project would have involved digging for titanium dioxide, a chemical the EU has determined isn’t safe in food, yet U.S. companies use as a whitener in cookies, toothpaste, salad dressing and other things. Thankfully, Georgians across the political spectrum thought it was more important to preserve this unique place of natural beauty than to have more of an unnecessary food additive.

We continued working in Minnesota to urge decision makers to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness from proposed copper sulfide mining that could leak acidic drainage and toxic metals into the region’s many interconnected lakes and streams. Our staff and volunteers educated the public and built support for stronger protections for this beloved wilderness.

Additionally, alongside our allies, partners and members, we submitted more than 600,000 comments opposing opening millions of acres of our last wild national forests to large-scale, industrial and commercial logging. Across 45 million acres and 37 states, these special forest places are home to countless animals and are essential to the way of life of hunters, anglers, hikers and others who cherish the access they provide to America’s great outdoors.

Bipartisan momentum behind wildlife crossings

Every year, vehicle collisions kill between 1 and 2 million large animals and put countless drivers at risk. Wildlife crossings can dramatically reduce these collisions while reconnecting fragmented landscapes. Environment America’s state and national staff have been actively supporting and promoting the construction of these crossings, including in California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Washington and Oregon.

We worked to shore up support for state and federal legislation and programs that will invest in these important infrastructure projects. This includes urging Congress to reauthorize the Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program, which would provide funding for crossing projects across the nation.

We also cultivated a broad coalition to advance the Wildlife Movement through Partnerships Act. This bipartisan effort included nearly one hundred groups and businesses such as sportsman’s clubs, rod and gun clubs, outfitters and guide services. The proposed legislation would direct agencies to coordinate research, action and funding that would allow for new wildlife corridors and effective crossing projects where they are needed most.

Meanwhile, our canvassing operations engaged thousands of people by knocking on their doors, successfully building public awareness about how wildlife crossings and corridors mitigate collisions, save lives and restore habitat connectivity.

Finally, in Idaho, Environment America and its partners reached an agreement with the mining company P4 Production to fund improvements to a critical mule deer migration corridor near Soda Springs. The Soda Hills mule deer herd follows ancient seasonal routes now threatened by fences, highways and development. The project will help restore those pathways so deer can safely move between their summer and winter ranges.

Tackling plastic pollution through citizen science, state laws

This spring, Environment America Research & Policy Center and its partners organized the first International Plastic Pellet Count, a global citizen science effort to track “nurdles,” the tiny pellets used as raw material for plastic products.

More than 1,100 volunteers collected 49,256 pellets across 200 sites in 14 countries and 29 U.S. states, showing just how widespread this pellet pollution has become.

The participants not only cleaned up thousands of pellets, but also helped provide crucial data to build public awareness and momentum for rules and policies to curb plastic pellet pollution at the source.

In Oregon, we played a crucial role in launching an ambitious producer responsibility law for packaging and paper products. The state’s Recycling Modernization Act gives more Oregonians access to curbside recycling, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, producers of packaging and paper products will now share the costs of improving the recycling system.

We also supported Washington state’s Recycling Reform Act, which will expand curbside recycling to hundreds of thousands of additional homes, require companies to help pay for the waste their packaging creates and simplify recycling rules with a uniform statewide list. We supported similar laws in other states including Colorado, California, Minnesota and Maryland.

Landmark court victories: making polluters pay

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court denied ExxonMobil Corporation’s petition asking the justices to take up an appeal of the company’s record-setting loss in a Clean Air Act enforcement suit. Environment Texas, the National Environmental Law Center and Sierra Club filed that suit in 2010.

The suit cited repeated violations at the company’s Baytown, Texas, oil refinery and chemical plant complex. It resulted in a $14.25 million civil penalty against Exxon — the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in a citizen-initiated public interest lawsuit to enforce the Clean Air Act.

Then, in September, our partners at PennEnvironment, alongside Three Rivers Waterkeeper, reached a major settlement with Styropek USA after documenting nurdles from its facility washing into the nearby Raccoon Creek and Ohio River system. Pellets were found on the water’s surface, in sediment and even caught in shoreline vegetation downstream of Styropek’s plastic facility.

Under the agreement, Styropek will pay $2.6 million in penalties and must completely redesign its stormwater collection and treatment systems to capture all of its pellet waste. The company will also install real-time monitoring at every outfall, with automatic penalties if even a single pellet escapes.

One mission: protecting the natural world

Looking back on these highlights from 2025, we’re proud of what we, our partners across the political spectrum and members have achieved. In 2026, we look forward to building on these accomplishments, and more, in service of our sole mission: to protect the natural world.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_AME.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:00:14.454401

The researchers used data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to see if the benefits of federal environmental regulations, such as the estimated number of asthma attacks prevented by air pollution regulations, outweigh the costs to comply with and enforce environmental protection rules. The team found that the benefits — calculated by looking at medical costs and financial losses from missed work, decreasing premature deaths and reducing the prevalence of diseases like lung and bladder cancer and cardiovascular issues — are up to five and six times higher than the costs associated with implementing the rules.

In the following Q&A, study co-author Onur Apul, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State, discussed the societal impacts of environmental protection

Q: What do you mean when you say “environmental protection”?

Apul: The U.S. EPA protects human health and the environment by developing and enforcing regulations based on environmental laws passed by Congress. In addition, EPA conducts scientific research, sets national standards for air, water and soil quality, and works with states to address local pollution issues and minimize environmental risks.

Q: How have environmental regulations impacted public health and the economy over the past 50 years?

Apul: The message of our article is very simple: Environmental protection is good for public health and the American economy. Protecting our environment is not an expense, it's cost-saving. It’s like conserving energy in your house: It may look expensive at first — you have to install nice windows, maybe insulated heat exchangers — but in the long term you're going to be saving energy and saving money.

In our article, we went to the EPA’s databases and extracted how much it costs, for example, to remediate arsenic from drinking water versus implementing and enforcing a federal-level rule regulating arsenic in drinking water. Then we looked at EPA benefit computations, like how much does it cost to lose a young person from the workforce because of a sickness? We did a summary of all major EPA environmental rules and concluded that environmental protection is a cost-savings. In some cases, it's five times; in some cases, 10 times more beneficial than the costs associated with implementing and enforcing the regulations.

For example, the Clean Air Act is predicted to prevent 100 million asthma attacks by 2050. What's the average cost or benefit of not having an asthma attack? This corresponds to about 200,000 fatalities prevented. Or look at the Lead and Copper Rule, which regulates lead and copper in drinking water and prevents almost 1 million infants per year from having low birth weight.

Q: You noted that for the past 20 years, about 24 new chemicals have been registered every minute. How many chemicals does the EPA regulate?

Apul: Think about how many chemicals you use daily. Think about the paints, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter painkillers people use each day. The American Chemical Society Chemical Abstract Service lists about 275 million chemicals. That means 24 new chemicals have been registered every minute over the past 20 years, but the EPA regulates fewer than 100 contaminants out of 275 million. Advancing science, advancing engineering, increases life expectancy and environmental protection is one of those advancements, improving our quality of life by preventing child deaths, unexpected disease-related deaths and pollution-related deaths.

Q: How much does it cost to run the EPA?

Apul: The EPA’s operating budget is tiny compared to the total federal budget and the country’s GDP. The EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2024 was about $10 billion, or less than 0.15% of total government spending. That’s 0.03% of U.S. GDP. And in 2024 the EPA employed only about 15,000 people who regulate all these compounds, contribute to research, contribute to policy making, engage with communities and direct messaging. This small number of people, working on a small budget compared to total government spending and the nation’s GDP, help to protect the environment, preserve natural resources and save lives.

The French automaker could introduce a successor to the C1 that echoes the iconic 2CV’s character while looking completely different, according to Autocar reports. This would position Citroen among Europe’s most affordable electric options.

Consumers have been pushing for genuinely affordable electric vehicles for years without much success in Western markets. Battery packs remain the priciest component despite steady cost reductions over recent years. Most Western-market EVs start above $30,000, excluding many buyers seeking economical transportation options.

Chinese manufacturers produce models under $15,000 for their domestic market, but trade restrictions and certification requirements block their entry into American and European markets. This affordability gap outside China frustrates consumers wanting to abandon fossil fuels without exceeding their budgets.

Britain’s Dacia Spring retails for around $18,750, establishing the current European baseline for electric affordability. BYD’s Dolphin Surf starts at $23,300, several thousand dollars more expensive than the new Citroen. The French automaker’s potential model might price lower than both options if the proposed regulations pass. The new classification aims to reduce the financial burden of manufacturing small, inexpensive vehicles by easing certain compliance standards.

Brussels is weighing this framework after manufacturers complained that current rules make entry-level production economically impossible. The category would relax requirements these vehicles must satisfy.

Similar to the United States, Europe finds building genuinely inexpensive cars increasingly difficult under existing mandates and regulations. This proposal seeks to revive affordability across the segment. Its ultimate direction remains unclear.

Implementation would probably involve compromising some protection standards and oversight measures that ostensibly serve valid purposes. Citroen’s chief executive Xavier Chardon endorsed the potential ruleset during recent statements. He suggested approval would probably allow the French automaker to re-enter the smallest vehicle category it previously exited due to economic pressures.

Delivering a sub-$20,000 EV in Western countries demands several advances beyond regulatory adjustments alone. Battery expenses must keep declining while production efficiency rises substantially.

Western manufacturers need to implement cost-cutting manufacturing methods without quality sacrifice. Volume becomes essential as increased output reduces individual unit expenses significantly. Tax credits could fill remaining price differences, though recent policy shifts eliminated numerous purchase incentives that previously improved affordability for buyers. Material breakthroughs might decrease reliance on costly parts and components.

Simplified configurations with reduced amenities could lower prices, though buyers might reject bare-bones products missing features they consider standard equipment. The obstacle isn’t purely engineering but also consumer expectations, since Western purchasers may anticipate comforts that Chinese buyers willingly forgo for lower costs.

For entities like Ferrari N.V. (NYSE: RACE) that focus on the luxury segment of the auto industry, concerns about affordability aren’t as strong, since the buyers they target only need to be convinced about the quality and exclusivity of the new electric models made as an alternative to the gasoline versions they have relied on for decades.

Key developments

The U.S. Department of Commerce will seek feedback from stakeholders between January 1, 2026 and 11:59 p.m. ET on January 14, 2026 on including new auto parts and components within the scope of sectoral tariffs, according to a notice published this week.

Business and industry stakeholders that testified during a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) public hearing on December 3-5, 2025, urged caution against destroying the benefits of the agreement while noting there is room for improvement. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is expected to provide a report to Congress regarding its USMCA position by early January, in preparation for ongoing negotiations ahead of the July 1, 2026 deadline to conclude the review.

In a statement on the USTR review of the USMCA, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) urged the administration to “preserve the core structure of the USMCA while pursuing targeted refinements, adequate transition periods, and measures that further incentivize North American supply chain resilience.”

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) stated the “U.S. should preserve and strengthen the USMCA during the agreement’s six-year review,” but seek targeted revisions in areas that include reducing red tape at the border, promoting greater use of USMCA preferences, addressing unfair competition, and working with North American partners on “regional economic security issues instead of levying Section 232 tariffs.”

In recent remarks to The Wall Street Journal and POLITICO, USTR Jamieson Greer suggested the USMCA could be split into separate deals, and commented that withdrawal from the USMCA is “always a scenario.” Greer also stated, “The president’s view is he only wants deals that are a good deal. The reason why we built a review period into USMCA was in case we needed to revise it, review it or exit it.” According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, “any party can invoke USMCA Article 34.6 and exit the agreement with six months’ notice, regardless of the review process.”

The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) predicts 2025 U.S. new light-vehicle sales will “finish the year at 16 million-plus units, given the strong sales performance earlier this year.”

Mexico approved a proposal to impose tariffs of 5% to 50% on more than 1,400 products from China and other nations with which it does not have a free trade agreement.

Shipments across the U.S. – Mexico border could be delayed due to blockades in certain areas that have been coordinated toprotest robberies and assaults on cargo drivers. TRADLINX, a supply chain visibility platform based in Seoul, stated, “For cross-border logistics teams, this is not a one-day headline; it’s an ongoing risk factor for planning U.S.–Mexico freight through the end of the year and into 2026.”

OEMs/SUPPLIERS

Amid heightened market pressures that could lead to increased risk for supplier bankruptcies in 2026, a new Supplier Distress Tracker created by Automotive Newsmonitors for layoff notices, insolvencies and bankruptcies.

The Chinese government is reported to have sought assistance from European automotive trade groups to help facilitate a resolution of ongoing disputes over the operations of Chinese-owned Netherlands-based chipmaker Nexperia.

Automotive News provided an overview of what several major suppliers plan to feature at CES 2026, to be held January 6-9 in Las Vegas.

Detroit Manufacturing Systems, LLC completed its previously announced acquisitions of Android Industries, LLC and Avancez, LLC. The combined entity, Voltava, LLC, has an estimated revenue of $1.77 billion, and it will be headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

GM plans to provide lump-sum payments as part of layoff packages to Unifor Local 88 members as the automaker’s idled CAMI Assembly Plant in Ingersoll, Ontario is “assessed for future opportunities.”

Hyundai and Kia will install theft prevention equipment on all new vehicles and retrofit over 4 million vehicles to resolve an investigation by a bipartisan coalition of 35 attorneys general.

Nissan Americas leader Christian Meunier intends to improve the automaker’s 5% U.S. market share by adjusting production to specific dealer orders, instead of relying on bulk output. The automaker is also considering plans to localize hybrid powertrain production at its plant in Decherd, TN.

MARKET TRENDS AND REGULATORY

U.S. new light-vehicle inventory was estimated at 3.01 million units at the start of December 2025, or a 90 days’ supply industrywide, compared to 2.97 million units at the beginning of November 2025. Inventory across individual brands varied significantly: Lexus and Toyota had the lowest days’ supply, at 44 and 45, respectively, while the highest inventory exceeded a 140 days’ supply for Audi, Jeep, Chrysler, and Lincoln.

Kelley Blue Book data indicates new vehicle average transaction price (ATP) rose 1.3% year-over-year to $49,814 in November, and the average new vehicle manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) has been above $50,000 since April 2025. The average incentive package in November was 6.7% of ATP, compared to 7.9% of ATP in the same period last year. The analysis also noted that new vehicle prices reflect “a market heavily influenced by affluent households.”

Commentary from Edmunds excerpted in CNNand CNBC suggested that certain new-vehicle consumers may “still face a challenging marketplace” despite the Federal Reserve’s December 10 decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. Edmunds estimates the average monthly payment for a new vehicle reached $772 in November 2025, while the average amount financed was close to an all-time high of $44,000.

A report in Automotive News assessed whether vehicle total cost of ownership could increase if automakers deprioritize fuel-saving technologies in response to the Trump administration’s revisions to Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.

The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly planning to delay enforcement of 2027-2032 vehicle pollution rules. The Biden-era standards would require a 50% reduction in certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxides through 2032 for light vehicles, and a 58% reduction for medium-duty vehicles.

A significant portion of vehicles recalled across all reasons – including serious flaws – do not get repaired, according to analysis of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data by The Wall Street Journal.

Car and truck rental company Enterprise Mobility acquired St. Louis-based Hogan for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to support Enterprise Mobility’s entry into the Class 7 and Class 8 heavy-duty truck market.

The European Commission released a proposal to require a 90% reduction of carbon-dioxide tailpipe emissions from baseline levels for new cars sold in the bloc beginning in 2035. The remaining 10% of emissions will have to be offset by sustainable fuels or low-carbon steel made in Europe. The proposal revises a previous target that would have required 100% CO2 emissions reductions for new passenger vehicles sold in the EU by 2035.

In remarks submitted for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged lawmakers to address the competitive threat posed by Chinese manufacturers, and stated, “No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent from happening inside the U.S.”

China’s vehicle exports in the first eleven months of 2025 reached 6.3 million units globally, up 18.7% year-over-year.

Autonomous Technologies and Vehicle Software

Uber plans to offer robotaxi service in more than 10 markets globally by the end of 2026.

Rivian plans to launch an artificial intelligence chip developed in-house, as well as lidar sensors, for its electric R2 models in late 2026. In the coming weeks, Rivian also intends to offer a new Autonomy+ driver-assistance package that will be available for purchase through a software update.

Volvo is considering collaborations that include licensing agreements for its new “Superset” software stack that will run on the automaker’s future EV models.

Detmar Logistics will use trucks equipped with Aurora Innovation’s self-driving technology to autonomously transport fracking sand on public roads and highways in parts of the Permian Basin in Texas.

HYBRID AND Electric Vehicles

Ford will incur approximately $19.5 billion in special charges primarily related to its EV business, and the automaker announced a revised electrification strategy that will prioritize “higher-return opportunities.” By 2030, Ford intends that 50% of its global volume be hybrids, extended-range EVs, and electric vehicles, versus 17% today. Ford lost nearly $13 billion on its EV business since 2023.

A report in The Wall Street Journal described EVs as a “money pit” for U.S. automakers, while noting that scaling back electrification strategies will impede their ability to compete with Chinese automakers.

New EV sales in November 2025 were estimated at 70,255 units in the U.S., falling 41% year-over-year and down 5% from October 2025.

South Korean battery maker SK On will end a battery plant joint venture with Ford as part of a revision to allocate resources to markets such as energy storage systems.

BloombergNEF predicts the average global price for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2026 will drop by 3% year-over-year to $105 per kilowatt-hour.

Paccar units Kenworth Truck and Peterbilt Motors launched new battery-electric tractor and truck models.

The CEO of ChargePoint Holdings indicated that more than 40 states have solicited or signed contracts to build new EV charging stations in recent weeks, located in rural and underserved areas, and “other places where they might not have otherwise made economic sense.” The activity was attributed to the Department of Transportation’s revised guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program issued in August 2025.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over allegations the federal government is blocking congressionally approved funds intended to establish EV charging infrastructure. The funding was established through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program (CFI) and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. A group of environmental organizations filed a separate suit accusing the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration of unlawfully withholding funding for the CFI program.

As of late 2025, the U.S. was estimated to have over 81,000 EV charging stations with more than 250,000 individual charging ports nationwide. This represents a 17% increase compared to the start of 2025.

A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, ""we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill's co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure ""gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win'' on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,"" Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy ... expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.""

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,"" said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,"" he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/ace178b4-e402-4d73-8c5d-fa8a6083e75b/20251218T212013/ace178b4-e402-4d73-8c5d-fa8a6083e75b.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:01:40.323549

Randy Weber for introducing the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act and supports the PACK Act’s creation of a federal framework for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims for consumer packaging under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),” said Lynn Dyer, President of AMERIPEN. “This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging. AMERIPEN will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.”

“The Plastics Industry Association thanks Congressman Weber for introducing the PACK Act,” said Matt Seaholm, PLASTICS President and CEO. “Plastic packaging is essential to modern life—protecting products, keeping food fresh, and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely—yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims. This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.

""The PACK Act would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines. As an industry that employs more than one million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber’s leadership on this important issue that strengthens U.S. manufacturing and consumer confidence.”

“We welcome the introduction of the PACK Act for creating a single, national framework for packaging claims,” said Peter DePasquale, Vice President, Government Affairs, Keurig Dr Pepper. “By setting clear, national standards and certifications through credible third parties, this legislation helps ensure consumers receive accurate information while giving companies the consistency they need to innovate and accelerate investment in sustainable packaging solutions nationwide.""",https://www.packagingstrategies.com/ext/resources/2025/12/us-capitol-hill-closeup-washington-dc-900x550.jpg?height=635&t=1766088737&width=1200,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:11.824629

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania are suing the Trump administration over funding for electric vehicle chargers, as part of a coalition of 17 Democratic attorneys general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. They are alleging the White House is acting unlawfully by withholding funds approved by Congress.

“Without any notice or explanation, the United States Department of Transportation just quietly refused to approve any new funding under the programs which had already been appropriated by Congress and awarded to the states,” said New Jersey Attorney General Michael Platkin.

“This is consistent with how this administration has treated congressional appropriations. They’re not optional. They’re laws,” said Platkin. And the Constitution says that only under limited circumstances can the president, after money has been appropriated by Congress and passed into law, can he restrict those funds from going to their intended recipients.”

New Jersey is waiting on $16 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. Both programs are part of the Biden-era bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Congress passed in 2022.

Platkin said the funds would create new jobs and provide EV drivers greater access to the roads.

“At a time, again, when we’re trying to make energy costs go down,” Platkin said. “We’re trying to make people’s lives easier and more affordable. This makes no sense. It’s illegal, but it also just makes no sense.”

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s actions violate the Constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement that the funds would support “EV construction projects in Pennsylvania and … new, good paying jobs.”

“I will not let the federal government break their word at the expense of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said.

Pennsylvania was awarded funds to construct three charging stations along I-78 and I-81. The joint project involving Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia was awarded $18.6 million.

The effort was part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to tackle climate change.

This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the effort. “While the Administration is busy finding ways for their Big Oil donors to profit, California will continue to fight for its people, environment, and innovation.”

The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment.

But President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’s not a fan of electric vehicles. Trump signed a law that ended EV tax credits and recently weakened fuel efficiency standards, saying that Americans prefer gas-powered vehicles.

The Strategy is intended to guide implementation of the Act on Climate and provides a comprehensive assessment of Rhode Island’s emissions trajectory, programmatic tools, and the feasibility of achieving statutory greenhouse gas reduction mandates under current conditions. Developed in collaboration with the Office of Energy Resources (OER) including significant public input, the strategy outlines a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45% below 1990 levels by 2030.

“The Climate Action Strategy is the result of hard work by all the EC4 agencies and, in particular, the climate teams at OER and DEM. Over the last 14 months they have worked very closely with the experts at Energy, Environment, and Economics, Inc. (E3) who provided contract support and modeling. Throughout the process, we have engaged with many different communities to get meaningful input and feedback,” said DEM Director and EC4 Chair Terry Gray. “This strategy reflects a clear-eyed assessment of today’s landscape and the challenges ahead. Rhode Island was moving in the right direction under the Act, but our efforts are clearly impeded by considerable federal policy changes.”

“The EC4’s approval of this strategy charts a path forward for making progress towards the Act on Climate while recognizing new, significant challenges from the Trump administration,” said OER Acting Energy Commissioner Christopher Kearns. “The core of our climate work is increasing the share of zero-emission energy resources while maintaining electricity affordability for households. Supporting rate stability is a key foundation for meeting our emissions reduction goals, alongside continued investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, heat pumps, pre-weatherization, and energy-efficiency programs that are essential to sustaining progress.”

Since the Act on Climate was signed in 2021, new programs, laws, and regulations have supported the state’s emissions-reduction goals. RI has been a leader in offshore wind development and modeling showed that fully carrying out these initiatives as originally planned would’ve put the state on track achieve the 2030 reduction targets.

Recent federal actions – including tariffs, the rescission of Clean Air Act authorities supporting clean vehicles, the termination of Inflation Reduction Act clean-energy and electric-vehicle tax credits, efforts to stall offshore wind development, and the elimination of programs such as Solar for All – have significantly altered the landscape on which Rhode Island’s climate strategy was built. The updated strategy recognizes that these changes will have immediate and serious consequences for the state’s climate plans. Given these challenges, Rhode Island must adjust its climate planning efforts to reflect the new federal landscape.

A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects and limiting judicial review.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews total hundreds of pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Huffman and other Democrats also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that are being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, ""we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill's co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that ""America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.

Support for the measure ""gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win'' on permitting reform, Golden said.

Ford is also shelving planned electric commercial vans and repositioning its production lines to prioritize trucks, vans, and hybrid vehicles.
One report projected that U.S. energy storage deployments will reach record levels this year amid surging interest.
The move also underscores widening divergence between the EV market and energy storage.
Energy storage markets are competitive, with established players such as Tesla already commanding significant shares of the grid-scale battery business.","Ford Motor Co. is taking a nearly US$20-billion hit on its electric-vehicle investments and redirecting capital toward hybrids and energy storage as U.S. EV demand falters, even though global EV sales remain strong. The strategic overhaul includes cancelling several EV models, expanding hybrid and extended-range vehicles, and repurposing EV battery plants for grid and data-centre storage applications.

Ford framed the move as a “decisive redeployment of capital” in a Monday announcement that accompanies its 2026 business plans, as part of its broader Ford+ strategy. The company plans to redirect investment away from larger EVs that have struggled to meet sales and profitability expectations, and toward products and technologies where it sees stronger near-term returns.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities,” Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said in a company press release outlining the new strategy. That includes expanding its lineup of hybrid and extended-range vehicles, as well as a new battery energy storage systems (BESS) business, which Ford said will use existing battery production capacity in the U.S.

Major write-down underscores EV market headwinds

Ford’s nearly US$19.5 billion impairment charge — one of the largest in recent corporate history — reflects the cancellation of planned EV models, the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korean partner SK On, and other program-related write-downs. About $8.5 billion of the charge relates to scrapped EV projects, including large pickups and vans, while roughly $6 billion reflects the end of the SK On venture and $5 billion covers other program expenses.

Reuters reporting notes that Ford is discontinuing the fully electric F-150 Lightning and its next-generation sibling, the T3, in favour of an extended-range hybrid model that incorporates a gasoline engine to recharge the battery. Ford is also shelving planned electric commercial vans and repositioning its production lines to prioritize trucks, vans, and hybrid vehicles.

The retrenchment comes as U.S. EV sales have faltered — in part due to federal policy changes that ended consumer tax credits and relaxed emissions regulations — and overall EV market penetration has remained lower than earlier projections. According to Reuters, EVs now account for roughly 10 per cent of new vehicle sales in the U.S., compared with about 25 per cent globally.

Battery plants repurposed for grid and data-centre storage

One of the most notable aspects of Ford’s pivot is its intention to repurpose existing EV battery manufacturing capacity to produce large-scale energy storage systems. At its Glendale, Kentucky battery plant — originally built for EV battery production — Ford plans to invest roughly US$2 billion over the next two years to build lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and assemble them into 20-foot energy storage containers with at least 5 megawatt-hours (MWh) of capacity each. The company aims to produce at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

The storage units are intended for grid operators, utilities and data centres, where demand for reliable power buffering and peak shaving is growing rapidly. Analysts say that as data centres and other large energy users seek to manage peak demand and integrate more renewable generation, the market for grid-connected battery systems is expanding quickly. One report projected that U.S. energy storage deployments will reach record levels this year amid surging interest.

In reporting by Canary Media, industry watchers say Ford’s strategy reflects broader trends in the energy transition. “They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at Raymond James, told reporters. “While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Broader industry and market dynamics

Ford’s shift comes amid a broader reevaluation of EV strategies across legacy automakers. General Motors has also taken impairment charges related to EV production, while Stellantis has scaled back some EV plans in favour of hybrid platforms. Reuters coverage notes that many traditional carmakers — constrained by higher development costs, weakening demand and shifting regulatory environments — are returning to hybrid and traditional powertrain investments.

Analysts also point to weakening consumer incentives as a factor. The U.S. federal EV tax credit, once worth up to US$7,500 per vehicle, expired this year following legislative changes, removing a key subsidy that helped boost EV demand earlier in the decade. At the same time, average gasoline prices in the U.S. have fallen below US$3 per gallon in recent months, making conventional vehicles more attractive to cost-conscious buyers.

Strategic reset and future prospects

Ford’s revised approach prioritizes profitability and flexibility. The company says it expects its global mix of hybrids, extended range vehicles and EVs to reach roughly 50 per cent of total volume by 2030, up from about 17 per cent today, suggesting hybrids will play a major role alongside any future EV offerings.

The move also underscores widening divergence between the EV market and energy storage. Where EV sales have slowed, grid storage demand — particularly for data centres and utility applications — remains robust, driven by efforts to stabilise electricity systems and integrate renewables.

Yet Ford’s transition is not without risks. Energy storage markets are competitive, with established players such as Tesla already commanding significant shares of the grid-scale battery business. Whether Ford can carve out a meaningful position in storage while recalibrating its vehicle lineup remains to be seen.

For now, the Detroit automaker is betting that redeploying capital from struggling EV programs into hybrids, extended-range vehicles and energy storage will position it for more sustainable, profitable growth in a shifting automotive and energy landscape.",https://energi.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EV-Big-Guan-Getty-Images.webp,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:51.983478

Here are three reasons why I believe it's best not to buy Tesla stock right now.
Expenses are rising fast Tesla CEO Elon Musk is transitioning his company toward an autonomous vehicle and robotics company.
Following the expiration of the federal EV tax credits, Tesla's vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November -- its lowest monthly sales in years.
However, the November vehicle sales numbers indicate that Tesla and other EV manufacturers have a significant problem on their hands.","Tesla (TSLA +3.44%) has been a fantastic stock for long-term investors, with returns exceeding 3,100% over the past decade. However, the company currently faces significant headwinds, as sales of its electric vehicles (EVs) are slowing, costs are rising, and it places big bets on unproven markets including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs).

It's no surprise, then, that many investors are trying to determine what to do with Tesla stock. Is it a good time to buy with its shares priced under $500, or is it too early to take a risk on the company transitioning toward future technologies when its EV business is slumping?

Here are three reasons why I believe it's best not to buy Tesla stock right now.

1. Expenses are rising fast

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is transitioning his company toward an autonomous vehicle and robotics company. The idea is for Tesla to mass-produce its Optimus robots -- up to 1 million by 2030 -- and for the company to vastly expand its fledgling robotaxi service that's currently only in a handful of cities. It's worth noting Musk said in July the service would cover half the country by the end of the year, which is now, and it's nowhere near achieving this.

There's nothing wrong with Tesla focusing on these two opportunities, considering that AVs could eventually be worth $1.4 trillion by 2040, and humanoid robotics will be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050.

But to achieve its goals, Tesla is spending heavily, and it's likely to increase from here. The company's operating expenses rose by 50% to $3.4 billion in the third quarter, and research and development (R&D) costs jumped 57% to $1.6 billion. Management specifically said the operating cost increase was ""driven by SG&A [selling, general, and administrative], AI and other R&D projects.""

For Tesla to expand into nascent robotics and AV markets, additional billions of dollars will need to be spent at a time when the company's core business -- selling electric vehicles -- isn't doing so hot.

2. Tesla's core business is suffering

It's easy to get caught up in Tesla's big plans to be an autonomous vehicle and robotics company, but Tesla is still primarily an electric vehicle company right now. Unfortunately, business is not so good.

Tesla's net income fell 37% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, leaving the company with significantly less money to reinvest in the business.

Things could be getting worse, too. Following the expiration of the federal EV tax credits, Tesla's vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November -- its lowest monthly sales in years. Tesla's third-quarter results temporarily received a boost as customers rushed to take advantage before credits expired at the end of September, which helped lift Tesla's revenue 12% to $28 billion in the quarter.

However, the November vehicle sales numbers indicate that Tesla and other EV manufacturers have a significant problem on their hands. EVs often cost more than traditional gas-powered vehicles, and after years of inflation and high interest rates, and no more tax credits, there's less demand for EVs than in the recent past.

This would be a significant problem on its own for Tesla, but it's compounded by the fact that the company is spending so much to move into robotics and AVs.

3. Its stock is expensive

Even if Tesla somehow pulls off its transition to AVs and robotics and turns around its stumbling EV business, it doesn't eliminate the fact that investors are paying a high premium for a company as it makes risky moves.

Tesla's shares currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 206, far above the tech sector's average P/E ratio of about 45.

This means Tesla's stock is already priced for perfection at a time of significant transition, falling profit, and increasing expenses. That's too risky for my liking, even if Tesla eventually achieves its goals. I think investors are better off not buying Tesla stock right now, at least waiting until the company can prove that it can reinvigorate sales and earnings from its electric vehicle business.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847339%2Fnewmodely_65.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-18 18:01:40.142986

Hosted by the C2ES Regional Clean Economies Initiative, this cross-sectoral group of energy leaders offered achievable policy solutions to accelerate the development of the critical battery materials supply chain and deliver local economic benefits to the communities of the Southeast.
All agreed that realizing this opportunity requires regional cooperation and intentional, impactful, and intelligent policy solutions at all levels of government.
Our participants recommended financial incentives for domestic production of critical battery materials, paired with demand-side support to promote the consumption of American made products.
In 2026, we’re looking forward to building these big ideas into actionable recommendations through a regional policy roadmap.","In conversations across the Southeast United States this year, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions convened over 150 energy leaders to discuss one of the hottest topics around the American energy economy: critical materials and battery manufacturing. In every conversation, policymakers, companies and other stakeholders highlighted the work to secure a domestic critical materials supply through industrial development and innovation and create new American jobs.

Hosted by the C2ES Regional Clean Economies Initiative, this cross-sectoral group of energy leaders offered achievable policy solutions to accelerate the development of the critical battery materials supply chain and deliver local economic benefits to the communities of the Southeast.

Although near-term projections for the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market have cooled slightly, global battery demand is rising at a rapid pace. Many American companies and communities across the emerging “battery belt” possess the capabilities to supply the key materials and components that go into these products, creating massive opportunity to capture the economic benefits of building out this supply chain domestically.

Through C2ES roundtable convenings in Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia, we gathered expertise from leaders of communities, workers, economic developers, local businesses, academic experts, state policymakers, entrepreneurs and more. Each echoed that the battery industry brings tremendous tangible job creation and investment opportunities to their region. All agreed that realizing this opportunity requires regional cooperation and intentional, impactful, and intelligent policy solutions at all levels of government.

In Tennessee, we heard from startups and Fortune 500 companies alike about the challenges they face in a rapidly shifting policy environment, and the importance of a stable incentive and regulatory structure that enables predictable investment decisions.

In Alabama, we learned about the importance of an integrated economic development and policy strategy that focuses on industry-driven research and development, prioritizes intentional workforce development, and leans into the state’s competitive advantage within the broader regional value chain.

In North Carolina, we explored the many different shapes and sizes of companies and research efforts in this industry that can span raw materials extraction to final battery assembly, and talked about the importance of collaboration among companies, policymakers, and leaders across state lines.

Finally, in Georgia, we learned about how the state’s proactive economic development strategy to land some of the largest electric vehicle and battery factories in the region helped solidify Georgia as an anchor for the many suppliers and innovative technology developers in the region.

Though each of these conversations brought their own unique local opportunities and challenges, we heard a common refrain from the more than 150 leaders brought together: with the right combination of policy support and private sector investment, the Southeast United States is ready and willing to be the center of the global battery industry.

What would that support look like? Our participants recommended financial incentives for domestic production of critical battery materials, paired with demand-side support to promote the consumption of American made products. They talked about stronger coordination and acceleration of cutting-edge research and development efforts, with a focus on integrating industry needs and bridging the gap from pilot projects to commercialization. They highlighted the importance of proactive workforce development that brings current and future workers into the emerging battery industry while prioritizing transferrable skills and pathways to long-term careers in an advanced and rapidly evolving sector. They recommended smart standards and guidelines for building battery manufacturing facilities and battery storage installations that prioritize safety and remain flexible to the unique needs of the communities that host them.

Under the Regional Clean Economies Initiative in 2025, we were able to bring stakeholders new and old, big and small together to land on shared principles and offer smart policy solutions for the Southeast. In 2026, we’re looking forward to building these big ideas into actionable recommendations through a regional policy roadmap. C2ES will reconvene our network of leaders and advocates at a regional summit in April 2026 to finalize this roadmap and work towards domestic energy solutions needed for a thriving, growing economy.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-1570041382-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:56.553474

The Act guts the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – a bedrock environmental protection – to make it easier for Big Oil and other polluting industries to inflict their projects on communities.
By undercutting NEPA, the SPEED Act would allow fossil fuel companies and other polluting corporations to cut corners in environmental reviews; bury information about the risks posed by their dirty, dangerous projects; and silence community opposition.
In response to the SPEED Act’s passage in the House, national environmental groups and organizations representing communities fighting fossil fuel projects said: “The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for.
The SPEED Act would remove that protection, and when public review is cut off and independent science is ignored, corporations get to externalize pollution, illness, flooding, and the loss of livelihoods onto families who never had a say.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the House of Representatives passed the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R. 4776). The Act guts the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – a bedrock environmental protection – to make it easier for Big Oil and other polluting industries to inflict their projects on communities.

By undercutting NEPA, the SPEED Act would allow fossil fuel companies and other polluting corporations to cut corners in environmental reviews; bury information about the risks posed by their dirty, dangerous projects; and silence community opposition. It would also drastically curtail communities’ ability to hold polluters accountable through the courts.

Yesterday, more than 70 organizations sent a letter to members of Congress expressing their strong opposition to the bill.

In response to the SPEED Act’s passage in the House, national environmental groups and organizations representing communities fighting fossil fuel projects said:

“The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for. Instead of pushing the SPEED Act – a bill that would strip away what few legal protections communities still have, weaken safeguards for clean air, land, and water near new industrial development, and sidestep meaningful consultation with federally recognized Tribal Nations – Congress should be advancing real, community-driven permitting reform. Examples include the Environmental Justice for All Act, which lays out meaningful public engagement, strong public-health protections, respect for Tribal sovereignty and consultation obligations, and serious investments in agencies and staff.” – Mar Zepeda Salazar, Legislative Director, Climate Justice Alliance

“The baseline environmental protection found in NEPA is not red tape – it is the public’s seat at the table and one of the only tools communities have to protect their health, homes, and future. The SPEED Act would remove that protection, and when public review is cut off and independent science is ignored, corporations get to externalize pollution, illness, flooding, and the loss of livelihoods onto families who never had a say. The SPEED Act protects corporate interests, not the public, and it should be rejected by any senator who claims to stand with the people.” – James Hiatt, For a Better Bayou

“Organizing in New Mexico, I’ve seen how hard our communities fight just to protect what should never be up for negotiation – our air, our water, our health, and our future. Gutting NEPA is an open invitation for Big Oil to deepen the extraction, pollution, and harm we already face in the Permian Basin, in Greater Chaco, and across our rural, Indigenous, and working-class communities. Instead of weakening our last lines of defense, Congress should be strengthening environmental protections, investing in community-led solutions, and honoring the voices of the people who live with the consequences of extraction every single day.”- Feleecia Guillen, New Mexico Fellow, Institute for Policy Studies

“The SPEED Act represents yet another assault on the health of frontline, Black, Brown, Indigenous and poor white communities that have been designated as sacrifice zones by big polluters who bribe lawmakers with big money to continue a culture of extract, slash, burn, and emit at the expense of oppressed and marginalized peoples. Worse yet, this piece of industry-friendly legislation will take away due process from impacted communities by removing their right to sue big polluters who purposely select the places they call home to be dumped on and contaminated. Rather than speeding up the approval of dirty projects, Congress should increase funding for federal agencies and grassroots organizations accountable to frontline communities to carry out legally defensible and accurate environmental analyses as called for by Reps. Raúl Grijalva and McEachin in their landmark Environmental Justice for All Act.” – Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright, Co-Coordinator Black Alliance for Peace Climate, Environment and Militarism Initiative

“The SPEED Act favors golden calf solutions and the idolatry of profits above a people-centered economy and a planet where we can all thrive. It sacrifices community voices and environmental standards as a hasty concession to industry, allowing fossil fuel and corporate polluters to cut corners, suppress science, and sideline communities during routine review procedures. It is legislation at the expense of community and environmental well-being. We support legislation that upholds justice, stewardship, and the dignity of the human family, rejecting the SPEED Act’s inadequate solutions.” – Pablo DeJesús, Executive Director, Unitarian Universalists for Social Justice

“The SPEED Act is a handout to fossil fuel companies and other big polluters at the expense of working people. Its sponsors include major recipients of Big Oil money like Bruce Westerman and Henry Cuellar. The bill lets the fossil fuel industry steamroll community opposition to their dangerous projects, suppress science on a project’s potential harms, and ignore climate consequences. Our senators must stand up against the SPEED Act’s attempts to undermine democratic decision-making, pollute our communities, and threaten our collective future.” – Allie Rosenbluth, U.S. Campaign Manager, Oil Change International

“Tribal Nations in California are challenged with various laws and policies that perpetuate erasure and uphold extractive economies that lead to irreversible destruction to our lands, waters, and all beings. The SPEED Act will likely deepen the barriers that are imposed on Indigenous Peoples and Indigenous Sovereignty, as this could: reduce the Tribal participation in the environmental reviews, accelerate permitting, and continue the legacy of settler-driven climate catastrophes. Congress must acknowledge that this is not the solution to achieving climate justice and would further burden Indigenous Peoples by diluting our inherent and sovereign rights; all decisions must be rooted in Free, Prior, and Informed consent– not deregulation.” – Starry Insixiengmay (Cahuilla), Ending Extractive Industries in Our Homelands Project Director, Sacred Places Institute For Indigenous Peoples

Backers of AI and other facilities that consume large amounts of power say that co-locating them near power plants offers efficiency benefits, including cutting the need for new transmission lines. Opponents say it can damage grid reliability and raise power bills for surrounding communities by reducing electricity available for public use.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the move will protect consumers in the mid-Atlantic region that serves about a fifth of Americans in 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Laura Swett, the FERC chairman, said the order was a “monumental step towards fortifying America’s national and economic security in the AI revolution,” and would ensure power rates remain “just and reasonable.”

Washington policy advisory firm Capstone called the order a “major victory” for existing nuclear and gas plants, as it directs PJM to implement rules that allow power stations to reduce output to the grid to serve new behind the meter customers such as data centers.

Power bills for the region are expected to continue to rise after PJM on Wednesday reported fresh record-high capacity prices that reflected electricity demand by data centers overtaking supplies.

The expansion of Big Tech’s data centers has driven up so-called capacity prices in PJM by about 1,000% over a roughly two-year period, intensifying energy affordability problems for those living and working in the region.

Rising costs in PJM have hit power bills in the grid’s territory, with some areas seeing a more than 20% jump in utility bills starting from last summer.

FERC took aim at PJM’s open access transmission tariff, which the operator says governs its services in the region to allow for a fair and competitive wholesale electricity market.

The agency said the tariff was “unjust and unreasonable due to a lack of clarity and consistency in the rates, terms, and conditions.” It directed PJM to revise its tariff to detail the terms and conditions for interconnection customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load.

PJM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If passed by the Senate and signed into law, it would slash requirements mandated by the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a foundational environmental law.

NEPA outlines a robust process for environmental reviews based on scientific rigor, transparency and deliberation, all of which require appropriate time and effort. It is also one of the few laws that communities can use to highlight environmental justice concerns.

Below is a statement by David Watkins, director of government affairs for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“This bill is a sizeable holiday gift basket for Big Oil and Gas. It includes goodies like shielding fossil fuel projects from meaningful review or public input before they are permitted, then shielding them from legal recourse after they are approved. Our elected officials are letting people down by supporting this regressive legislation designed to give an antiquated industry more time to profit from their dangerous and deadly polluting at a time when our communities, our economy and our planet need forward-looking clean energy policies. The bill even allows federal agencies to ignore scientific or technical information related to permit applications. Circumventing science and denying reality will only lead to greater harm to our environment and worse outcomes for communities.

“So, while the Trump administration throttles renewable energy projects with one hand, the House has just passed a bill to further advantage the only energy option Big Oil and Gas wants you to have.

This new grant funding will support a wide variety of water infrastructure projects throughout western North Carolina. Projects include drinking water system resiliency and wastewater resiliency improvement in Chimney Rock Village, the Town of Clyde, and the Town of Crossnore.

Governor Stein is committed to rebuilding western North Carolina and helping the region prepare for future storms. This fall, Governor Stein traveled to Marshall to announce a $6 million investment in flood mitigation projects in western North Carolina rivers. This year, Governor Stein has announced more than $356 million in awards to repair and strengthen water systems in areas affected by Hurricane Helene, and more than $850 million in water infrastructure awards statewide. These investments are approved quarterly by the North Carolina State Water Infrastructure Authority. Applications to receive funding for water infrastructure repair and upgrades will be available until March 2, 2026.",https://files.nc.gov/nc-governor/nc-favicon-32x32_0.png?VersionId=Ns0Ul9P9CI4rcB01rpNdQxk.frPQ3U2e,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:33.250985

The nonprofit recipients of $14 billion in climate grants frozen by the Environmental Protection Agency can have their case reheard, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said in a Wednesday ruling.

A three-judge panel had ruled 2-1 on Sept. 2 to uphold the freeze on funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. On Sept. 10, the plaintiffs requested a rehearing en banc, meaning all judges of that particular court would have to hear the case.

The court agreed to that rehearing, and the en banc court will hear further oral arguments in the case on Feb. 24. However, the court left in place the partial administrative stay issued in April, meaning the GGRF grant funding will remain frozen for now.

The majority opinion upholding the funding freeze was filed by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump — Judge Neomi Rao and Judge Gregory Katsas. The panel’s dissenting judge, Nina Pillard, was appointed by President Barack Obama.

“The month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements — with no apparent consideration from the grantees — to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants” Rao and Katsas wrote, adding that “nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed.”

The GGRF provided “nearly $27 billion in competitive grants to mobilize financing and leverage private capital for clean energy and climate projects that reduce pollution – with an emphasis on projects that benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities,” according to a fact sheet produced by the Biden EPA.

Grant recipients included “green bank” nonprofits such as the Climate United coalition, which received almost $7 billion to finance clean energy projects in rural, tribal and low-income communities, and the Coalition for Green Capital, which received $5 billion and was working to design, create and implement other green bank programs.

An amicus curiae brief filed Sept. 17 by Democratic members of Congress said, “After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations.”

They argued that the administration’s attempts to claw back the funding “[ignored] Congressional spending power” and amounted to a “constitutional power grab.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made fraud allegations in March, saying the Biden administration’s rush to award grants before the Trump administration took over was tantamount to “throwing gold bars off the Titanic” and alleged “instances of self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and intentionally reduced agency oversight” within the GGRF program.

Of the full court’s 15 judges, four are Obama appointees, three are Biden appointees, three are Trump appointees, one is an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, and four judges have senior status and would not vote on an en banc petition.

The administration unjustly and arbitrarily singled out solar and wind projects for these more restrictive – and unprecedented – eligibility rules.
“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC.
“The guidance has forced us to change our plans, and the Hopi Utilities Corporation is now racing to qualify for tax credits under the new guidelines.
In rules issued in August, the IRS eliminated the five percent standard for all wind projects and solar projects larger than 1.5 megawatts.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – A broad array of groups with strong interests in clean and affordable energy sued the IRS and Treasury Department over new rules for tax credits that unfairly and illegally discriminate against wind and solar projects.

As part of a series of attacks on wind and solar, the IRS eliminated a key pathway for companies to demonstrate they have begun construction and thus qualify for federal tax credits before they expire on July 4, 2026. The administration unjustly and arbitrarily singled out solar and wind projects for these more restrictive – and unprecedented – eligibility rules.

The IRS guidance “unlawfully changes the tests for beginning of construction for only solar and wind facilities, without providing adequate reasons or data for treating those facilities differently from all other industries,” the filing says. This change is “likely to increase power prices, resulting in higher electric rates and bills for consumers.”

This lawsuit asks the court to declare the rules arbitrary and capricious and reject them, restoring projects’ ability to rely on the prior rules that had been in place for more than a decade.

The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today by a coalition of groups, led by the Oregon Environmental Council. Other plaintiffs are: NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Public Citizen, Hopi Utilities Corporation, Woven Energy, the City and County of San Francisco, and the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.

“Oregon is counting on renewable energy. The Trump administration’s unfair decision to pull the rug out from under wind and solar projects will lock Oregon ratepayers into expensive, polluting energy sources,” said Jana Gastellum, executive director of Oregon Environmental Council. “Oregonians are already paying the price through devastating wildfires, toxic air pollution, and extreme weather. We can't afford to go backwards – not when the climate crisis is worsening, and communities are suffering.”

The filing also notes that this is part of a series of actions by the Trump administration to block renewable energy, listing 11 specific measures it has taken to stop or delay wind or solar projects. Those actions are putting a damper on much-needed new electricity generation, restricting supply just as utility prices are skyrocketing across the nation.

“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC. “This is bad for clean energy, bad for workers and communities, bad for the air we all breathe, and horrible for Americans squeezed by higher utility bills.”

“These new IRS rules have been a harsh blow. We have been counting on new solar projects to get electricity to those without it, help support essential services, and to create and provide jobs,” said Tim Nuvangyaoma, former Chairman of the Hopi Tribe. “The guidance has forced us to change our plans, and the Hopi Utilities Corporation is now racing to qualify for tax credits under the new guidelines. Getting the court to rectify this unjust action would give us the certainty we need.”

""In Maryland, hundreds of thousands of households live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to pay their utility bills,"" said Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp. ""Adding renewable energy lowers those bills and eliminates fuel cost price volatility. The Treasury Department’s guidance is a nonsensical attack on clean energy and an assault on affordable energy at a time when Marylanders can least afford it.""

“Undercutting solar and wind projects will drive up energy prices for average Americans and cities like San Francisco,” said San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu. “Clean energy developers need predictability and certainty to build projects that benefit us all. San Francisco is joining this coalition to fight for our clean energy future and keep energy costs affordable for consumers.”

“The Trump administration’s use of the IRS to target wind and solar energy projects will result in even higher electricity prices for consumers,” said Nandan Joshi, attorney with Public Citizen's Litigation Group. “Congress wanted to encourage investment in new, cleaner power generation without favoring any one technology. By using the tax code to wage war on wind and solar energy, the Trump administration will cause electric bills to rise, workers to lose their jobs, and older, dirtier power plants to spew more pollution into our air.”

Background

Last year’s Republican tax law cut tax credits for solar and wind and provided a transition period for projects that begin construction within a year.

For more than a decade, Congress has established that an energy project could qualify for a tax credit if it began construction on that project before certain statutory deadlines. This provided certainty to companies that their project would qualify for the tax benefits even if they faced unforeseen delays. IRS rules have long held that starting construction could mean either spending five percent of the total project costs or beginning physical work of a significant nature.

The so-called “Five Percent Safe Harbor” is what is at issue in today’s lawsuit.

Days after passage of the tax law, President Trump issued an Executive Order to “eliminate” clean energy incentives. The order specifically directed the agencies to revise the IRS’s guidance on the meaning “beginning of construction” for wind and solar facilities. In rules issued in August, the IRS eliminated the five percent standard for all wind projects and solar projects larger than 1.5 megawatts. The lawsuit today argues IRS’s elimination of that option is without any legal rationale. Moreover, sources like nuclear, geothermal and hydropower did not face these new restrictions.

The case concerns an IRS notice issued on August 15 titled “Beginning of Construction Requirements for Purposes of the Termination of Clean Electricity Production Credits and Clean Electricity Investment Credits for Applicable Wind and Solar Facilities.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:59.718094

This story originally appeared in Canary Media and is republished here with permission.

Ford, a century after it launched the modern automotive era, has given up on its early ambitions to charge into the electrified future.

The company announced that it will delete nearly $20 billion in book value to extricate itself from its EV investments, an eye-popping loss that amounts to one of the biggest corporate impairments ever.

The company, of course, views it differently: The move is a ​“decisive redeployment of capital,” it said on Monday, as it rolled out a string of related strategic changes alongside the write-down.

The pivot hits particularly hard in the southeastern Battery Belt, where Ford had invested in multibillion-dollar BlueOval plants to produce batteries and electric vehicles. The EV battery facility in Glendale, Kentucky, will lay off about 1,600 employees, and local outlet the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported that a Ford factory in Tennessee will hire around 1,000 fewer workers than previously planned, now that it is making gas trucks instead of electric ones.

As Ford retreats from EVs, though, it’s enthusiastically embracing battery-making — announcing plans to repurpose the Kentucky plant to fuel its entrance into the grid storage market. It expects to spend roughly $2 billion over the next two years to launch production of lithium iron phosphate cells and package them into 20-foot containers that hold at least 5 megawatt-hours of storage capacity, equivalent to a Tesla Megapack. The plan is to ship at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

“This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford,” the company said in a statement. Ford also plans to make cells for home battery units at its factory in Marshall, Michigan.

Ford recently cut a deal with partner SK On, the South Korean battery maker, to dissolve their joint venture. Ford will keep the Kentucky battery plant while SK On takes the one at the sprawling BlueOval City complex near Memphis, Tennessee. That means batteries will still be made in that factory, just not exclusively for Ford products.

“They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at financial services firm Raymond James. ​“While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Ford’s sunny rhetoric about a ​“customer-driven shift” can’t hide the sheer enormity of the blow to its overall business.

As of Sept. 30, Ford’s accountants pegged its corporate value at more than $47 billion. Now Ford must lower that by $19.5 billion to reflect the dissolution of the joint venture agreement with SK On and the loss of planned EV models. The company will have to spend money to end production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, switch to producing a gas-and-battery-powered extended-range model, and retool factories for new, non-EV production.

The move comes as EVs account for just about 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S., far below the global figure of 25%. Though EV sales reach new records each year, the rate of growth has slowed, and there’s little reason to expect momentum to improve given recent federal policy changes.

“U.S. EV sales have never lived up to expectations,” said Molchanov. ​“That was true even while the tax credit was in place. Now, there’s no more tax credit, and EV sales have fallen off a proverbial cliff.”

The consumer EV tax credit ended in September as a result of the Republican budget law, taking away an incentive that helped lower or eliminate the premium for buying electric compared to a similar gas-powered model. Now, too, the average price of regular gasoline has dipped below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, while residential electricity prices rose 13% over the first three-quarters of this year, much faster than inflation.

“In terms of commodity prices, this is the worst of both worlds for EVs,” Molchanov said.

Energy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters

Ford’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.

It used to be that EVs were on the exponential growth curve, and stationary storage offered a modest side hustle for any leftover batteries. Now, between American automakers’ apparent inability to make affordable models and the Trump administration’s slashing and burning of federal EV incentives, that market is heading for some doldrums.

Grid battery providers, by contrast, are seeing business surge. Revenue from Tesla’s energy division, home to the Powerwall home battery and Megapack for large-scale storage, grew 67% last year compared to 2023, and broke $10 billion for the first time, even as the company’s market-leading EV business lost revenue.

Overall, the U.S. will install a record amount of battery capacity on the grid this year. Though analysts predict some dropoff over the next couple of years as the industry adapts to new federal anti-China rules, the utility-scale outlook through 2030 has actually increased 15% since the first half of this year, according to industry group American Clean Power.

Demand from AI data centers plays a massive role in that: Hyperscalers are realizing that strategically placed batteries can unlock capacity at critical constrained hours, in some cases letting the companies build computing hubs years earlier than they could if they waited for conventional grid upgrades. Ford, not coincidentally, will target data centers with its new battery products.

The grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China. But when President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, he preserved federal tax incentives for energy storage deployment while adding a new bureaucratic regime to make projects prove they don’t source parts from China in excess of newly set limits.

Starting in 2026, that will push storage developers to source U.S.-made batteries. There aren’t a lot of options today: LG, after making EV batteries in Michigan for years, began producing lithium iron phosphate cells there for grid use earlier this year. Tesla, Fluence, and others are following suit — in fact, the U.S. is on track for self-sufficiency in cell production for grid storage use by the end of 2026, according to the Energy Storage Coalition.

If project developers end up in a race to secure scarce domestic supply come 2027 or 2028, Ford could find eager buyers in spite of its short track record.

Still, that’s no guarantee of success. Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers. Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/04.01.25-KY-Plant-14.webp,N,,2025-12-18 15:00:28.331247

The Paint Bay was reported to have been used to repaint vehicles and other mobile machinery that would fit into the garage-sized bay. Building 541, a former maintenance shop, is also located within the SWMU 52 area. Building 542 has a floor drain connected to an underground pipe that exits the building to the south and then runs southwest to the oil-water separator (Building A541). The floor drain collected wastewater associated with Paint Bay and tire shop operations. The paint bay area includes three 4-foot diameter exhaust fans along the east and south walls to discharge paint fumes and particulates. The east wall discharged fumes through a vented exhaust fume hood. Along the south wall fumes were discharged through two fans located within an exhaust fan housing constructed of plywood and sheet metal. Painting operations were reportedly discontinued at the facility in the mid-1970s.

In 1989, a visual site inspection was conducted. As part of the inspection, the U.S. Army identified staining on the outside wall of Building 542 and on the ground surface around the exhaust fans described above. Through correspondence between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the U.S. Army, SWMU 52 was identified as a potential release site, as certain paints and associated products used at SWMU 52 may have contained hazardous or toxic constituents. The USEPA recognized that the potential for contaminant migration from this site to potential receptors was low (Dames & Moore, 1989).

In 2000, a RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) for soils at SWMU 52 was conducted by Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns & McDonnell). Laboratory analytical data collected during this RFI were later determined to be unreliable due to laboratory malfeasance; therefore, the data was not used and is not presented here.

In 2003, a subsequent RFI at SWMU 52 for soils was conducted by Shaw Environmental, Inc. (Shaw). Four surface soil samples were collected and analyzed for SFAAP metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and phthalates (a subset of semi-volatile organic compounds [SVOCs]). The locations of samples collected during the Shaw RFI were biased toward known potential release sites or potential runoff accumulation areas. Analytical results were non-detect or at concentrations below the residential target media cleanup levels (TMCLs) for all analytes. Based on these results, a request for NFA for soils at SWMU 52 was written by the Army and submitted to KDHE in April 2007. KDHE provided concurrence that the Army had completed all necessary work associated with soil at SWMU 52 on April 1, 2009.

In a letter dated May 8, 2008, KDHE requested that a groundwater investigation be conducted at SWMU 52. In response to this request, a supplemental RFI was conducted by WSP USA Solutions Inc. (WSP) and Burns & McDonell in 2021 to characterize groundwater contaminant concentrations at SWMU 52. As part of the investigation, two groundwater samples were collected downgradient of the potential Building 542 release areas and analyzed for SFAAP metals, VOCs, and phthalates. Analytical results were non-detect or at concentrations below their respective residential TMCLs indicating there is no groundwater contamination originating from SWMU 52.

The KDHE have determined that NFA with restrictions for soil and site-specific groundwater is the appropriate remedy for SWMU 52. No COCs were identified in soil or groundwater. Remaining soil and groundwater contamination as a result of ACM, LBP, or pesticides will be adequately addressed through the restrictions imposed by the EUCA Number 25-EUC-0017. This proposal is based upon KDHE’s review of all available historical documentation regarding the site.",https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 18:02:03.115504

U.S. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge Act, a federal labeling harmonization bill that’s been championed by Ameripen for over a year.

It would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to include certain requirements for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer product packaging, including that they make qualifying claims and are backed by third-party certifications. Packaging that doesn’t meet stated parameters would be prohibited from bearing resin identification codes surrounded by chasing arrows.

The bill also calls for state preemption. “This uniform structure will replace the confusing patchwork of state regulations, helping businesses provide accurate and transparent information across state lines,” Ameripen said in a news release Wednesday.

Dive Insight:

This federal push comes at a time when more packaging stakeholders are raising concerns about how differing state-level packaging regulations could inhibit interstate commerce. It’s also less than a year away from California’s planned implementation of SB 343, a landmark labeling law that will make it illegal for packaging to bear chasing arrows or other recycling indicators unless specific criteria are met.

All the while, unfinished efforts under the Biden administration to get clarity on best practices for sustainability claims by updating the non-binding FTC Green Guides have been quiet under the Trump administration.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Weber said in a statement. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

The bills calls on the FTC to, within a year, establish an advisory council of experts and industry stakeholders to meet annually. Within two years, the FTC would have to issue guidance on third-party certification, including considering different types of packaging materials, colors, shapes and sizes.

The bill text shared by Weber notes various criteria for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer product packaging.

For example, a “recyclable” package must inform consumers about the availability of recycling programs and collection sites where the item is sold by noting the percentage of consumer or communities with access.

At the same time, a package can be exempt from that requirement if “a recycling program or facility isavailable to a substantial majority of consumers or communities in which the consumer product is sold.” A package cannot be deemed recyclable if it’s made from a recyclable material but due to its shape, size or other attributes is not accepted in recycling programs.

“Compostable” claims require “competent and reliable scientific evidence that the packaging is compostable.” And “reusable” claims require that a person provide means for reusing the packaging through a systems of collection and reuse, or offer a product for purchase to reuse the original packaging.

Ameripen says that the third-party certification requirement “allows businesses to utilize a variety of qualified independent parties to certify that packaging meets industry standards and follows the FTC’s ‘Green Guides’ to avoid deceptive claims.”

“This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging,” said Executive Director Lynn Dyer in Weber’s press release. “Ameripen will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.”

Peter DePasquale, vice president of government affairs at Keurig Dr Pepper, said in a statement the bill is a welcome step to establish “a single, national framework for packaging claims.”

“By setting clear, national standards and certifications through credible third parties, this legislation helps ensure consumers receive accurate information while giving companies the consistency they need to innovate and accelerate investment in sustainable packaging solutions nationwide,” DePasquale said.

The Pack Act’s dozens of of other supporters include major packaging companies and CPGs such as Amcor, Anchor Packaging and Dart, and Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Nestlé USA. The legislation is widely supported by different packaging trade groups, including the Plastics Industry Association, EPS Industry Alliance, Biodegradable Products Institute, Can Manufacturers Institute, Carton Council, Foodservice Packaging Institute and more.

Flexible Packaging Association CEO Dan Felton said the group is “thrilled” about the Pack Act’s introduction “and looks forward to fully supporting its passage into law.”

“We believe that a federal law for the labeling of packaging for compostability, recyclability, and reusability that supports existing national labeling programs makes far greater sense than a state-by-state approach of passing related laws and will lead to more — not less — consumers properly handling flexible packaging at its end of life,” Felton said in an emailed statement.

The NMC to LFP macro-story The transition is considerably easier for manufacturers already producing EV batteries using LFP, a chemistry that China has long prioritized, but that did not become the preferred alternative for both stationary storage and EV batteries globally until the early 2020s.
Unlike LFP cells, which typically use a prismatic form factor for storage, NMC cells are often produced as pouch or cylindrical units.
“But it’s very hard to build an energy storage product or cell business if you’re not shipping prismatic LFP.
“Energy storage is one of the most important tools for grid resiliency.","Earlier this week, Ford Motor Company — arguably the most iconic U.S. automaker in the U.S. — began to inch into the energy space. The company, which a century ago revolutionized auto manufacturing through its use of the assembly line, announced plans to repurpose some of its “underutilized” EV manufacturing lines, and use them to build advanced energy storage systems instead.

The automaker said it will change over EV capacity at its plant in Glendale, Kentucky, to manufacture storage systems of five-plus megawatt-hours, which it hopes to start bringing online in 2027. This will be the starting point for a new Ford energy storage business; it plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years “to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid.”

This is the latest, and most high-profile, example of a pivot that has seen a growing group of manufacturers, including LG Energy and SK On, repurposing some of the capacity they built up when U.S. forecasts for EV sales were rosier. (Fellow automaker GM is also participating in the trend, but instead of repurposing lines, it is giving some of its new and used EV batteries to Redwood Energy to deploy in hybrid storage solutions for data centers.)

The Trump administration’s elimination of subsidies for EVs last summer is leaving battery manufacturers with more capacity than they can hope to deploy in the short term. At the same time, the energy storage industry is experiencing some tailwinds; the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill left the full value of its tax credits intact until 2033, as batteries become more important to powering data centers and meeting record load growth.

So, according to Daniel Finn-Foley, director of energy storage at Clean Energy Associates, it’s only logical for an EV battery manufacturer with the requisite expertise, factories, and supply chain already in place to get into the stationary storage business as well. “If you already have a battery plant up and running, converting that to stationary storage is an effort to preserve some of the economic value of that facility when it may otherwise have to close or scale back production,” he told Latitude Media.

The shift, however, is neither cheap nor particularly easy. Analysts estimate the conversion can cost up to a third of a facility’s total capex and take up to 18 months — a timeline reflected in Ford’s plan, which doesn’t see storage capacity coming online until 2027.

From density to lifecycle

As an investor at VC firm Piva Capital, Lee Larson has been in many conversations with both battery companies and automakers about “the shift away from EVs and towards stationary storage,” a trend he says everyone has seen and is trying to understand.

He says that the key element of the shift is the fact that EVs and BESS have a fundamental difference in priorities: EV batteries require high gravimetric energy density to maximize range, while BESS prioritizes cycle life to ensure long-term value.

“In EVs, the watt-hours per kilogram define your range and performance, but EVs only need 1,000 cycles, which, depending on your energy density, could be 300,000 miles of lifetime range,” Larson said. “For energy storage, the metric of value is dollar per cycle… and the leading cells can now get 8,000 cycles or more, which improves the economics over a 20-year lifetime.”

This pivot from prioritizing density to lifecycles drives a shift toward physically larger cells, which require some retooling of the cell line for thicker electrodes and different additives, as well as the replacement of the pack assembly lines to build bigger grid-ready racks instead of flat, thin batteries that can fit into an EV.

The NMC to LFP macro-story

The transition is considerably easier for manufacturers already producing EV batteries using LFP, a chemistry that China has long prioritized, but that did not become the preferred alternative for both stationary storage and EV batteries globally until the early 2020s. Most U.S. factories, however, are built for NMC chemistries, which dominated Western manufacturing in the late 2010s; they largely only started the slow transition to using LFPs after Tesla incorporated them into its standard-range EVs in late 2021.

Unlike LFP cells, which typically use a prismatic form factor for storage, NMC cells are often produced as pouch or cylindrical units. Ryan Gibson, a venture partner at VC firm Eclipse, where he’s helped build companies including sodium-ion battery manufacturer Peak Energy, says this makes things harder, as switching lines from NMC to LFP requires changes not only to the internal chemistry but also to the machinery used to shape the cells.

“When you’re changing the fundamental form factor of the cell, you’re going to be reinvesting considerable capex…It’s a huge hill climb,” Gibson said. “But it’s very hard to build an energy storage product or cell business if you’re not shipping prismatic LFP. So, if your goal is to enter that market and you’re sitting on old capex for old chemistries that can’t sell into that market, you sort of have to switch over.”

In its announcement, Ford said it’s planning to produce LFP prismatic cells for its new storage business, as well as battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems. The company had started introducing LFP batteries for its EVs in 2023, including for its F-150 Lightning trucks; the latter, which is the electric version of one of the best-selling cars in the U.S., was scrapped as part of Monday’s pivot.

Broadly, according to Larson, this EVs-to-storage battery trend is the continuation of the necessary transition from NMC to LFP that was already happening in the market before the policy headwinds against EVs materialized. “Over the past couple of years, most of the non-Chinese players were already struggling with relatively low capacity utilization on their NMC lines,” he said. “The big, broader macro-story here is the rise and dominance of LFP from a cost performance perspective.”

The EV manufacturers’ relatively quick embrace of BESS is also a manifestation of the battery industry’s resilience and ability to adapt to “seismic shifts in the market,” according to Finn-Foley. Just in the past seven years, he noted, the industry went through shifts including a supply crunch that occurred because demand was being eaten up by incentives within South Korea; the sudden shift to LFP batteries from NMC chemistries; and a 10x spike and drop of lithium prices.

“This is an industry that is constantly shifting, and people underestimate the creativity of developers in terms of reducing cost and getting manufacturing online,” he said. “Energy storage is one of the most important tools for grid resiliency. So it’s appropriate that the supply chain itself would be resilient as well. Resiliency is in the DNA of the storage industry itself.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-18T125247.950.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:59:45.505208

The Commission also accepted the final Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement (SGEIS) related to the ZEC program extension proposal and NYSERDA’s petition regarding its Clean Transportation Prize program.

“The decisions we make today support the continued private investment in New York State’s growing clean energy economy,” said Commission Chair Rory M. Christian. “By supporting advanced, emissions-free transportation and generation, we are spurring the creation of a clean energy economy, helping to create good paying jobs, and ensuring that New York’s energy system remains reliable and affordable for customers.”

Clean Energy Standard: The Commission approved, with modifications, NYSERDA’s 2026 CES administrative budget, including funding the ZEC program via an administrative adder. NYSERDA had requested $34.78 million to support the 2026 CES compliance year budget. The Commission ultimately approved a budget of $31.4 million, a 15 percent decrease from the CES 2025 budget. This budget modification was to reflect the current renewable project landscape and reduce the burden on ratepayers. This funding will support NYSERDA’s CES staff salaries and overhead, system development, technical support, and the New York State Cost Recovery Fee. NYSERDA will fund its 2026 CES administrative budget with revenues from previous years including bid fees, alternative compliance payments, and interest income. The ZEC program would continue to be funded with an administrative adder. NYSERDA's CES budget addresses the continued growth of workload for the administration of CES programs including managing more than 100 renewable energy generator contracts.

In a related ZEC action, the Commission accepted the final SGEIS related to the ZEC program extension proposal. With the SGEIS finalized, the Commission may now prepare a findings statement as required under the State Environmental Quality Review Act. A findings statement is required before the Commission may act on the underlying ZEC program extension proposal.

Clean Transportation Prize: The Commission approved, with modifications, NYSERDA’s petition for its Clean Transportation Prize Program. In its petition, NYSERDA requested a two-year extension for nine of the 10 Clean Transportation Prize winners and a five-year extension for one of the Clean Transportation Prize winners. After the petition was filed, NYSERDA submitted a notice advising that two of the awarded projects had been cancelled. Additionally, NYSERDA requested a budget increase of approximately $500,000, or 15 percent, to provide additional program implementation support to administer the program for a longer period than originally anticipated. Finally, the petition proposes additional, publicly available, reporting requirements.

The Commission also approved the additional reporting requirements to ensure greater visibility and oversight of NYSERDA's administration of the Clean Transportation Prize Program, but the Commission denied the budget modification NYSERDA sought because there are now fewer projects to manage.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted.","CAMERON PARISH, La. - Today, three environmental groups filed a challenge to the reissued coastal use permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG export facility.

The Sierra Club, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the challenge in state court, citing the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s failure to provide proper public notice, allow for public comment, or give an opportunity for a public hearing on the agency’s re-issuance of its coastal use permit for construction of the Commonwealth LNG facility. LDCE also relied entirely on the final Commonwealth Environmental Impact Study to re-issue the permit, despite an earlier D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that EIS unlawful, and failed to adequately consider the environmental justice and climate change impacts that a state court judge had ordered in throwing out Commonwealth’s first coastal use permit in October.

If built, Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already staggering permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects. The liquefied methane gas, known as LNG, it would export would have annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 14 coal-fired power plants or 13 million new gasoline powered vehicles.

The Sierra Club, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and Turtle Island Restoration Network released the following statements:

“Commonwealth LNG would destroy vital storm buffers, wetlands, and fishing sites, but LDCE refuses to do the right thing and put a stop to this project,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club Managing Attorney. “The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted. By refusing to allow public comment– and using a faulty study to justify its decision– LDCE is attempting to shrug off its responsibility to represent and protect the people of Louisiana.”

“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, Director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “One of the concerns was for the fishermen in Cameron Parish, and the revised version does not address this issue at all. Our fishermen’s livelihoods are threatened by the pollution and tanker traffic already in the area, yet the department is turning a blind eye toward their struggles. It’s sad when our own state would put a corporation ahead of our fishermen. The department has done nothing more than rubber stamp a permit for an out-of-state corporation that has never cared about our home and never will.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:29.243267

Connecticut’s Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) energy efficiency programs, implemented by Connecticut’s utilities with oversight from DEEP and the state’s Energy Efficiency Board, continue to provide significant energy and bill savings benefits to ratepayers.","(HARTFORD, CT) – Governor Ned Lamont, chairman of the State Bond Commission, today announced that the commission voted at its meeting this morning to approve an allocation of $18 million in bond funding that will be used to establish the Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund – a new state loan and grant program that will assist in making energy efficiency upgrades at existing single-family and multi-family homes and helping residents generate savings on energy bills.

Administered by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), this program will be used to help with the retrofitting costs of items such as the installation of more efficient heating and cooling equipment, building envelope upgrades, and other similar items that produce energy savings. The program will build on the success of DEEP’s most recent barrier remediation program, the Residential Energy Preparation Services program, which recently utilized all its available funding, removing hazards in dozens of homes, clearing the path for money saving efficiency upgrades.

The establishment of the program and its related bond funding was authorized by the Connecticut General Assembly through Public Act 25-125, which Governor Lamont signed into law this summer.

“Energy efficiency improvements are a huge part of the way that savings can be generated on energy bills,” Governor Lamont said. “One of the great things about energy efficient upgrades is that they help reduce costs and increase reliability for all ratepayers – not just the person installing an energy efficient upgrade – by reducing wasted energy across the electric grid. With this funding, we’re also removing barriers that prevent people from being able to install energy efficient upgrades. Everyone should be able to realize the savings that can come from installing energy efficient upgrades in the home. Altogether, these funds will help expand affordable housing in Connecticut by rehabilitating existing housing and integrating energy upgrades that lower utility costs, improve resident comfort, and extend building life.”

“The Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund builds on DEEP’s commitment to addressing high utility costs for low-income residents,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “With housing and utility costs rising, this funding is essential to help residents and developers, who live in or own low income single and multifamily buildings, access weatherization and energy efficiency measures that can lower utility bills, increase comfort and safety, and keep housing costs affordable.”

When the program begins, $12 million from this initial $18 million allocation will be used to provide loans for developers to install energy upgrades and retrofits in existing multifamily affordable housing, including but not limited to more efficient heating and cooling equipment and building envelope upgrades.

The remaining $6 million will go toward removing barriers that prevent people in lower-income, single family homes from making their homes more energy efficient. Barriers include asbestos, knob and tube wiring, mold, and moisture. These barriers disqualify homes from state and federal weatherization and energy upgrade programs, as contractors are unable to move forward with energy audits, window and insulation installation, and other measures if such barriers are present. For example, in 2024, about 30% of Home Energy Solutions – Income Eligible units and 50% of Weatherization Assistance Program units were deferred due to health and safety barriers. Lower-income residents face the highest energy burden, or percentage of gross income spent on energy bills, and without funding for barrier remediation these homes cannot proceed with weatherization work and therefore are not able to improve their energy efficiency, which can save money on utility bills and increase home comfort.

In 2024, DEEP compiled public input related to this funding through a request for information, where respondents highlighted gaps and challenges in the affordable housing energy efficiency space, such as lack of technical assistance, difficultly accessing financing, high costs, health and safety barriers, and market confusion. Additionally, DEEP held three Affordable Multifamily Stakeholder Roundtables in June that produced similar key takeaways and sparked the creation of an interagency working group to discuss coordination among their various affordable multifamily programs.

The next steps in the establishment of the Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund include determining the process to recruit entities that can implement the program. DEEP hopes to solidify a process for entity selection by early to mid-2026, with the goal of initial program launch for both the grants and loans by end of 2026.

Funding complements other recent efforts to reduce energy costs

The funding and establishment of this program complement other efforts Governor Lamont has enacted recently to help reduce energy costs. These include:

Governor Lamont signed energy affordability legislation this year that will save ratepayers at least $300 million on their electricity bills over the next two years, and more in future years.

Public Act 25-173 was a collaborative, bipartisan effort to provide rate relief immediately and over the longer term to Connecticut residents and businesses facing costly utility bills.

Connecticut was recently recognized for its passage of Public Act 25-173 and Public Act 25-125 by the National League of Conservation Voters in its 2025 Clean Energy Report.

The $300 million includes savings to ratepayers of $125 million annually in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027 by shifting hardship protection measure costs off electric bills to state bonds; and $30 million in savings in fiscal year 2026 and $20 million in fiscal year 2027 by shifting electric vehicle charging program costs off electric bills to state bonds.

Connecticut’s Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) energy efficiency programs, implemented by Connecticut’s utilities with oversight from DEEP and the state’s Energy Efficiency Board, continue to provide significant energy and bill savings benefits to ratepayers.

C&LM program investments in 2025 alone are expected to deliver $353 million in bill savings to Connecticut ratepayers over the lifetimes of the installed efficiency measures.

In 2025, an individual Connecticut resident participating in the home energy assessment program through EnergizeCT is expected to receive an average incentive of $1,129, which will result in $2,068 average lifetime bill savings.

Overall, C&LM programs returned $2.38 in benefits for every $1 invested from 2022 to 2024. Benefits are anticipated to increase to $3.30 for every $1 invested in 2025-2027.

Modern life depends on reliable power, fuel, and interconnected systems capable of withstanding increasingly complex physical and cyber threats.

Recognizing this growing challenge, the National Governors Association (NGA), the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) convened state energy leaders, regulators, and advisors for a two-day training in Atlanta.

The event equipped participants with knowledge, partnerships, and practical tools to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions to critical energy systems, enabling states to better safeguard essential services, protect communities, and strengthen resilience against evolving risks.

Day 1

NGA’s Dan Lauf, NARUC’s Lynn Costantini, and NASEO’s Campbell Delahoyde welcomed attendees, emphasizing that critical energy infrastructure serves as the backbone for all other essential services and systems. They noted that securing these systems is becoming increasingly challenging due to their growing interconnectedness, particularly with telecommunications. Collaboration and relationship-building are vital for success, making this meeting especially important.

The program began with an overview of the physical and cyber threats facing the energy sector, focusing on nation-state actors and emerging hazards. Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations, American Gas Association, and Ryan Guest, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager, Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, encouraged attendees to monitor external threats, practice rigorous cyber hygiene, and develop comprehensive incident response playbooks for both cyber and physical threats. State-level preparedness is essential, and the best defense relies on education, trusted intelligence-sharing networks, and vigilant human oversight, especially as AI-driven attacks become more prevalent.

Campbell Delahoyde invited Sunny Wescott, Chief Meteorologist – Federal Emergency Response Official, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Joe Hagerman, Director, Mississippi Development Authority, Energy and Natural Resources Division; and Paul Holloway, Senior Energy Security and Resilience Lead, Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to discuss tools and approaches for forecasting and assessing risks to critical energy infrastructure. The energy security landscape is transforming as severe weather events become more frequent and impactful. States are moving beyond theoretical plans to actionable resilience strategies, such as Mississippi’s county-level resilience reports and Massachusetts’s integration of resilience planning into state hazard mitigation and utility grid modernization plans. These efforts ensure that assessments translate into action rather than remaining as shelf reports.

Mike Robinson, VP, Grid Transformation, Georgia Power Company, delivered a keynote address highlighting the Eastern Interconnection, “the world’s largest machine,” and the deep interconnections among water, gas, energy, and transportation systems. Disruptions in one sector can cascade across others. Robinson advocated for a comprehensive “Three P’s Framework:”

Partnerships with federal, state, and local agencies

Preparedness through risk prediction and cyber-informed engineering

Protection via infrastructure hardening

This approach has proven effective in securing major events such as the Super Bowl and the upcoming World Cup. Robinson emphasized that utilities must be recognized as embedded emergency response partners, essential for maintaining societal stability.

From physical threats to sophisticated cyber-attacks, threats to the nation’s critical energy infrastructure are growing in both scale and complexity. To discuss these issues, Dan Lauf led a panel discussion with Mike Geraghty, Chief Information Security Officer, New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC), and Ryan Guest, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager, E-ISAC. The panel stressed that effective cybersecurity information sharing begins with establishing trust through legal protections, encouraging open communication about security incidents. Proactive notification and large-scale monitoring help identify vulnerabilities before incidents occur. Organizations should monitor threat actors directly, share anonymized lessons learned, and provide actionable intelligence, including remediation guidance and indicators of compromise. Success requires breaking down organizational silos and focusing resources on actively exploited vulnerabilities in critical sectors.

As mentioned in the Keynote address, energy and other infrastructure systems are deeply interconnected. A power outage can quickly impair communications while loss of communications can hinder grid operations, emergency response, and coordination. Water is needed to cool power plants, and power is needed to operate water and wastewater systems. To explore these critical interdependencies and the importance of coordinated planning for effective response, NGA’s Phil Nichols moderated a session with:

Ollie Gagnon, Chief Homeland Security Advisor, Executive Director, Idaho National Laboratory Resilience Optimization Center

Susan Mora, Senior Director, Federal Policy and Stakeholder Relations, Exelon

Chris Boyer, VP Global Public Policy, AT&T

Jon Sparkman, Engineering Director, Tennessee American Water

The panel emphasized that effective energy security requires prioritizing consequence over threat and building resilience rather than merely preventing attacks. Mapping dependencies is complex, but establishing cross-sector relationships is the most practical strategy. The panel discussed the water-energy nexus, infrastructure theft, and the expanding attack surface from wireless and fiber systems.

Just as individuals and communities depend on state and local energy systems, so does defense critical energy infrastructure (DCEI) which plays a vital role in ensuring the readiness and resilience of national defense operations.

NGA’s Jessica Davenport invited the following panelists to provide an overview of DCEI.

Kevin Klein, Director, Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management

Kevin McElyea, Director, Office of Prevention and Security (CIAC), Colorado State Fusion Center

Megan Levy, SLTT Project Manager, Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, U.S. Department of Energy.

Mary Catherine Ott, Associate Principal for Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships, Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (OLDCC), Department of War

The session addressed unique risks from physical and cyber threats and highlighted state-federal coordination for security.

To conclude Day 1, Jenna Johnston of NGA spoke with Kristin Coulter, Communications Director, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, and Dee Anne Odom, General Manager, Alabama Power. The speakers emphasized that during disasters, the public seeks clear answers to three questions: What’s happening? What are officials doing? What should I do? Effective crisis communication requires actionable transparency, plain language, and empathy. Coordination among agencies and pre-event planning are essential for managing information demands and supporting communities during emergencies.

Sheri Haugen-Hoffart, Commissioner, North Dakota Public Service Commission, and Sam Hatcher, Executive Counsel, Office of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, opened Day 2 with a discussion on executive and regulatory authorities relevant to energy security, moderated by Dan Lauf.

Key points included the crucial role of state authorities in energy emergency response. Governors lead by declaring emergencies, which trigger coordinated statewide operations and unlock critical powers, such as lifting truck weight and hours-of-service restrictions to expedite restoration efforts.

While the executive office manages high-level decision-making, federal coordination, and National Guard deployment, regulators focus on technical oversight and utility coordination. Both are united by the principle that their primary role is to support energy companies in restoring service through clear communication and by removing barriers.

Strong coordination is essential during severe events to ensure a prompt and effective response. To explore cross-sector partnerships and highlight strategies and resources for state leaders, Megan Levy sat down with:

Russ Strickland, Secretary, Maryland Department of Emergency Management

Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations, American Gas Association

Kari Heinrich, Energy Security Lead, Wisconsin Public Service Commission

The session emphasized that effective energy security coordination depends on building relationships and establishing procedures before emergencies occur.

Success requires maintaining documented procedures and templates that persist through personnel changes, conducting comprehensive risk assessments that extend beyond internal operations to entire supply chains, and recognizing that regulatory gaps can create systemic vulnerabilities.

These challenges are even greater for remote areas and island communities, which face unique supply chain dynamics. Emerging cybersecurity threats add further complexity to energy security efforts.

To help state officials navigate intra-state and interstate coordination during energy disruptions, Jessica Davenport moderated a session with: A.J. Gary,Director, Homeland Security Advisor, Arkansas Division of Emergency Management, and Kristen Ebert,Director of Business Continuity & Crisis Response, American Electric Power (AEP).

Speakers emphasized that successful energy emergency management depends on building relationships before disasters occur, especially among state energy officials, emergency management directors, and county-level managers. They stressed that emergency requests should flow from the bottom up through proper channels, and that requestors should describe desired outcomes rather than specific resources. This approach allows emergency managers to identify the most effective and cost-efficient solutions.

When state resources are exhausted, the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) enables states to share resources. While some regions also maintain interstate agreements for faster mutual aid without requiring federal declarations.

The energy sector faces increasingly complex cybersecurity challenges that require coordinated, flexible approaches across diverse stakeholders. To address these issues, Lynn Costantini sat down with:

Sharla Artz, Security and Resilience Policy AVP, Xcel Energy

John Ransom, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Grid Security, NRECA

Matt Dale, Chief Cybersecurity Advisors, Virginia State Corporation

The panelists stressed that as an interconnected system where risk to one entity threatens all, the industry must leverage tools to filter overwhelming threat intelligence and distribute actionable mitigations.

Significant resource disparities exist, making one-size-fits-all cybersecurity requirements impractical. This necessitates risk-based, flexible approaches tailored to different utility types and architectures.

Success depends on holistic risk mitigation strategies that address cyber, physical, and environmental threats cost-effectively, as well as more frequent functional exercises to prepare for evolving threats.

In the penultimate session of the day moderator Campbell Delahoyde was joined by Jesse Sythe, E-ISAC GridEx Program Manager, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and Ben Bolton, Assistant Director, Energy Security, Emergency Preparedness & Resilience, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, for a discussion on planning and learning. Sythe shared that GridEx offers free, customizable tabletop materials that can be implemented quickly, making emergency preparedness accessible to resource-constrained entities.

Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, called the plan a “comprehensive affordability package that will serve as Democrats’ roadmap on cost of living issues next year.” Thompson is the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means tax subcommittee.

Whether the package will go very far is highly uncertain. Republicans control the House, Senate and White House and passed a huge tax relief package in July.

And Democrats are not detailing how they will pay for all their proposed tax breaks, saying that will be up to the committee as it considers the legislation next year.

By Deborah Mary Sophia and Timothy Gardner

Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is getting into the fusion power business through a $6 billion merger of his social media firm and Google-backed TAE Technologies, announced just days after industry leaders met with U.S. Energy Department representatives to urge federal funding.

The all-stock deal ​announced on Thursday is an ambitious bet on the power boom spurred by artificial intelligence data-centers and adds to the Trump family's growing roster of diverse ventures ‌from cryptocurrency to real estate holdings and mobile services.

After his return to office this year, Trump's close relatives have pursued ventures leveraging his political power and policy shifts. The Trump family has, for instance, amassed billions in crypto-related ‌wealth as Trump throws his support behind digital financial assets. Greater support from the federal government could potentially boost the value of this investment, as well.

The news put a charge into shares of the money-losing Trump Media on Thursday, sending them up 35%. The stock, popular with retail traders, had lost more than 70% of its value over the last 12 months following a big surge during the 2024 campaign.

""At face value, this is a Barbenheimer mashup. Trump Media gets a dramatic new growth story tied to the AI power crunch and data-center (hyperscaler) electricity demand, while TAE gets ⁠a fast lane to being publicly traded via an all stock ‌merger valued above $6 billion,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.

EFFORTS IN FUSION

The growing electricity needs of the technology industry have in recent months revived interest in nuclear power, including restarting fully shuttered reactors, expanding existing plants and signing contracts for future small ‍modular reactors.

Despite decades of global efforts, nuclear fusion, often seen as a cleaner and reliable power source, has yet to produce a commercially viable reactor.

Shareholders of both companies will own about 50% of the combined entity after the deal closes in mid-2026. Trump Media and Technology Group will be the holding company for businesses including Truth Social platform, TAE Power Solutions, and TAE Life Sciences.

Trump has 114 million shares ​in Trump Media, roughly 40% of the company. In the new merger, his ownership stake would be roughly 20%. The company, which mainly generates revenue from advertising on the ‌Truth Social platform, has consistently clocked losses since its inception, including a loss of $54.8 million in its September-end quarter.

Thursday's rally was a salve for some retail investors who have watched the stock's price fizzle for most of 2025. Chad Nedohin, an Edmonton-based pastor and mechanical engineer in the energy sector, leads one of the largest Trump Media retail investor groups on Truth Social, which has more than 190,000 followers.

Up until the past year, Nedohin had been one of Truth Social’s most influential hype men - but has been frustrated as the stock slumped all year. “I can’t sit here and just be excited about a stock that’s done nothing but stupid stuff until today,"" he said. ""But today was awesome, I think it’s a brilliant move.”

WAVE OF THE FUTURE?

Companies ⁠and physicists at national laboratories have been trying for decades to foster fusion reactions, in which light ​atoms are forced together under extreme temperatures to release huge amounts of energy, a process that fuels the sun.

Big ​hurdles to commercialize fusion include getting more energy out of a reaction than what goes into it and developing plants that can withstand streams of fusion reactions to power the grid.

TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer and other fusion company leaders met with U.S. Energy Department officials this month, weeks after the ‍department formed its first ever fusion office.

Trump Media ⁠agreed to provide up to $200 million in cash to TAE at signing and $100 million more upon initial filing of the registration. The deal has been approved by the companies' boards.

The companies plan to build the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant beginning next year. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a brief, eight-minute investor call ⁠that the companies plan to ""quickly seek approvals"" after the deal closes, with siting for the plant expected to begin by 2026 end.

He will be co-CEO of the new company, along with Binderbauer. The two, along with Donald ‌Trump Jr., will sit on the merged company's board.

The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – is on track to release a draft environmental review by early January with a range of options to replace the river’s operating rules, which are set to expire at the end of 2026.

Several elements of the draft were shared during the annual Colorado River Water Users Association’s conference in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace Wednesday.

Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules will be required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.

Interior Department Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, Andrea Travnicek, said the agency is committed to meeting the self-imposed January deadline in order to finalize new rules before the current ones expire.

“The Department of the Interior recognizes a shrinking timeline is in front of us in order to operate under a new potential agreement,” Travnicek said.

In an unusual move, federal water officials said the draft will not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer, which is typically included in environmental reviews.

“We will not be identifying a preferred alternative, but we anticipate the identification of that between the draft and the final,” said Bureau of Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, Carly Jerla.

Instead, the draft environmental review will list a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply.

“We want to continue to facilitate, but not dictate these operations. The goal here is to inform decision makers and encourage parties to adopt agreements that put consultation and negotiation first,” Jerla continued.

Lower Basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — have been at an impasse for months over how to manage the Colorado River’s shrinking water supplies.

Last month, the states missed a federally-imposed deadline to submit a preliminary seven-state consensus plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines after days of intense closed-door negotiations.

States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.

The Bureau of Reclamation’s Acting Commissioner Scott Cameron said he and other federal officials have intensified efforts to bring states to a consensus, flying out West every other week since early April to meet with the seven states’ river negotiators.

“There are a number of issues from decades past that some people are having some difficulty getting past,” Cameron said, adding that states must “be willing to set aside previous perceived inequities and unfairness.”

One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.

Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.

Despite states missing past deadlines, Cameron said he was “cautiously optimistic” states will reach a consensus deal by the February deadline.

“It’s not unusual in the negotiating process that tougher decisions get made the closer you get to the deadline. And frankly, there are tough decisions that have to be made,” Cameron said.

On Tuesday, California’s biggest water districts said they were willing to “set aside many of their legal positions” in order to reach a seven-state agreement.

The Bureau of Reclamation provided a broad overview of the components that will be included in draft’s range of options, including guidelines to reduce water deliveries from Lake Mead during shortages, coordinated reservoir operations for Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and storage and delivery mechanisms for conserved water.

Jerla, Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, said the draft alternatives will include some components previously proposed by states.

She said the agency has adopted a number of temporary operational agreements since 2008 to address changing conditions on the river. Those agreements have served as test runs for a long term agreement and emphasized the need for more flexibility when managing the river from year-to-year.

“We want to preserve ourselves the flexibility to come back to the table, to do reviews, to make consensus adjustments if needed,” Jerla said.

That flexibility to operations will likely be needed again this year due to a less-than-average upcoming snow season, that combined with a dry spring or early summer in 2026, could create conditions for another low runoff year.

“We’re monitoring the forecast, and we’re seeing not a great start to water year 2026. It’s still early in the year, but the way things are setting up it isn’t looking good,” Jerla said.

The two biggest reservoirs in the country, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are currently at a fraction of their full capacity. Lake Mead is at 32% capacity, while Lake Powell is at 28%.

Additionally, water inflow into the reservoirs in 2026 are projected to most likely be 75% of the average, according to the federal agency. The minimum probable inflow forecast for 2026 is 44% of average, indicating a potentially very dry year.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dsc08945-1024x6831766078804.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=4IhLNUN6,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:25.631818

The legislation will allow America to start building again, which will create new jobs, reduce costs, and unleash American energy. Read the full op-ed below or here(link is external).

The SPEED Act: Helping America build again

The economy(link is external) today faces a large but, thankfully, simple problem. Our demand for energy(link is external) is rising faster than our ability to generate it. The solution is also simple: build more infrastructure(link is external) — more power plants, more roads, and pipelines — so we can produce more energy.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it clear that energy dominance is a priority. The private sector is ready to invest billions in energy abundance, and workers are ready to break ground on next-generation infrastructure. Unfortunately, for decades now, shovel-ready projects across the country have been routinely stalled and even strangled by our antiquated federal permitting system.

As AI data centers and reshored manufacturing drive demand higher, Congress has to decide whether the next decade brings the United States an energy crisis or global energy dominance. Permitting reform — specifically the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act — is a generational opportunity to deliver higher wages and real affordability for working families.

At the heart of permitting dysfunction today is the National Environmental Policy Act. Passed in 1969, NEPA used to require federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of any new government construction project. But five decades of bureaucratic mission creep and agenda-driven lawsuits have twisted the original, sensible law into a black hole of costly red tape.

For construction workers to law professors to small business owners, the very word “NEPA” is today more synonymous with waste and abuse than environmental protection. Consider that the average NEPA Environmental Impact Statement from 2013 to 2018 totaled 575 pages and took nearly five years to complete. A quarter of them took six years or more. These delays cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars.

And even when reviews do get completed, approved projects face a gauntlet of expensive, time-consuming lawsuits. NEPA is the nation’s most litigated and frivolously litigated environmental statute. According to research by the Breakthrough Institute, it takes an average of more than four years to resolve legal challenges after publication of NEPA environmental review documents. And where do these lawsuits come from? Ten extremist environmentalist groups are responsible for 35% of all NEPA lawsuits.

The scrapped Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a textbook case. It was a 600-mile, $8 billion project, initially approved in 2015 to deliver affordable natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. By the time the project was abandoned in 2020, NEPA had delayed it 894 days, and litigation another 570 days. Billions of dollars’ worth of affordable and reliable energy for one of the fastest-growing regions of the country was lost. And all the jobs, economic development, and tax revenue that went with it disappeared in a tsunami of legal fees and broken promises.

These aren’t failures of planning or engineering. They are failures of policy. And in 2025, the federal government’s tolerance for NEPA’s red tape is becoming existential. If the U.S. cannot build energy and mineral infrastructure, China will surpass us in AI technology — for both civilian and military applications. That would have disastrous economic and strategic consequences for America and our allies. If, due to our policy failures, we cede global leadership to China, America would become a less safe, less affordable, and less free country.

A generation from now, we cannot tell our children that a heavily abused permitting process contributed to losing the AI arms race. If Congress passes the SPEED Act, we won’t have to.

The bill, scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives this week, fixes several of NEPA’s systemic problems by restoring the law to its original purpose: a procedural review for proposed projects.

The SPEED Act would restrict NEPA lawsuits to parties actually affected by a project and establish reasonable filing deadlines.

It would codify key elements of the Supreme Court’s Seven County decision, clarifying judicial review in NEPA cases. It would align judicial remedies with the fact that NEPA is, after all, a procedural statute, not a progress impediment.

Finally, the SPEED Act would reaffirm the scope of NEPA reviews as they were initially intended.

The SPEED Act would establish clear rules and a level playing field for federal projects across all agencies and industries. It enjoys bipartisan sponsorship in the House and support from over 300 NEPA-adjacent industries and organizations.

NEPA was originally written to facilitate thoughtful growth, not reckless obstruction. The SPEED Act restores its proper function and will finally empower the people to build. The challenges we face demand that we act. It’s time to pass the SPEED Act and protect America’s future.",https://scalise.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:18.772615

From expanding apprenticeship programs to strengthening career pathways, state leaders took decisive action to address workforce shortages, promote economic mobility and prepare workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Governors and their staff also convened regularly to share best practices and forged new partnerships to ensure their workforce systems remain responsive to both employer needs and worker aspirations.

Strengthening Workforce Programs and Systems

Governors invested significant effort in maximizing federal workforce programs that connect job seekers with training, supportive services and employment opportunities. From SNAP E&T to WIOA administration, state leaders worked to make these systems more effective, accessible and responsive to evolving labor market needs.

Transforming Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Systems

In April 2025, NGA released Governors Reshaping Workforce Development: Turning WIOA Challenges into Workforce Solutions, a comprehensive report examining how Governors leverage their authority under WIOA to design, fund and implement effective workforce development strategies. The research, conducted in partnership with the Harvard Project on Workforce, included in-depth interviews with Governors’ policy advisors in 34 states and technical surveys of workforce administrators in 17 states.

Five Major Trends Identified:

States shifting organizational structures to improve workforce governance, with some creating offices within the Governor’s executive office to coordinate policy

States adopting stakeholder-driven approaches to WIOA planning, integrating it into broader economic development strategies

Significant investment in workforce services for high-growth sectors including clean energy, semiconductor manufacturing, broadband and healthcare

Creative funding solutions to address WIOA limitations, including braiding multiple funding sources and using Governor’s Reserve Funds for innovation

Expansion of training programs and supportive services, with over 80 percent of advisors mentioning youth workforce pipeline initiatives

A congressional briefing on the whitepaper brought together state leaders from Arizona and Tennessee to share their innovative approaches with federal policymakers, emphasizing the need for greater flexibility and sustained funding for workforce systems.

SNAP Employment and Training Innovation

The NGA Center, in partnership with Third Sector Capital Partners, launched a Policy Academy to Strengthen SNAP Employment & Training Delivery in 2024 to support state teams in enacting policy and programmatic changes to improve SNAP E&T delivery and enhance participants’ economic wellbeing. In May 2025, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina were selected to participate in the 2025-2026 cohort. These states received targeted technical assistance to identify and overcome obstacles that hinder effective SNAP E&T implementation. By facilitating coordination between Governors’ offices and key workforce and human services agencies, this policy academy will help states unlock opportunities for SNAP recipients to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

Preparing for Workforce Pell Implementation

Recognizing the transformative potential of expanding federal Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs, NGA launched a Readiness Academy to Support Workforce Pell Implementation. This national project, supported by JPMorgan Chase and developed in partnership with the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, helps states navigate the policy, operational, and strategic choices necessary to make this new funding stream successful. The initiative offers states access to an aligned ecosystem of national support, opportunities to connect with peers, tailored guidance and tools, and a central hub for reliable information from experts and federal partners.

Key Convenings and Policy Institutes

Throughout 2025, NGA convened state workforce leaders for invaluable opportunities for peer learning, federal engagement and the development of innovative solutions to shared challenges.

2025 Winter Workforce Development Policy Institute

The 2025 Winter Workforce Development Policy Institute, held March 12-14 in Washington, D.C., brought together Governors’ workforce development policy advisors, state agency leaders and workforce board chairs from across the nation. The comprehensive three-day program addressed critical topics including disaster response, AI-powered workforce tools, military and veteran career pathways, and performance metrics.

A comprehensive commentary on state and territorial workforce development successes highlighted five major themes emerging from rapid-fire state presentations at the Winter Institute:

Expanding apprenticeship programs for teachers, construction workers, and positions in advanced manufacturing, healthcare, IT and finance

Utilizing AI and innovative technology for workforce service delivery through online career tools and case management systems

Advancing data and accountability systems to track progress toward measurable goals

Implementing strategies to increase labor force participation by addressing barriers like childcare, transportation and housing

Improving workforce system governance through reorganization and better alignment with education systems

Montana Convening: AI and Economic Opportunity

In August 2025, NGA convened state workforce leaders in Montana for the Biannual Workforce Development Policy Institute. Held in Billings August 13-15, this gathering brought together leaders from 37 states and territories to discuss workforce innovation, AI integration and pathways to work.

At the event, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte highlighted his newly-launched 406 JOBS initiative, a unifying framework designed to create four pathways to employment and zero barriers to work, focused on six high-demand sectors. The Institute featured sessions on AI’s impact on the future of work, including presentations from OpenAI’s Chief Economist Dr. Ronnie Chatterji and Pennsylvania’s Director of Digital Strategy Annie Newman, who discussed the state’s pilot program integrating ChatGPT into public sector employee workflows.

Targeted Policy Academies and Initiatives

Throughout 2025, NGA launched and continued several focused policy academies designed to help states develop and implement specific workforce strategies aligned with their Governors’ priorities.

Youth Apprenticeship Expansion

As a national partner in the Partnership to Advance Youth Apprenticeship, NGA launched a Policy Academy to Advance Youth Apprenticeship to help states develop high-quality youth apprenticeship opportunities. Maryland, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington were selected to participate in this yearlong initiative.

Service-to-Career Pathways

In partnership with the Schultz Family Foundation and Annie E. Casey Foundation, NGA selected six states for a Service-to-Career Pathways Policy Academy: Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Vermont. Utah Governor Spencer Cox and Maryland Governor Wes Moore co-chair an Advisory Board providing strategic guidance for the initiative.

The initiative gained momentum with a convening in Salt Lake City, Utah that brought together leaders from 24 states to showcase best practices. Governor Cox kicked off the summit highlighting Utah’s innovative One Utah Service Fellowship and employee service requirements for companies receiving state economic development incentives. Attendees also visited Olympus High School to observe Utah’s Volunteer for Good pilot program in action.

State Government as Model Employer for People with Disabilities

In May 2025, NGA released State Government as a Model Employer for People with Disabilities: A Playbook for Governors, a comprehensive guide highlighting six actionable strategies Governors can use to improve state government career paths for people with disabilities. With state governments employing more than 5.5 million workers nationwide, positioning states as model employers for people with disabilities represents a powerful solution to address both workforce shortages and promote economic inclusion.

Looking Ahead

From expanding apprenticeships, strengthening service pathways, and preparing workers for emerging industries, Governors continue to demonstrate remarkable innovation and a strong commitment to economic mobility.

The work of 2025 demonstrated that when Governors lead with vision, invest in evidence-based strategies, and commit to cross-state collaboration, transformative change becomes possible. The foundations laid this year will continue supporting economic opportunity, workforce readiness, and community prosperity for years to come.",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AdobeStock_1535082983-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:07.254512

Subcommittee Chairman Palmer’s opening statement as prepared for delivery:

“Welcome to today’s hearing before the Subcommittee on Environment. This year, we’ve revisited some of our country’s most important environmental laws and confronted emerging challenges in protecting our environment and promoted a regulatory climate that encourages innovation and economic growth.

“Among other things, we’ve identified shortcomings with the administration of the Toxic Substances Control Act that delay newer, safer chemistries from reaching consumers; explored opportunities to revitalize brownfields sites for crucial infrastructure projects; evaluated the state of technologies to improve our recycling systems; and passed common-sense Clear Air Act reforms.

“Today, we are examining EPA’s decision last year to designate two PFAS chemistries—PFOA and PFOS—as hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as ‘CERCLA’ or the Superfund law. CERLCA was enacted in 1980 to facilitate the cleanup of the most contaminated sites around the country and to establish a scheme to hold liable for cleanup costs the parties responsible for that contamination. Superfund imposes strict, and joint and several liability on parties.

“In other words, a responsible party could be responsible for the entire cost to cleanup a contaminated site even if its contribution to the pollution was minimal. CERCLA includes exemptions as well as defenses to liability for certain parties such as ‘bona fide prospective purchasers’ and ‘innocent landowners,’ as they are referred to. However, in the context of the hazardous substance designations for PFOA and PFOS, there are concerns that the existing exemptions and defenses may not adequately protect a class of parties commonly known as ‘passive receivers’ who did not manufacture or use PFOA or PFOS, but may have acquired, used, or disposed of material containing these chemicals. Today, we will examine the impacts of potential liability for PFAS contamination on these entities. Congress has clarified and expanded liability protections before, such as by passing the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act in 2002. We will consider how concerns about PFAS liability may deter a range of economic activities and whether changes to CERCLA, or other legislative action, are needed.

“Additionally, at our March hearing on reauthorization of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Brownfields Program, we discussed the tremendous potential of the estimated 450,000 brownfields sites in our country for housing important infrastructure such as power generation, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and data centers.

“We hope to examine whether concerns about liability for PFAS hinder the redevelopment of these sites.

“To this end, we welcome Susan Bodine, who previously served as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response at EPA during the George W. Bush Administration and then as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance in the first Trump Administration, in addition to senior staff roles in both the House and the Senate.

“We are also joined by Lawrence Falbe, Chair of the International Council of Shopping Centers Environmental and Land Use Policy Committee. Mr. Falbe will share his experience on how potential PFAS contamination impacts real estate transactions for those seeking to reuse those sites.

“Next, Emily Donovan joins us a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, a grassroots community advocacy organization focused on the presence and impact of certain PFAS in communities. We also welcome Tracy Mehan, who represents the American Water Works Association and served as EPA Assistant Administrator for Water, also during the George W. Bush Administration. I thank all of our Members and witnesses for being here, and I look forward to today’s discussion.”

Click here to read part 1 first!

Why are EVs still so expensive? Will prices come down?

The biggest reason EV prices remain high in Canada is insufficient supply, especially of affordable models. Automakers prioritize markets like California, China, and the European Union where strong regulations require them to sell EVs, and without an EVAS, Canada is treated as a lower-priority market. This limited supply drives up prices and wait times, leads carmakers to focus on large, high-profit luxury models instead of affordable ones, and results in a very small used-EV market because new EV availability has been restricted for years.

Although the good news is that EVs are already effectively cheaper over their lifetime due to major savings on fuel and maintenance, most buyers focus on the sticker price instead of long-term costs. Carmakers are not helping either, as many have phased out affordable models such as the Chevy Bolt while shifting toward expensive luxury EVs. Meanwhile, manufacturers like BYD in China are already selling fully electric vehicles for the equivalent of $14,000 CAD.

The reality is that EVs can be affordable, but traditional automakers often prefer to sell high-profit gasoline trucks and SUVs, which now make up eight out of ten new vehicles sold in Canada and have contributed to Canada having the worst on-road vehicle emissions profile in the world. Incentives alone cannot fix this problem, since automakers frequently respond by raising EV prices so they get a portion of the subsidy.

A strong EV Availability Standard directly addresses these issues by requiring automakers to supply more EVs, including affordable models, to the Canadian market. Regulation that forces a shift to 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035 will push companies to scale production, invest in cost-reducing technology, and bring lower-priced models to Canada, ultimately cutting EV prices by about 20 percent on average and making them far more accessible for consumers.

Will there be enough charging infrastructure?

Canada must expand charging infrastructure, and we are. Thousands of public chargers are being built across the country with federal, provincial, municipal, and private investment. But public charging is only one part of the picture.

Most charging happens at home or at work. Public chargers matter most for long-distance travel, communities without garages or driveways, and equitable access. Charging gaps exist but they’re solvable.

Carmakers claim that without more existing charging infrastructure we will not be able to meet our EV target. Evidence shows that this is false. Our 2023 Report with our partners, shows that expanding public charging universally increases EV market share by only about 1.5%. With the EVAS in place, this number increases significantly. Supply, not charging, is the primary bottleneck.

A strong EVAS improves charging by creating predictable EV demand that attracts private investment. The policy allows automakers to earn compliance credits by funding charging infrastructure, and supporting municipal policies that encourage the installation of charging stations.

Are EV batteries bad for the environment? What about mining?

EV batteries do have environmental impacts, particularly related to mining and manufacturing, but these impacts are significantly smaller than the ongoing damage caused by extracting, refining, and burning fossil fuels. The environmental footprint of gasoline and diesel production is enormous, involving large-scale land destruction, air and water pollution, and the release of billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. In comparison, the materials required for EV batteries are far more limited, and as battery recycling expands, the demand for new mining will continue to decline.

Mining for minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt must be managed responsibly. Environmental Defence supports strong protections for Indigenous rights and local communities, the exclusion of mining from ecologically sensitive areas such as peatlands, and the enforcement of high labour and environmental standards across global supply chains. Ethical sourcing and certification systems can ensure that mining avoids the abuses that have occurred in some parts of the world. It is also important to recognize that the scale of mining required for EVs is small compared to the vast quantities of coal, oil, and gas extracted each year. Unlike fossil fuels, minerals used for batteries can be reused or recovered, which means the need for new mining diminishes over time as recycling systems grow.

Battery manufacturing can be carbon intensive in countries that rely heavily on coal, but this impact is already shrinking. Canada is rapidly expanding EV and battery manufacturing using a much cleaner electricity grid, which reduces the carbon footprint of production. Companies are developing new battery chemistries that use less energy to produce and incorporate more recycled materials. Policies can further reduce emissions by requiring responsible sourcing, cleaner manufacturing processes, and higher recycled content in batteries, all of which strengthen the environmental benefits of EVs.

At the end of their life, EV batteries are not sent to landfills. They can be repurposed for stationary energy storage, where they continue to provide valuable service for many years. Once no longer suitable for reuse, batteries are recycled to recover valuable minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. This reduces the need for new mining and supports the development of a circular battery economy. Canada is becoming a leader in battery recycling technologies, with new facilities capable of extracting and reusing most of the materials in old batteries.

When all stages are considered, EVs provide a large net environmental benefit. They eliminate tailpipe emissions, dramatically reduce air pollution, and produce far fewer greenhouse gases over their lifetime compared to gasoline vehicles. As Canada’s electricity grid gets cleaner, the environmental advantages of EVs will grow even stronger, while fossil fuel vehicles will continue to pollute every kilometre they are driven.

Will EVs lead to job losses?

No. The transition presents one of the largest economic opportunities in modern Canadian history.

Canada’s auto industry, long centered on the production of gas and diesel vehicles, has stagnated in recent years while global electric vehicle manufacturing is accelerating. With the right policy support, Electric Mobility Canada estimates that up to 600,000 jobs could be created in the e-mobility sector by 2035, a transformative opportunity for a sector in need of renewal.

Despite claims from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle manufacturers that the EVAS threatens their survival, evidence suggests otherwise. Research by Équiterre, Environmental Defence and the David Suzuki Foundation shows that even under a stringent EVAS, the industry’s annual profits are projected to rise by 24 per cent between 2023 and 2035.

How far can EVs travel? Is range still a concern?

Range has increased dramatically and continues to improve. The average range of new battery-electric vehicles rose from under 120 km in 2010 to 349 km in 2021, and many current models exceed 400–500 km.

Most Canadians drive less than 50 kilometres per day, which is well below the range of even modest EVs. While range decreases somewhat in winter, it returns in warmer weather. Public fast chargers also support long-distance travel.

Once drivers switch to EVs, range anxiety typically fades. Surveys consistently show high satisfaction with range and winter performance.

What about public transit? Won’t more EVs lead to more congestion and cars on the road?

Electric vehicles are an important tool for reducing emissions, but they are not a complete solution to transportation challenges such as congestion, car dependence, or urban sprawl. We agree that truly sustainable cities cannot rely on every individual owning a personal vehicle. However, it is also true that many Canadians still need cars today, particularly in suburban and rural areas where public transit is limited or nonexistent. In this context, it is essential that people who must rely on cars have access to cleaner options. High costs and limited availability should not prevent Canadians from choosing electric vehicles, especially since Canada currently has one of the most polluting passenger vehicle fleets in the world.

At the same time, improving and expanding public transit is critical. Investments in frequent, reliable, and affordable transit provide real alternatives to driving, especially in denser urban areas. Better transit service, integrated with active transportation networks, helps reduce congestion, lowers emissions, and improves access to jobs and services. Urban design plays a major role as well. Walkable neighbourhoods, protected bike lanes, and infrastructure for e-bikes and other micro-mobility options make it possible for people to replace short car trips with healthier, lower-carbon choices. This is especially important given that the majority of trips in North America are under ten kilometers, distances that can easily be covered by transit, walking, or cycling if the infrastructure is in place.

For the millions of Canadians who still rely on cars because of where they live or work, EVs remain a valuable transitional tool. They significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from necessary trips and help improve air quality in communities, especially along busy corridors. As cities invest in transit and build more complete, walkable neighbourhoods, the demand for personal vehicles can decline over time. But during this transition, ensuring access to affordable electric vehicles helps reduce emissions from the trips that cannot yet be shifted to other modes.

The most sustainable path forward combines EV adoption for trips that genuinely require a car, strong public transit for longer journeys, and active transportation for short daily travel. It also includes smarter land-use planning that reduces overall travel demand. EVs are necessary, but not sufficient on their own. The long-term goal must be a transportation system that gives people real choices, reduces car dependence, and supports healthier, low-carbon communities.

Why don’t we look at incentives rather than regulations?

We support incentives for the purposes of industrial policy, like the United States implemented under Biden by tying eligibility to having the vehicle made in North America.

However, there are several reasons why purchase incentives are less effective than the EVAS at driving EV sales:

When automakers have their EV sales subsidized, they raise the price of EVs to capture a portion of the incentive instead of lowering the price for you. They then use those subsidies to reduce prices on gas cars.

The automaker’s current recommendations are to triple incentives. This costs the federal government more than $54 billion. While the EV standard costs taxpayers nothing.

Finally, in most cases, incentives financially benefit people who would buy an electric car anyways, regardless of whether the subsidy exists or not.

One interesting case is that China has increasingly shifted away from purchase incentives as their primary driver for EV sales and instead focused more on regulations. Since 2011, the average retail price for an EV in China has decreased by 47%, while it has increased by 28% in Europe and 38% in the United States.

Comprehensive research regarding the transition to electric vehicles and how the auto industry is fighting against clean car regulations is included in our recent report, Profiting from Pollution.

What about hydrogen or other alternative fuels?

We will not solve transportation emissions with hydrogen cars. First of all, hydrogen fuel cell technology in cars is not commercially ready to scale up fast like battery-electric cars are, in the short window of time we have to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Secondly, passenger transportation is not appropriate for hydrogen because the technology is too costly and inefficient compared to battery-electric alternatives. For example, to drive the same number of kilometers, the amount of renewable energy needed for a fuel cell vehicle is double what is needed for a battery electric vehicle. Third, most hydrogen created today is not actually green, but in fact created by a carbon intensive process using natural gas (methane) – a fossil fuel.

Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels have been proposed by auto industry lobbyists as a false solution in response to efforts to require the phase out of gas vehicles. E-fuels are made through an expensive process which turns electricity into hydrogen and combined with CO2 to create a liquid fuel that could be pumped in a regular gas car. Put simply, this is just a tactic to keep gasoline cars on the road because no technology exists that would prevent someone from filling up a car with gasoline instead of e-fuels.

Trying to decarbonize cars with e-fuels is like showering with champagne – it would be 43 per cent more expensive for an average driver to fill up with e-fuels instead of gas. E-fuels are also in very short supply, one analysis found that there will only be enough e-fuel in Europe to power 2 per cent of the car fleet by 2035. Trying to use e-fuels in cars takes it away from other applications where it may actually be necessary, such as air travel. This makes it a distraction from real solutions.

Conclusion

Electric vehicles are cleaner, cheaper to operate, and increasingly practical for drivers in every region of Canada—from major cities to rural communities. The main barrier is not technology or infrastructure; it is the lack of strong policy requiring automakers to make EVs available and affordable to Canadians.

The legislation will allow America to start building again, which will create new jobs, reduce costs, and unleash American energy. Read the full op-ed below or here.

The SPEED Act: Helping America build again

The economy today faces a large but, thankfully, simple problem. Our demand for energy is rising faster than our ability to generate it. The solution is also simple: build more infrastructure — more power plants, more roads, and pipelines — so we can produce more energy.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it clear that energy dominance is a priority. The private sector is ready to invest billions in energy abundance, and workers are ready to break ground on next-generation infrastructure. Unfortunately, for decades now, shovel-ready projects across the country have been routinely stalled and even strangled by our antiquated federal permitting system.

As AI data centers and reshored manufacturing drive demand higher, Congress has to decide whether the next decade brings the United States an energy crisis or global energy dominance. Permitting reform — specifically the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act — is a generational opportunity to deliver higher wages and real affordability for working families.

At the heart of permitting dysfunction today is the National Environmental Policy Act. Passed in 1969, NEPA used to require federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of any new government construction project. But five decades of bureaucratic mission creep and agenda-driven lawsuits have twisted the original, sensible law into a black hole of costly red tape.

For construction workers to law professors to small business owners, the very word “NEPA” is today more synonymous with waste and abuse than environmental protection. Consider that the average NEPA Environmental Impact Statement from 2013 to 2018 totaled 575 pages and took nearly five years to complete. A quarter of them took six years or more. These delays cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars.

And even when reviews do get completed, approved projects face a gauntlet of expensive, time-consuming lawsuits. NEPA is the nation’s most litigated and frivolously litigated environmental statute. According to research by the Breakthrough Institute, it takes an average of more than four years to resolve legal challenges after publication of NEPA environmental review documents. And where do these lawsuits come from? Ten extremist environmentalist groups are responsible for 35% of all NEPA lawsuits.

The scrapped Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a textbook case. It was a 600-mile, $8 billion project, initially approved in 2015 to deliver affordable natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. By the time the project was abandoned in 2020, NEPA had delayed it 894 days, and litigation another 570 days. Billions of dollars’ worth of affordable and reliable energy for one of the fastest-growing regions of the country was lost. And all the jobs, economic development, and tax revenue that went with it disappeared in a tsunami of legal fees and broken promises.

These aren’t failures of planning or engineering. They are failures of policy. And in 2025, the federal government’s tolerance for NEPA’s red tape is becoming existential. If the U.S. cannot build energy and mineral infrastructure, China will surpass us in AI technology — for both civilian and military applications. That would have disastrous economic and strategic consequences for America and our allies. If, due to our policy failures, we cede global leadership to China, America would become a less safe, less affordable, and less free country.

A generation from now, we cannot tell our children that a heavily abused permitting process contributed to losing the AI arms race. If Congress passes the SPEED Act, we won’t have to.

The bill, scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives this week, fixes several of NEPA’s systemic problems by restoring the law to its original purpose: a procedural review for proposed projects.

The SPEED Act would restrict NEPA lawsuits to parties actually affected by a project and establish reasonable filing deadlines.

It would codify key elements of the Supreme Court’s Seven County decision, clarifying judicial review in NEPA cases. It would align judicial remedies with the fact that NEPA is, after all, a procedural statute, not a progress impediment.

Finally, the SPEED Act would reaffirm the scope of NEPA reviews as they were initially intended.

The SPEED Act would establish clear rules and a level playing field for federal projects across all agencies and industries. It enjoys bipartisan sponsorship in the House and support from over 300 NEPA-adjacent industries and organizations.

NEPA was originally written to facilitate thoughtful growth, not reckless obstruction. The SPEED Act restores its proper function and will finally empower the people to build. The challenges we face demand that we act. It’s time to pass the SPEED Act and protect America’s future.

Leveraging methodologies and data from GTI Energy’s Reliable Affordable Infrastructure for Secure Energy initiative, the study will evaluate at least eight hydrogen production and delivery pathways, including blue and green hydrogen, and assess underground hydrogen storage opportunities to support long-duration, low carbon energy systems. The project will produce a regional hydrogen hub roadmap with technoeconomic, lifecycle emissions, and infrastructure analyses tailored to Southwest Virginia. GTI Energy is based out of Des Plaines, Illinois.

“Virginia is taking a systems-level approach to aligning hydrogen infrastructure with economic priorities, looking at what works, what scales, and what delivers real value,” said Paula Gant, President and CEO, GTI Energy. “Through VISION H2, we will build on the region’s natural gas infrastructure and operational expertise to progress energy system performance, improving reliability, accessibility, and resilience for energy users across Southwest Virginia.”

CCALS: Hydrogen-Hybrid Aviation and Use Cases

The Commonwealth Center for Advanced Logistics Systems (CCALS), based in Petersburg, will identify and build hydrogen and hydrogen hybrid use cases across Southwest Virginia, with a focus on aviation and aviation adjacent applications. Building on previously funded work and a new Energy Centric UAS Center for Critical Infrastructure, CCALS will extend demonstration, testing, and training activities to Lonesome Pine Airport in Wise County and other Southwest localities to create early hydrogen demand, workforce pathways, and supply-chain opportunities in unmanned aircraft systems and advanced air mobility. The project will survey regional industries, deploy minimally viable hydrogen hybrid infrastructure, and host training and demonstration events that connect hydrogen producers, distributors, and end users.

“This award empowers CCALS to pioneer hydrogen-hybrid aviation applications at Lonesome Pine Airport and across Southwest Virginia, forging demand-side markets, workforce pathways, and supply chains that propel the region’s hydrogen ecosystem forward,” said Karen R. Jackson, Senior Fellow, Commonwealth Center for Advanced Logistics Systems.

WireTough Cylinders: Hydrogen Storage Manufacturing Plan

WireTough Cylinders, LLC, based in Bristol, will develop its project titled “A Plan for Hydrogen Storage Manufacturing Made In and For Southwest Virginia and Beyond.” The project will evaluate the feasibility of establishing a manufacturing facility in Southwest Virginia to produce liner cylinders for WireTough’s patented Type II-S pressure vessels and also Type 1 cylinders ready for market, enabling bulk surface storage of hydrogen for regional production and end use applications. Over a 24-month period, WireTough will analyze storage needs, candidate sites in communities such as Bristol and surrounding counties, capital and workforce requirements, and economic impacts. This project will help position Southwest Virginia as a center of excellence for hydrogen storage technology and high-quality advanced manufacturing jobs.

“WireTough is proud to advance hydrogen storage manufacturing in Bristol and surrounding counties, creating high-paying jobs and establishing Southwest Virginia as a center of excellence for innovative, cost-effective bulk hydrogen vessels made right here at home,” said Richard Moore, Strategy and Business Development, WireTough Cylinders, LLC.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed yesterday to vacate and rehear a September panel ruling allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to freeze $20 billion in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants.

“Earlier in the year, EPA Administrator [Lee] Zeldin proudly terminated $20 billion in GGRF funding that was awarded to eight National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator entities as serious concerns were raised regarding self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and reduced government oversight,” an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “EPA looks forward to vindicating its rights in court.”

“A court just said the EPA must stop blocking the investments from our Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., posted on social media. “We created this program to support innovation that spurs good-paying jobs & lowers costs for Americans.”

Dive Insight:

Climate United received $6.97 billion in grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in April 2024.

The organization used the money to fund “projects across the United States that support domestic clean energy development, build healthy and affordable housing, accelerate American-made electric vehicle manufacturing, and save hard-working Americans money on their bills,” it said in a March 8 lawsuit filed after EPA froze the funding to it and other organizations on March 4.

The EPA stated that the grants were terminated “based on substantial concerns regarding the GGRF program integrity, the award process, wasteful spending, and misalignment with agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a preliminary injunction rejecting the EPA’s attempts to terminate the grant program on April 15.

EPA appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 in September that the district court lacked jurisdiction in the case. Climate United and a group of grantees filed an emergency appeal asking the full court to review that decision on Sept. 11.

WCNC Charlotte is part of the Charlotte Journalism Collaborative (CJC), launched by the Solutions Journalism Network with funding from the Knight Foundation.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — When scores of masked federal agents swarmed into Charlotte last month, veteran journalist Rafael Prieto was shocked by what he saw.

Armed men snatched immigrants from front yards, parking lots and work sites, pulled them from cars and threw some to the ground. Anxiety spiked for many of Mecklenburg County’s 175,000 Hispanic residents. Businesses closed. Students stayed home. People who needed medical help were afraid to get it.

Prieto, 71, a naturalized citizen from Colombia, did something he’d never done. “I carried my passport in my pocket for the first time ever,” he said. “These (agents) didn’t respect anyone or anything.”

“Operation Charlotte’s Web” disrupted lives and families and raised concerns throughout the community. It made national headlines. It’s just one of many Trump administration policies that have impacted people here.

Roughly a year into the second Trump administration, changes have frayed federal safety nets and upended practices once taken for granted. They’ve affected housing, health care, food security and education. New policies have impacted how people live and, in at least one case, where they live.

“We need to acknowledge the attack that we’re under and do what we can to support our nonprofit service providers, who are meeting increased need with fewer resources,” said Kathryn Firmin-Sellers, president and CEO of United Way of Greater Charlotte.

The effects aren’t hard to find. Mecklenburg County health officials had to lay off people working to slow the spread of HIV. Housing advocates are scrambling to ensure that people who get federal housing aid don’t lose it. Food banks are coping with the loss of one federal assistance program and cuts to another.

“Ultimately our super-hero cape is not big enough to shoulder the crisis that the federal government has created,” said Tina Postel, CEO of Nourish Up, a local food pantry.

Border Patrol officials said they went after “the worst of the worst,” though offered no proof for most of the more than 400 people detained in Mecklenburg. But the arrest last week by police of an undocumented immigrant for allegedly stabbing a light rail passenger reignited concerns among some – including President Donald Trump.

Some say the federal budget cuts reflect spending constraints as well as philosophical differences in the role of the federal government.

“It may just be a differing view of what the federal government should do going forward,” said Republican Tariq Bokhari, a former Charlotte City Council member who briefly served as deputy administrator of the Federal Transit Administration.

The cuts in federal spending have come at a time when some nonprofits have seen private philanthropic and charitable gifts decline. Tracy Russ, a senior vice president of the Foundation for the Carolinas, calls it a kind of “double whammy” that he expects to get worse.

“What I’m most fearful of is what these impacts look like a year or two from now,” he said.

For many service providers, the “double whammy” comes at a fraught time. With inflation up 25% since 2020, more families are squeezed.

“The need has never been greater in the 50-year history of Crisis Assistance Ministry,” said Carol Hardison, its longtime CEO.

New rules could displace hundreds in Mecklenburg County

Karen Pelletier, director of the county’s Housing Innovation & Stabilization Services, remembers how she felt when she saw November’s email from federal housing officials.

“Helpless and concerned,” she recalls.

The email confirmed that the federal government was making a major change in housing policy by essentially ending Housing First. That program is based on the notion that housing should be a prerequisite for people dealing with addictions or mental illness, not a reward for overcoming them. Advocates say it’s got a track record of success in getting people off the streets and under roofs.

“All the research will tell you that Housing First is the appropriate course of action,” said Firmin-Sellers. “The model is that you get people into Housing First and then you provide the wraparound supports to help them stay there.”

The new policy would enact work requirements and require – not just encourage – addiction or mental health treatment. Federal aid would be temporary and designed to help people transition to private housing. The New York Times called the policy shift “the most consequential in a generation.”

“That completely erases the 10 years of success that we’ve had in Housing First,” Pelletier said.

Devon Kurtz of the conservative Cicero Institute told the New York Times that, “Housing First simultaneously expected too much of people, by assuming everyone was ready for housing, and too little, in terms of the lack of expectations for sobriety and work.”

But nationwide, experts say the new approach could cost 170,000 people their homes, including many who are elderly or disabled. In Mecklenburg, Pelletier said 513 people currently live in so-called “permanent supportive housing.” She said the change could displace hundreds who’ve been stably housed for years.

“Without this assistance, many of them are going to end up back in our homeless system,” Pelletier said. In a community that already has more than 2,300 homeless people, what that means is unclear.

“We don’t have capacity in our shelter system,” Pelletier said.

A fraying public health safety net

Federal budget cuts. Vaccine skeptics. Looming Medicaid cuts. Rising health insurance costs. No single threat keeps Dr. Raynard Washington awake at night.

“They all keep you up,” said Washington, the county’s public health director.

He lost more than a dozen employees to budget cuts or program changes. That includes disease investigation specialists specializing in HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Though some jobs were restored, the interruption led to delays.

“The consequence of that is somebody else gets exposed to a disease,” Washington said.

Chelsea Gulden, executive director of RAIN, a nonprofit focused on HIV, told Qnotes that because of federal budget cuts, “we are poised to see numbers of HIV increase in a way we have not seen in years.”

Washington has seen evidence that more people appear to share Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s skepticism of vaccines. That includes public doubts about an early childhood vaccine that can prevent pertussis, or whooping cough. Washington said the number of pertussis cases, normally around two, jumped to 70 in the past year with outbreaks often concentrated.

Washington said there’s been a rise in the number of families seeking religious exemptions to school vaccine requirements. They “simply don’t know who to trust,” he said.

One out of three Mecklenburg residents – 416,000 – receive benefits from Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. County officials say as many as 31,000 could lose them under new federal work requirements. They say that could grow to more than 80,000 if North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion program ends.

The N.C. General Assembly has yet to act on that program, which serves more than 687,000 North Carolinians.

Then there’s the pending expiration of extended subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In Mecklenburg, that’s more than 135,000 people, according to Nicholas Riggs, director of the NC Navigator Consortium. He said premiums could soar.

Carolyn Willey of Indian Trail said her family of three has been paying around $400 a month under the ACA. Because her husband’s income as a general contractor rose to where they would lose their federal subsidy, they would now have to pay $1,200 a month for basic coverage.

“We were shocked to see it was going up that much,” Willey said.

Food assistance shrinks as need surges

On a sunny fall morning, Brittany Mays waited in her car outside an east Charlotte church that doubled as a mobile distribution site for Nourish Up. She’s a mother of four whose husband was laid off from a car dealership. They relied on SNAP – the federal emergency food program – until it was suspended during the 42-day government shutdown.

“With the change in income and not being able to afford the high price of groceries… it means a lot,” she said of the food donation.

The shutdown only exacerbated the challenge for Mecklenburg’s 137,000 SNAP recipients. Federal help has fallen sharply. Nourish Up, for example, has seen a 50% drop in help from the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Another program, which would have provided $11 million to food banks around the state, has ended.

This year Congress added work requirements to the SNAP program and shifted some costs to states and counties. Officials say the work requirements alone could result in 17,000 county residents losing benefits.

“What just baffles me beyond comprehension is the lack of compassion in all these policies for lower- and middle-income people,” said Tina Postel, Nourish Up’s CEO. “How much more cruel can you be to keep food off the plates of children and seniors on fixed income and hard working individuals who just aren’t making a livable wage?”

Policy shifts deepen fears in LGBTQ+ community

Annelise Mennicke has received a lot of research grants in her career, including from the National Institutes of Health. But she never lost one until this year.

Mennicke, who teaches in UNC Charlotte’s School of Social Work, had received a $450,000 grant from the NIH to help members of the LGBTQ+ community who became victims of sexual assault. Mennicke is research director for the university’s Violence Prevention Center.

In March she got a letter from the NIH. “This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” it read. “Research programs based on gender identity … do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.” Such studies, it added, ignore “biological realities.”

One of Trump’s first executive orders said, “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.”

Mennicke’s was one of 19 federally funded grants terminated at UNC Charlotte, according to school officials. Her grant was restored this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a mixed ruling in a case brought by the American Public Health Association.

But for Mennicke, “‘emotional roller coaster’ doesn’t begin to describe this experience.”

“I’ve been having panic attacks,” she said. “I’ve had trouble being present with my family. I’ve spiraled into existential crises around whether I can stay in academia, in North Carolina, or even in the United States. My grandmother fled Germany in 1939 to flee the Nazis … How did she know it was time to flee? How will I know?”

Amanda Dumas knew.

She was a Huntersville town commissioner until this fall when she and her 14-year-old transgender son moved to Canada. Like many members of the LGBTQ+ community and their families, she saw an increasingly threatening political environment. Then, she said, Atrium Health stopped offering gender affirming care this summer.

“That was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Dumas, who has dual citizenship. “There’s no reason for us to stay if we can no longer even access health care.”

DEI rollbacks reverberate through local institutions

On the day he took office, Trump signed an executive order calling Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs “illegal and immoral.”

“That ends today,” it said.

Ra’Shawn Flournoy, executive director of a health care center that caters to Black members of the LGBTQ+ community, has said DEI caused the center to lose a grant dealing with prevention of sexually transmitted infections.

“Our STI grant was cut,” he told Qnotes, “and because of the DEI mandate … the administration had actually even called us and said because we had language that had DEI in it, we had 48 hours to change it before we lost all of our funding.”

UNC Charlotte had already closed three DEI-related offices in 2024 to comply with system-wide UNC policies. Money and staff were reassigned to other programs.

This year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools lost about $6.8 million in grants to support teacher development and recruitment because they were perceived to foster DEI. Board Chair Stephanie Sneed said CMS still has to deal with the diversity of a district where 146 languages are spoken.

“Our district is majority-minority, and that demands that we lead with intentionality,” she said. “Programs that support multilingual learners, cultural diversity, and student-specific needs are not optional – they are essential to ensuring every child has access to rigorous instruction and real opportunity.”

Sneed said her more immediate concern is the well-being of the system’s 44,000 Hispanic students. With federal agents in town, some kids went to school with handwritten notes attached to their book bags saying, “I am a citizen.”

“It is the emotional impact that this has had on our families, which affects the ability to learn,” Sneed said. As many as 30,000 students missed school on one day during the crackdown. Sneed worries that they might not have had the breakfast or lunch they can get at school.

“It’s a cascading impact,” she said. “It contributes to our children being successful in our school district.”

Funding cuts undermine Charlotte's mobility gains

Opportunity – or the lack of it – was the theme of a 2014 study by Harvard researcher Raj Chetty. It ranked Charlotte and its surrounding area last among 50 U.S. cities in upward mobility. It was a wake-up call that prompted a concerted community effort to improve. The Charlotte area rose to 38th in last year’s Chetty rating.

Tonya Jameson, director of Civic Advancement for Leading on Opportunity, a nonprofit created to foster mobility, said the federal cuts don’t help.

“If a mother or father can’t feed their family, how can we expect them to be able to go to work and advance economically?” she said. “Now you’re forced to just be in survival mode.”

A survey of around 200 nonprofits by UNC Charlotte’s Urban Institute for the Foundation for the Carolinas and United Way of Greater Charlotte found that 30% reported cuts in public funding this year. Forty-seven percent reported losses from other sources.

The survey found that while most reported greater need for services and resources, 31% were serving fewer clients. “A growing barrier to community access of (nonprofit) services and resources was fear, particularly among marginalized communities,” the survey found. The full report has yet to be released.

“The threats are not just the federal budget cuts but … people aren’t giving as much generally,” said Tracy Russ of the Foundation for the Carolinas.

Ivan Canada, president and CEO of the N.C. Center for Nonprofits, said individual giving to many of the state’s 14,000 nonprofits has declined since Covid. One reason is that with higher standard tax deductions, there’s less incentive for some to give.

By some measures Americans are still generous. Giving by individuals, philanthropies and corporations rose to $592 billion in 2024, up 6.3% from the year before, according to Giving USA. But there are warning signs.

“There’s been a decline in trust in institutions in general and also with nonprofits,” said Michael Thatcher, CEO of Charity Navigator, a national ratings agency. “For the first time ever in 2024 the trust in nonprofits dropped below that of for-profit institutions. That’s new.”

It’s not just local funding cuts that affect Mecklenburg.

The end of solar tax credits could cost jobs in Mecklenburg’s clean energy industry, said Zach Amittay of E2, an advocacy group. It says the county has nearly 20,000 clean energy jobs.

And Internal Revenue Service cuts could cause delays in the free tax preparation services offered by the Davidson-based Ada Jenkins Center. Marsha Clark, director of the center’s asset building program, expects to help 3,200 clients next year.

“The bottom line is slowdowns,” she said.

Despite challenges, Charlotte's resilience endures

In late November, Manolo Betancur, whose Central Avenue bakery became an unofficial center for protests during the immigration crackdown, spoke at Myers Park Baptist Church.

“We used to feel alone,” he said. “I never thought we’d see this army of friends.”

During the crackdown people with camera phones videoed agents making arrests. Parents showed up at school parking lots to ensure students were safe. Churches and volunteers across the city collected and delivered food to families holed up at home. Students at several high schools walked out to protest the federal action.

“Allies are learning how to help their neighbors,” Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, told the Guardian newspaper. “(W)here this administration is trying to sow division, we see an organic movement of community members trying to provide support and assistance.”

Like the volunteers, people in the business of helping others believe Charlotte is a resilient community. Nonprofits coping with reduced budgets and other challenges have been working together.

In September, representatives from groups that included many non-profits packed a room in the Government Center. They shared their challenges and talked about ways to deal with them. They know, as Firmin-Sellers said, “There is no amount of philanthropy that can fill the gap that is being created.”

“We’re a tough bunch,” Firmin-Sellers said. “And we’re an optimistic bunch (or) we wouldn’t be doing this. “And so in spite of all the challenges, I think leaders are more engaged and more determined to continue to do as much good as we can with what we’ve got.

“The nonprofit leaders in this community continue to inspire me. And they should inspire us all.”

A new report from the UK-based nonprofit organization Centre for Net Zero, to which RMI contributed, considers the next phase of the global electric vehicle (EV) transition: mass adoption. This phase comes after years of targeted policy support, falling battery costs, and expanding global supply chains. It represents the steep part of the “S-curve” of technology adoption and is characterized by rapid cost reductions, improvements in quality, and stiffening competition.

Exhibit 1. EVs on the Technology S-Curve

This step involves overcoming challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with a rapidly scaling industry as well as the requirements for infrastructure integration. Three clear goals stand out: ensuring the transition is rapid, that it is equitable, and that it is systemically integrated with clean energy networks.

EV policy today, and what comes next

One in five new cars sold worldwide is already electric, and even though the US market is facing headwinds, global sales are continuing to accelerate rapidly. But this momentum is not enough to secure a cleaner transportation future. As with the rise of the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, which was supported by massive investment in roads, highways, and shifting city planning and zoning policies, today’s transition is driven by policy and technology. Without decisive policy, investment, and coordination, feedback loops could slow or reverse, lock in fossil fuel dependency for longer, or result in the build-out of supply chain, energy, and other infrastructure that is either too slow or not fit-for-purpose. Policy consistency is key to boosting market competitiveness and encouraging consumer confidence.

This article highlights four actions that can form the basis for a new strategy for the next phase of rapid growth:

Close the purchase price gap

Expand access to affordable charging

Prepare the electricity grid

Invest in circular and efficient manufacturing

Close the purchase price gap

In terms of new vehicles, EVs offer lower running costs than ICE vehicles, but this advantage is partially offset by higher upfront costs. 2024 saw global battery pack prices fall by 20 percent even as average size increased, but this hasn’t fully translated to lower retail prices for consumers. In China, a 30 percent fall in battery prices translated into a 10 percent decline in electric SUV prices; in Germany, EV retail prices rose slightly despite a 20 percent battery cost drop.

We expect costs to continue falling due to fundamental dynamics such as technological learning and economies, but subsidies and tax incentives can also play a role in closing the gap sooner. Policymakers will increasingly need to consider more targeted support for those who need it most. Examples of innovative financing models that can broaden access include blended finance models, ‘pay-as-you-drive’ schemes, flexible leasing, green bonds and concessional loans, and battery-as-a-service offerings.

Expand access to affordable charging

Without a reliable, accessible, and affordable public charging network, EVs cannot scale. Public charging is consistently cited as a key barrier, particularly among marginal adopters who prioritize convenience, accessibility, and range confidence. Survey data confirms that purchase intent rises sharply when public charging is perceived to match the ease of refueling an ICE vehicle.

Public charging is significantly more expensive than home charging — up to 10 times so in some countries. Yet, as EVs go mainstream, those dependent on the public charging network will form a growing share of users. For example, in Los Angeles, analysis by NREL finds that, by 2035, public charging could cost an additional $300/year for the 20 percent of households who will lack at-home charging access. Parallel efforts on expanding access to home charging and increasing the affordability of public charging are needed.

Smart public charging — matching demand with cheaper electricity supply — can also help close the affordability gap by delivering cheap off-peak charging to households, as it does in domestic settings.

Centre for Net Zero’s research shows that dynamic pricing can encourage drivers charging outside of their homes to do so when electricity costs are cheaper, reducing EV running costs below those of petrol cars. Lower-income areas showed the strongest behavioral response, indicating that they may stand to gain the most.

Prepare the electricity grid

The need to expand and reinforce grid capacity is well understood. But simply building up the grid is not enough. Existing approaches to utility planning are creating bottlenecks for charging infrastructure expansion. A modern, EV-ready connection regime must prioritize speed, transparency, and flexibility for vehicles of all sizes.

On the supply side:

Current regulatory models, based on cost prudence and recovery, often cause investment timelines for grid upgrades to be mismatched with the needs of EV charging installations. While EV charging sites can usually be built in less than six months, distribution system upgrades can take two to five years.

Better forecasting, guided by tools such as RMI’s GridUp, can help grid planning shift from reactive to proactive. Anticipatory investment in grid upgrades, reforms to connection processes, and increased utilization of grid flexibility are all solutions that can help the grid better meet EV charging demand.

Flexible service connections can allow charging sites to make more efficient use of existing grid infrastructure. By working with the capacity that is typically available outside of a few peak hours of the year, these alternatives can power charging a majority of the time without creating a need for more investment in the grid. This allows charging to become available faster at less cost to the utility.

On the demand side:

If left unmanaged, widespread charging will exacerbate existing grid constraints, leading to instability, rising infrastructure costs, and higher bills for consumers.

Managed charging will be a key solution. RMI analysis shows that managed charging could reduce EV charging contribution to peak demand by nearly a third in New York State. EVs could also absorb surplus renewable energy and ease congestion, ultimately lowering system costs. Similarly, Centre for Net Zero analysis shows managed charging at home can shift the entirety of EV demand to low-cost, low-emission off-peak periods. Where dynamic pricing exists, these cost savings can be passed through to consumers — around £650 for UK customers compared to flat-rate tariffs.

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology — which allows consumers to export electricity back to the grid from their EVs — could provide even more of the same system benefits but will require bi-directional capability. In the UK, Center for Net Zero finds that widespread V2G adoption could absorb larger volumes of variable renewable generation, leading to a reduction in average wholesale electricity prices of up to 10 percent by 2030.

Invest in circular and efficient manufacturing

EVs already have a structural advantage over ICE vehicles: while both require material inputs, EVs rely on a one-time extraction of battery minerals, whereas ICE vehicles lock in a perpetual dependence on fossil extraction.

Nonetheless, the rising demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel raises legitimate sustainability concerns. One answer is battery recycling, which is already advancing rapidly: In 2019, 59 percent of lithium-ion batteries were recycled globally, and estimates now suggest this figure could be approaching 90 percent. Modern processes can recover from 80 to 95 percent of minerals, and this is expected to rise to 95–99 percent within a decade. Announced recycling capacity is already sufficient to manage all end-of-life batteries through 2030.

Exhibit 5. Total battery mineral ore needed to sustain EVs vs. oil extracted each year for non-electric vehicles

The need for critical minerals, and even new battery recycling capacity, can also be reduced by improving vehicle efficiency. This can be achieved in several ways, including improved aerodynamics, the use of lighter materials, and vehicle size. Smaller EVs require smaller batteries — which have the added benefit of lower costs. For example, the already heavyweight GMC Hummer EV requires a 246 kWh battery that weighs as much as a sedan itself, while the compact Chevrolet Bolt EV only needs a 66 kWh battery. Unfortunately, efficiency is not always top of consumer minds: demand for ever bigger cars continues to rise.

The goal is no longer simply more EVs, but smarter, fairer, and more sustainable deployment — ensuring that EVs work with, not against, the systems they depend on. The four actions above are not comprehensive but represent the priority areas where stakeholders should seek to align as EVs enter this critical next stage. Getting this right will make the difference for a healthy environment, stronger economy, and a sustainably sourced future for cars.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1393199281.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:59:56.488336

Trump Media & Technology Group, the company which owns the US president's social media platform Truth Social, has bought a fusion power company for $US6 billion ($9 billion).

Fusion energy, which is different from nuclear energy, has long been hoped to generate vast amounts of energy with little danger but has so far not been commercially viable.

The unusual tie-up comes as the Trump administration pushes power-hungry AI technology that will require a massive build-out of energy sources.

Trump Media & Technology Group, the struggling company that owns the US president's Truth Social platform, has announced a $US6 billion ($9 billion) merger with fusion power company TAE Technologies, in an unexpected pivot into energy technology.

The all-stock transaction will see shareholders of each company hold approximately 50 per cent of the combined entity, which plans to begin construction of what it calls the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026.

Trump Media's share price has slumped by about 70 per cent in the past year but was up nearly 25 per cent after the announcement.

Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican legislator, said the deal represents ""a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations.""

Fusion power plants would generate electricity through the same process that powers the Sun, a goal long pursued by researchers, though no commercially viable project has yet been built despite decades of research.

The unusual tie-up comes as the Trump administration pushes power-hungry AI technology that will require a massive build-out of energy sources.

AI data centres are posing an increasing burden on US power grids, and the White House is encouraging the fast-tracking of energy projects to meet demand.

Trump Media generates only $US1.7m in revenue

TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, says its fusion technology could provide abundant electricity to power AI infrastructure.

The California-based company has built five fusion reactors and employs over 400 people, including 62 Ph.D. holders, a statement said.

The company has raised more than $US1.3 billion from investors including Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs. Trump Media has agreed to provide up to $US300 million in cash to TAE.

Trump Media has launched several projects in recent months, including cryptocurrency-related financial products and a video streaming platform, but generated only $US1.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2025.

Mr Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company, while Michael Schwab of Big Sky Partners is expected to chair a nine-member board that will include Donald Trump Jr., the president's son.

The transaction requires shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to close by mid-2026.

Charlotte, NC — December 18, 2025 — Today, free tech-training program Per Scholas North Carolina and The BlackRock Foundation celebrated a major milestone: 339 North Carolinians trained in less than one year through their IT workforce training initiative. New data shows graduates are earning, on average, 2.6 times their pre-program income, representing an estimated $100 million in lifetime earnings uplift.

Earlier this year, The BlackRock Foundation committed $1 million to Per Scholas North Carolina to expand access to high-quality tech training and prepare more North Carolinians for in-demand jobs. Less than a year into the partnership, the initiative is well on track to meet its two-year goal of training 530 learners, with graduates earning industry-recognized credentials and already securing in-demand jobs across the technology sector including Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Data Analytics.

The program is reaching those who stand to benefit most: 38% of graduates hold only a high school diploma, and 42% are parents with children under 18. The resulting estimated income gains are helping families build long-term financial stability.

“As a proud North Carolina resident, I’m thrilled to see The BlackRock Foundation partnering with Per Scholas to expand opportunity in the community,” said Carrie Schroen, a BlackRock Managing Director. “Helping more people experience financial well-being – including building the foundation for a secure retirement – is central to BlackRock’s purpose. We’re honored to invest in the region’s future. These students are not only building careers, they’re paving the way toward lasting financial security and I’m excited to see the impact they will make in our communities.”

One of today’s graduates, Tim Kinsey, enrolled in Per Scholas Western North Carolina’s IT Support course in June 2025 while he was juggling a series of hourly service jobs and earning below the region’s basic living-wage thresholds. Today, he graduated and has already secured a full-time Computer Support Technician I role with Henderson County, earning an annual salary nearly double his previous income and beginning a stable career track rarely accessible in rural counties without formal tech training.

“Before Per Scholas, I was piecing together several jobs just to get by,” said Tim Kinsey, Per Scholas North Carolina Graduate. “Now I’m stepping into a career with real growth, benefits, and the chance to build a future for my family — all while staying in the community I love.”

The program’s impact is especially significant in Western NC, where typical entry-level wages are $15–$17 per hour. Launched in partnership with Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College after Hurricane Helene, Per Scholas Western NC is creating pathways into resilient, higher-wage tech careers and is on track to train 100 rural learners by 2026.

“We’re just getting started in rural North Carolina, and the results already speak for themselves. When learners double or even triple their income, that’s not only life-changing for their families — it strengthens entire communities,” stated Per Scholas North Carolina Senior Managing Director Mike Terrell. “These are dollars that stay local, support small businesses, and help rural economies grow. Thanks to The BlackRock Foundation’s grant we’re proving what’s possible when talent meets opportunity.”

In North Carolina—where BlackRock has invested over $100 billion in NC-based public companies on behalf of clients—the BlackRock Foundation is partnering with Per Scholas to fuel greater economic opportunity. Through the firm’s investments on behalf of clients and The Foundation’s philanthropic support, BlackRock is supporting North Carolina families in taking steps to secure their financial futures.

“Tim’s story exemplifies the mission of The BlackRock Foundation,” said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. “By ensuring people have the skills for in-demand jobs, Per Scholas is helping more North Carolinians get on the path to thriving wage careers in their own communities so they can support their families and build financial security.”

Today’s ceremony in Uptown Charlotte celebrated graduates’ achievements and featured remarks from Per Scholas alumni living in Charlotte and Western North Carolina, and from BlackRock Managing Director, Carrie Schroen.

Per Scholas also announced the launch of its third cohort in January, continuing its momentum and opening doors for even more North Carolinians in 2026. To register for the next cohort, check out the Per Scholas North Carolina registration page: https://perscholas.org/locations/northcarolina/.

Since launching in 2020, Per Scholas North Carolina has trained more than 1,000 learners, equipping them with critical tech skills such as Cybersecurity, End User Support and Salesforce Administrator. Alumni have earned jobs at employers including Capgemini, Humana, and Wells Fargo.

By Sheila Kennedy

December 18, 2025

Heather Cox Richardson recently explored the success of Trump’s “sales pitch,” which she attributed to his ability to leverage a belief in the victimization of White folks that Republicans have increasingly embraced since the 1980s. As she put it, the message boiled down to “the reason certain white Americans were being left behind in the modern world was not that Republican policies had transferred more than $50 trillion from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%, but that lazy and undeserving Black and Brown Americans and women were taking handouts from the government rather than working.”

I think this is exactly right.

After all, as a man and a candidate, Trump is repulsive. His “policies” are laughable when they aren’t appalling, raising the question why anyone would support him. Political scholarship has answered that question by linking his ability to generate votes to “racial resentment,” and that link becomes more obvious every time he talks about “shithole” countries, calls Black immigrants “garbage,” or attacks “woke-ism” or DEI. But it isn’t just race–Trump and MAGA have built their appeal on resentment of every American who isn’t a White Christian male: the “uppity” women who’ve forgotten their proper role, the LGBTQ+ folks who had the nerve to open the closet door, Jews and Muslims. Etc.

The base of the appeal, as the Richardson quote suggests, is the festering anger of victimhood. There are thousands of White “Christian” nationalists whose lives haven’t gone the way they wanted or intended. Perhaps it’s that they haven’t accumulated the wealth they once thought they’d enjoy, or generated the admiration or applause or familial love to which they felt entitled. Perhaps they’re among the self-described Incels.

We have all encountered people nursing these grievances. Sometimes, their complaints are very understandable; other times, disconnected from their public-facing financial or social positions. Whatever these White “Christian” men feel is missing, whatever the nature of the deeply-felt disappointment, their lives aren’t providing something to which they feel entitled. Not only do they resent the fact that their lives have failed to meet their expectations, they need to believe that–whatever it is–it simply cannot be their own fault.

They need to see themselves as victims.",https://indianacitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/resized.sheila_kennedy.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:01:13.187088

The decision would allow Sugar Camp Mine to mine over 20,000 acres of TVA-owned coal now, and allow TVA to privatize the entire 60,000 acres of underground federal coal reserves in Franklin, Hamilton, and Jefferson counties.
“Mining at this site has wreaked havoc on the lives of Southern Illinois residents for years,” said Amanda Pankau, Director of Energy and Community Resiliency at Prairie Rivers Network.
“Illinois is making bold progress on the climate crisis, and is creating thousands of good jobs building clean energy to replace coal in our power supply,” said Jack Darin, Director of the Sierra Club, Illinois Chapter.

The decision would allow Sugar Camp Mine to mine over 20,000 acres of TVA-owned coal now, and allow TVA to privatize the entire 60,000 acres of underground federal coal reserves in Franklin, Hamilton, and Jefferson counties. The Trump administration’s promises to resurrect coal largely ignore the economic realities of the industry’s decades-long decline, however the administration's efforts are already harming the health and safety of miners and leading to more air and water pollution.

The current mine operators and their parent company, Foresight, have a long history of noncompliance with mining and worker safety protections, including negligence leading to miner deaths and numerous water quality violations from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Specifically, the operator misused toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) firefighting foam in an attempt to put out a mine fire, and they criminally failed to notify workers working in the mine while the fire burned.

“Mining at this site has wreaked havoc on the lives of Southern Illinois residents for years,” said Amanda Pankau, Director of Energy and Community Resiliency at Prairie Rivers Network. “Not only do mining discharges threaten their ability to enjoy Illinois' beautiful natural spaces, but residents have also experienced damage to their homes and properties, faced exposure to harmful chemicals like PFAS, and worry every day about potential impacts to their own health.”

The TVA proposal would significantly increase the state’s climate and health harming coal extraction at a time when Illinois is taking nation-leading action to reduce its carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.

“Illinois is making bold progress on the climate crisis, and is creating thousands of good jobs building clean energy to replace coal in our power supply,” said Jack Darin, Director of the Sierra Club, Illinois Chapter. “We cannot let the federal government take us backward with a massive expansion of coal mining, especially at a site where the operator is already in flagrant violation of environmental laws and guilty of polluting the groundwater with forever toxins.”

The complaint was filed in federal court for the Southern District of Illinois. Prairie Rivers Network is represented in the matter by Rob Weinstock of the Northwestern Environmental Advocacy Center, and Sierra Club Illinois is represented by Albert Ettinger.

“TVA’s actions are unlawful, arbitrary, and irresponsible. Its choices fail the standards set by Congress in the National Environmental Policy Act and Administrative Procedures Act and are set to devastate rural communities and ecosystems.” said Robert Weinstock of the Northwestern Environmental Advocacy Center.

“TVA’s decision to allow the mining and burning of this coal will contribute substantially to flooding, extreme weather, extinction of wildlife, and other known effects of climate change,” Pankau said. “The people of Southern Illinois deserve better.”

The move, revealed the same week a new EV alliance with Renault was announced in Europe and the EU Commission back-tracked on a 2035 ICE ban, is being made in a bid to stem haemorrhaging losses triggered by slowing demand for electric cars globally.

Instead, the F-150 Lightning nameplate will live on and be used for an all-new range-extender hybrid (EREV) version of its full-size F-150 ute.

The new F-150 Lightning EREV will be built at Ford’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, on the same production line as the outgoing truck.

Combining a petrol engine that acts as a generator with an all-electric powertrain, Ford claims the new F-150 Hybrid can drive more than 700 miles (1126km) with a full tank of fuel and topped-up battery.

As well as the all-electric F-150 Lightning replacement, Ford has also admitted its electric replacement for the E-Transit van due in 2028 has been put on ice.

Work is already underway to re-engineer it for petrol and hybrid power.

One EV Ford is racing to launch is the small mid-size Ranchero. The Ranger-sized all-electric ute set to be the first of a new family of affordable EVs based on Ford’s new low-cost universal EV platform.

The same architecture is allegedly destined by 2030 to underpin as much as half of all Fords sold globally.

Helping boost its appeal, when it lands in early 2027, the new Ranchero will “cater to customers who want more for their money – more range, more utility, [and] more usability”.

Back in Australia, Ford still struggles to sell EVs, with volumes of the Mustang Mach-E having fallen by 31.9 per cent to just 435.

It is currently outsold by the Toyota bZ4X three-to-one.

Meanwhile, the battery-electric E-Transit is said to only account for seven per cent of total Transit sales.

From now on Ford said it would focus its resources on rolling out smaller more affordable EVs all built on the new Universal EV platform.

Finally, to fulfil its 2030 ambitions that more than 50 per cent of all vehicles sold will either an EV, hybrid or range-extender hybrid, Ford says it will launch a new hybrid version of every current series models it makes.

As well as F-150 Lightning EREV, Ford will also introduce a Bronco EREV that should offer a larger all-electric range with near unmatched off-road capability.

The Safest “Asymmetric Bet” in Advanced Energy

Backed by global leaders such as Google and Chevron, as well as multiple Nobel laureates, TAE’s unique approach to fusion has been technically validated through milestones, including the achievement of extreme plasma temperatures. Unlike other ventures, TAE’s strategy offers two paths to success: its premium, advanced fuel source or a robust “tritium parachute” that still provides a projected 100 times economic advantage over mainstream rivals. This revolutionary dual-path strategy dramatically reduces the capital investment risk, offering a high-reward future with a solid safety net, and placing TAE on a plausible roadmap for commercial energy deployment in the early to mid-2030s.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this home construction supplier have returned +12.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Building Products - Wood industry, to which Louisiana-Pacific belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Louisiana-Pacific is expected to post earnings of $0.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -94.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.

Although it did not entirely reject clean energy policies or projects, it set a clear tone for energy policy in 2025: Clean energy would sink or swim on its own merits, while hydrocarbons would receive more support for geostrategic reasons.
Expansion of Offshore Energy Exploration A notable resurgence of offshore oil and gas exploration and leasing occurred in 2025.
5: The Nuclear Renaissance Needs More Research and Innovation Nuclear energy also received renewed attention in 2025, as policymakers have reconsidered its role in supporting reliable energy and building grid reliability.
Assuming ample battery and hydraulic storage can be provided, these clean energy sources are part of the future energy mix.","As 2025 draws to a close, the Trump White House, Department of Energy, Department of Interior, the EPA, and numerous other federal agencies involved in regulating energy and the environment have shifted away from the Biden Administration’s emphasis on “green transitions” and expensive renewables, and towards an approach that prioritizes conventional energy sources and energy security. The climate change assumptions of the Obama-Biden era that guided U.S. energy policy since 2008 are no longer influential. Today, energy security is paramount, and economic efficiency takes precedence over other concerns, with federal efforts to decarbonize and move toward a clean energy economy being replaced by initiatives that expand oil and gas production and accelerate the development of traditional energy sources — hydrocarbons and nuclear.

Beyond its domestic priorities, Washington has highlighted reliance on and export of energy as a tool of geopolitical leverage and influence. Collectively, these policy shifts demonstrate how Trump II is shaping the current U.S. energy landscape. Entering 2026 and the remainder of Trump’s term, key questions remain regarding the strategies and other provisions the administration will enact, as well as how it will further enforce this energy reorientation. While hydrocarbon production and sales are ramping up (particularly LNG), America needs to up its game to catch up to China in the nuclear arena. The U.S. should also not rule out renewables if, when, and where they make sense, as capital markets demonstrated enthusiasm about the renewables.

1: A National Energy Emergency

One of the earliest policy initiatives of this year was the January 20th declaration of a National Energy Emergency. Issued the day of President Trump’s inauguration, this Executive Order directed a strong focus on hydrocarbons to increase energy and infrastructure development. Citing the National Emergencies Act and stressing the need to expand domestic energy sources and wean the nation off reliance on foreign energy imports, Trump urged the Federal government to prioritize the development of the nation's fossil fuels and nuclear energy infrastructure.

The “Unleashing American Energy” directives, also announced immediately following the inauguration, directed a broader, national-scale approach to fossil fuel development as a companion piece to the National Energy Emergency declaration. Although it did not entirely reject clean energy policies or projects, it set a clear tone for energy policy in 2025: Clean energy would sink or swim on its own merits, while hydrocarbons would receive more support for geostrategic reasons. So far, the markets are more enthusiastic about renewables than about fossil fuels.

2: Redirection of Renewable Energy and EV Incentives

Before the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill, tax incentives under the Biden Administration supported the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy technology. This year, the credits and incentives for EVs and clean-energy charging stations were eliminated as of September 30th. Rescaling, restructuring, or a complete lapse of clean energy credits and programs has occurred. Such incentives are not central to the current administration’s energy strategy.

MORE FOR YOU

On a broader scale, government support for clean energy projects, including the development of wind and solar infrastructure, has also declined. Licensing for conventional energy development projects has not slowed, but permits for renewable energy projects have been stalled, many awaiting federal action and approval in 2025. Without subsidies or tax credits, some of these projects will likely incur negative ROI, while others will remain profitable, as the companies’ market performance suggests. The federal focus on financial incentives for individuals and corporations has shifted to those that support market-driven and conventional energy approaches.

3: U.S. Expansion of Offshore Energy Exploration

A notable resurgence of offshore oil and gas exploration and leasing occurred in 2025. In November, the Department of the Interior launched an “expansive” 11th national offshore leasing program, “Unleashing American Offshore Energy,” under an Order from Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum that terminates the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program established under the Biden Administration. This program plans for as many as 34 potential offshore lease sales across multiple U.S. regions.

Late this year, leasing got underway. In 2023, a sale of federal Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico) oil and gas leases became the subject of a court battle, with the Biden Administration and environmental groups claiming concerns about the endangered Rice’s Whale, on the one hand, and oil and gas companies as well as legislators from energy-producing states, citing the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, on the other. This December, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held its first major offshore lease sale since then, offering tens of millions of acres in the Gulf of America.

These developments reflect the broader push by the Trump Administration to increase fossil fuel production and expand offshore energy exploration after years in which offshore expansion had de facto been rendered taboo. Major oil companies such as BP and Chevron participated in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s December bidding process. They will likely be part of this attempt to increase U.S. energy production in the Gulf of America and other areas.

4: U.S. LNG Exports Surge on Global Markets

One of the most pronounced effects of the Trump administration's shift in energy policy has been the growth of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. American developers signed a series of sales and purchase agreements that significantly increased U.S. LNG’s impact in global markets. The growing demand for U.S. LNG broke the $5/mmbtu threshold for future shipments in December, which had not been reached in several years. Part of this expansion stems from the immediate lifting of restrictions imposed by the Biden administration to permit trade, including countries without a free trade agreement with the U.S.

There has been considerable growth in demand in European markets, driven by limited gas supply and storage from Europe’s traditional supplier, Russia, as the Russia-Ukraine war drags on. According to the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, in 2025 “…LNG imports surpassed pipeline gas imports in the EU for the first time. During this period, U.S. LNG accounted for 28% of total EU gas imports and 55% of LNG imports, on track to reach record levels by the end of 2025.” As these energy constraints from Russia endure, reducing supply to Europe, demand for U.S. LNG in European markets is expected to grow. Whatever qualms the Europeans may have about Trump, they have far greater reservations about Putin and Russian aggression.

5: The Nuclear Renaissance Needs More Research and Innovation

Nuclear energy also received renewed attention in 2025, as policymakers have reconsidered its role in supporting reliable energy and building grid reliability. As a result, Executive Orders were issued in May to remove regulatory barriers established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that have stalled U.S. nuclear energy expansion and to advance atomic power research. However, nuclear power development depends on economics, financing, proven technology breakthroughs (especially in the Small Modular Reactor industry), and a benign regulatory climate that eschews the “Not in My Back Yard” approach of many American states.

Moving Forward

Under Trump, the U.S. increased energy production and sought to make its industry more competitive with those of all other G-7 members. The U.S. and China supply energy at approximately 8c/kWh for industrial consumers. Europe is lagging, with costs for industrial consumers roughly twice as high. However, the U.S. is falling behind China, which has 32 nuclear reactors approved for construction, while the U.S. has only two.

With AI and data center expansion, transportation electrification, and population growth in the country’s south, the U.S. needs to secure ample and affordable electricity with a minimal carbon footprint. While the American shale oil and natural gas supply remains safe and secure, at least until 2028, the time has come for a major redesign and push for a reliable, safe, and affordable nuclear reactor fleet made in the U.S.A.

Additionally, America should not dismiss solar, wind, and other renewables, such as geothermal, when they make economic sense. Assuming ample battery and hydraulic storage can be provided, these clean energy sources are part of the future energy mix. For now, China leads the clean energy industries, from PV panels to storage batteries. It is time to engage in full-bore competition to further America’s energy dominance.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/694309c287ea3cbc42ca8a05/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:57.926932

Arkansas Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Under Act 485 of 2023, Arkansas is phasing out its throwback rule in an attempt to encourage investment in Arkansas by multistate enterprises.

The bill also establishes a $500 income tax credit for any taxpayer who owns a state-licensed “family childcare home."" If the credit exceeds the eligible taxpayer’s income tax liability in a given taxable year, the excess amount is treated as an overpayment and is to be refunded without interest.

HB7287 extends the 10 percent corporation business tax surcharge (which increases the corporate income tax rate) for an additional three years, to the 2026 through 2028 tax years. However, under the act, the surcharge that applies to the capital base (capital stock) tax component of the corporation business tax applies only for the 2026 and 2027 tax years because that component is scheduled to be eliminated starting in 2028.

Credits can be applied to corporate income, insurance premiums, or beverage taxes.

HB7031 also amended the definition of “corporation” so that charitable trusts are no longer treated as taxable corporations for Florida corporate income tax purposes.

Additionally, under HB7031, jet fuel, undyed kerosene, and aviation fuel will no longer be subject to the tax of 4.27 cents per gallon.

New language in HB7031 treats certain leased flight simulation training devices used in pilot training (where a government entity ultimately becomes the owner under the lease/contract) as exempt from ad valorem taxation.

Indiana Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Iowa Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

SF605 provides that winnings from sports wagering are considered earned income. The bill requires the withholding of state income tax from such winnings by payors if federal income tax withholding is also required under the Internal Revenue Code.

Michigan Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

On October 7, 2025, Michigan’s fiscal year 2025-2026 budget bill, HB4961, was signed into law. The finalized budget decouples from several provisions of the OBBBA to which Michigan had previously been conformed, including § 168(n), § 174, and § 179.

Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., full expensing), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and disco will continue to phase out over the following two years, meaning only 20 percent bonus depreciation is available for 2026 machinery and equipment purchases, and no bonus depreciation is available in 2027 and thereafter.

The bill also creates temporary state income tax deductions from Michigan's 4.25 percent personal income tax rate for tipped income and overtime pay for tax years 2026 through 2028.

Additionally, HB4961 reverses the requirement to offset the standard deductionThe standard deduction reduces a taxpayer’s taxable income by a set amount determined by the government.

Whether families face massive premium increases in 2026 depends on Senate action.","More than 20 million Americans with marketplace coverage are approaching an affordability cliff. The expiration of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits on December 31, 2025, will cause average premium costs to more than double in 2026.

After months of congressional Republican obstruction, a discharge petition will now force the House to vote on a clean, three-year extension of the enhanced premium tax credits in January. That vote creates a clear path forward to preserving affordability. However, preventing massive premium increases in 2026 will ultimately depend on whether the Senate acts to protect families from higher health insurance costs.

A new analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund finds that 2026 ACA health insurance marketplace premium costs will increase by thousands of dollars in 13 states where Republican senators could face accountability from voters, are retiring, or may otherwise be persuadable.

A hypothetical family of four (40- and 38-year-old parents of two children, ages 14 and 12) with an annual income of $161,000 in Anchorage, Alaska, would pay more than $25,100 in annual additional premium costs if the tax credits expire.

The financial strain would extend to single-parent households as well. A 55-year-old parent with an 18-year-old earning $85,000 annually in Portland, Maine, would face a $12,700 increase in annual premiums.

Young adults would also see higher costs. In Huntsville, Alabama, a 27-year-old earning $63,000 annually would need to pay an additional $1,365 to keep their marketplace coverage.

Older adults would face the steepest increases. For instance, in Charleston, West Virginia, premiums for a 62-year-old couple making $85,000 could surge by nearly $52,000.

Conclusion

The House vote is now unavoidable. Whether families face massive premium increases in 2026 depends on Senate action.

The National Petroleum Council’s (“NPC”) Committee on Oil and Natural Gas Infrastructure Permitting issued a December 3rd draft report titled:

Bottleneck to Breakthrough: A Permitting Blueprint to Build (“Report”).

NPC describes the Report as providing:

… practical solutions to modernize permitting and catalyze investment in America’s energy infrastructure.

The Report was prepared at the request of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright asking that the NPC undertake a Future Energy Systems study to provide advice on ensuring the availability of affordable, reliable, and secure energy for American consumers and allies. The request is stated to have specifically called for the delivery of a short-term study on streamlining and expediting oil and natural gas infrastructure permitting to meet future energy needs.

What are described as “focal points” of the permitting study include:

Recent major economic and geopolitical developments affecting energy delivery and demand.

Inefficiencies experienced under existing permitting laws, processes, and coordination efforts.

Administrative and legislative reforms to accelerate approvals without compromising environmental protections.

What are described as systemic permitting barriers delaying timely approvals and hindering efficient construction of energy infrastructure are stated to include:

Lengthy, fragmented reviews.

Litigation-driven delays.

Regulatory inconsistency.

Capacity shortfalls.

Infrastructure bottlenecks.

By way of summary of conclusions, the Report proposes what is described as a “two-pronged approach” that includes:

Immediate reforms to streamline existing processes, referencing clarification of National Environmental Policy Act reviews and reducing procedural delays.

Development of a new, standardized permitting framework for qualified projects.

The study team preparing the report is described as approximately 110 experts from over 40 organizations. Some of the participants are stated to have originated from outside of the oil and gas industry.

NPC describes itself as an organization whose sole purpose it to provide advice to the federal government. There are about 200 NPC members which are appointed by the Department of Energy’s Secretary that include:

All segments of the oil and natural gas industry.

All segments of the country.

Large and small companies.

With a major radius of 8 meters, Helios is the most compact optimized stellarator power plant architecture, according to the company.
Next steps: In the next few years, Thea Energy plans to verify and de-risk the operation of the plasma and subsystems in its large-scale demonstration facility, Eos, which is scheduled to be operational by 2030.
Quotables: “Helios does not rely on future scientific breakthroughs,” said David Gates, cofounder and chief technology officer of Thea Energy.
Other innovations include the power handling scheme, where a topology closely related to the conventional tokamak solution has been found for the first time in a stellarator power plant design.”","Formerly Princeton Stellarators, Thea Energy is a spin-out of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Princeton University and was one of eight companies selected in 2023 for the Department of Energy’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. According to the company, the completion of the preconceptual Helios design meets the last major milestone in the initial phase of the DOE’s public-private program to develop fusion pilot plant designs and resolve related scientific and technological challenges.

Paper reactor: Thea Energy has released an unpublished paper, “Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant,” that details the Helios design. According to the company, the system combines software-controlled magnet coils that are adaptable to real-world conditions, a stellarator divertor exhaust system capable of fusion power operations, and a sector-based maintenance scheme enabling long-term plant viability.

Based on a planar coil stellarator architecture, Helios has a thermal power output of 1.1 GW, with the capability of producing 390 MW of net electric power. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils, like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. The coils have a maximum magnetic field strength of 20 tesla.

With a major radius of 8 meters, Helios is the most compact optimized stellarator power plant architecture, according to the company.

Next steps: In the next few years, Thea Energy plans to verify and de-risk the operation of the plasma and subsystems in its large-scale demonstration facility, Eos, which is scheduled to be operational by 2030.

Thea Energy said it is currently in conversations with five states for the siting of Eos and expects to select and announce a location for the integrated system in 2026. The company added that it is on track to operate Helios in the 2030s.

Quotables: “Helios does not rely on future scientific breakthroughs,” said David Gates, cofounder and chief technology officer of Thea Energy. “Helios is designed to combine the inherent benefits of the stellarator—steady-state operation, no risk of damaging disruptions, and high efficiency—with programmable, planar magnets. This is the evolution of the stellarator for commercialization. Our proprietary architecture can individually control hundreds of magnets using a software stack to configure stellarator magnetic fields, while accounting for manufacturing and assembly errors as well as system wear and tear over its operational lifetime.”

Carlos Paz-Soldan, associate professor of applied physics and applied mathematics at Columbia University, added, “Thea Energy’s design presents several significant innovations on the conventional approach to build stellarators. The planar coils are easier to manufacture and promise to reduce overall system complexity. They also provide new flexibility to the concept and facilitate plant maintenance. Other innovations include the power handling scheme, where a topology closely related to the conventional tokamak solution has been found for the first time in a stellarator power plant design.”",https://www.ans.org/file/23003/l/Picture1.png,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:11.027566

The project is positioned as one of Europe’s first fully integrated operations combining lithium production with renewable energy generation.
This scope includes powering Vulcan’s Lithium Extraction Plant in Landau, the Central Lithium Plant near Frankfurt and the surrounding well sites.
Speaking to Reuters, Francis Wedin, Executive Chair of Vulcan Energy, said construction was now fully funded and set to begin immediately.

The project is positioned as one of Europe’s first fully integrated operations combining lithium production with renewable energy generation.

The partnership involves three contracts valued at more than US$50m for ABB to supply the complete electrical infrastructure.

This scope includes powering Vulcan’s Lithium Extraction Plant in Landau, the Central Lithium Plant near Frankfurt and the surrounding well sites. ABB is set to manage the entire electrical system from the high-voltage grid connection down to building-level processes.

The collaboration could provide a model for integrating clean energy with advanced electrification in industrial settings.

Supplying lithium for half a million EVs

The Lionheart Project aims to produce 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) per year. This refined form of lithium is used in batteries and the projected output will be enough to power around 500,000 electric vehicles annually.

Vulcan’s approach combines lithium extraction with the generation of renewable energy, aiming to deliver 275 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity and 560 GWh of heat.

This dual output supports both industrial operations and contributes to broader clean energy goals.

The integrated nature of the facility means that Vulcan can supply lithium and renewable energy from a single project location, offering a more sustainable option for downstream manufacturers.

The company has already secured agreements to supply lithium from 2028 for 10 years to major companies including Stellantis, LG Corp, Umicore and Glencore. These offtake agreements are designed to support a stable supply of lithium for battery manufacturing across Europe.

Speaking to Reuters, Francis Wedin, Executive Chair of Vulcan Energy, said construction was now fully funded and set to begin immediately. He confirmed the project would take two-and-a-half years, with full-scale operations expected once commissioning is complete.

Multi-layered financing

Vulcan’s funding package totals US$2.56bn and combines equity, grants and debt. The equity component includes up to US$709m raised through institutional placements and entitlement offers at a fixed price of US$2.63 per new share.

This financing is backed by 13 financial institutions including the European Investment Bank, five export credit agencies and seven commercial banks. Vulcan has also received US$122m in German government grants as part of Berlin’s strategy to reduce reliance on imported raw materials and strengthen domestic electric vehicle production.

The partnership with ABB stems from a Memorandum of Understanding signed back in April 2024. It aims to streamline engineering, optimise supply chains and reduce project costs. Under the agreement, ABB’s electrification expertise supports Vulcan’s renewable lithium process.

Cris Moreno, Managing Director and CEO at Vulcan Energy, comments: ""ABB’s expertise and systems give us the certainty to scale efficiently. Together, we are establishing a robust model for industrial lithium production to meet market momentum while enabling battery supply chain decarbonisation at scale.”

ABB technology to underpin clean energy goals

ABB’s scope covers high-, medium- and low-voltage electrical systems, including switchgear, transformers, protection equipment and uninterruptible power supplies. The goal is to ensure a stable and efficient flow of electricity from the 110 kilovolt (kV) grid through to every process within the facility.

By handling the design, engineering, manufacturing, testing and delivery, ABB ensures that every aspect of electrical performance aligns with both safety and sustainability standards. The company’s MNS low-voltage switchgear, already used across mining and industrial sites worldwide, is a central part of the infrastructure.

As Vulcan prepares for full-scale construction, ABB’s electrical systems will play a critical role in delivering power safely and reliably.

With lithium output backed by long-term contracts and supported by a network of institutional investors, the Lionheart Project is positioned to become a cornerstone in Europe’s transition to clean energy and sustainable mobility.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/03fa87a5f7d02e71a87a239d771dfdac:6cb6d2a37d15db2177412515609bfed2/vulcan-groundbreaking.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:54.757501

Residential rate hikes are higher, in part, because they fund distribution upgrades that don’t serve industrial customers, according to Duke Energy.
His nonprofit returned a $10,000 sponsorship to Duke Energy early this year.
“This comes after a year during which Duke Energy made record profits,” Cohen said.
Duke Energy announced $1.4 billion in profits last quarter, up 11% from last fall.","Under the proposal, residential rates for Duke Energy Carolinas customers would increase nearly 12%, and by more than 14% for Duke Energy Progress customers. This is what Duke is proposing:

Residential rates for DEC customers would increase 11.9% in 2027 and 4% in 2028.

Residential rates for DEP customers would increase 14.1% in 2027 and 3.5% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEC customers would increase 8.7% in 2027 and 3.9% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEP customers would increase 9.2% in 2027 and 4.6% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEC customers would increase 6.3% in 2027 and 3.4% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEP customers would increase 7.4% in 2027 and 4.3% in 2028.

Residential rate hikes are higher, in part, because they fund distribution upgrades that don’t serve industrial customers, according to Duke Energy. That includes the lines that deliver power to homes and neighborhoods.

Shannon Binns, executive director of Sustain Charlotte, said low- to moderate-income households are being squeezed from both sides.

“It is harder to pay the bills when all the bills keep going up, and income is not going up in the same way,” Binns said. His nonprofit returned a $10,000 sponsorship to Duke Energy early this year. The move came after Binns learned that the utility signed on to a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin requesting that the federal agency roll back carbon and coal ash regulations.

Asheville resident Rachel Cohen expressed a similar sentiment toward the rate hikes during a public utility hearing Tuesday night.

“This comes after a year during which Duke Energy made record profits,” Cohen said.

Duke Energy announced $1.4 billion in profits last quarter, up 11% from last fall. The rate increases will need approval from state regulators.

“It was shocking in a sense that they would be so brazen as to ask for such a dramatic increase, which, of course, higher electric bills fall much harder on low- and middle-income households and seniors and people on fixed incomes, given that they just had a record year for profits,” Binns said.

Binns said recent legislation, such as SB 266, has made it easier for the utility to build riskier new nuclear facilities, as well as new natural gas plants, “adding more fossil fuels and the gases that are heating up our planet.”

Duke Energy proposed a new resource plan earlier that would allow the utility to build 9,650 megawatts of new natural gas capacity over the next decade. Duke representatives said the company still aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, relying on new nuclear facilities to replace energy generated by new natural gas turbines.

Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton said these rate hikes are going toward funding grid hardening and “smart-healing technology.” These projects include “the steel poles along the Swannanoa River that withstood Hurricane Helene.”

“Such grid investments are the majority of the current rate review request,” Norton said in a written response to WFAE. “Other factors in the rate request include weatherization and reliability upgrades for our existing power plants, as well as solar already approved and installed under the initial Carbon Plan. Those are applicable to the current rate case, not to future resource plan projections.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41646e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7214x3787+0+135/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2e%2F49%2Fa07aaf414a1eab92e6c7a6132501%2Fduke-energy-lineman-at-work02-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:44.332868

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom.","Calls are mounting for the largest U.S. grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record of $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in the year starting June 2027, according to PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans, including customers in southwest Michigan. That fee will come on top of what consumers pay for the power they actually use, plus other line items on their bills such as charges for maintaining and expanding the power lines.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive buildout of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators. Vistra Corp., which rose as much as 2.7% in early trading Thursday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.6%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion, with shares up 2.7%.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesperson Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. — will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

,Clean Energy ,2025-12-18 14:44:04+00:00,Inside Climate News,How Do Rooftop Solar and EVs Affect Electricity Costs for Everyone Else? Here's a New Estimate,"Dan Gearino, Nicholas Kusnetz",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18122025/inside-clean-energy-rooftop-solar-electricity-rates/,"The larger point is that rooftop solar increases costs for other consumers while EVs lower them; the size of these effects is likely to increase as market share for solar and EVs rises, according to Linn.
He argues that policymakers should understand the amount of the cost shift to make informed decisions when crafting policies related to rooftop solar.
I asked John Farrell, a rooftop solar advocate and co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Relience, to read and respond to the paper.
I think we need to continually monitor how the growth in rooftop solar and EVs will affect the electricity system and the prices paid by other consumers.
To put it another way, the cost shifts linked to rooftop solar are not near the top of my list of problems to be solved right now.","One of the most divisive topics among environmental advocates and researchers is the claim that the growth of rooftop solar leads to a concerning transfer of costs from households that have solar to those that don’t.

Most people who have studied this agree there is some shift in costs, but they disagree on how much and whether it’s too much.

A recent working paper from economists at the University of Maryland offers a novel way of looking at this issue by examining how rooftop solar and electric vehicles affect electricity demand for the population as a whole, and how each contributes to changes in electricity costs for the public as a whole.

The results, I suspect, will be frustrating for solar advocates and encouraging for EV advocates. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

The paper was written by a team that includes Joshua Linn, who teaches economics at the University of Maryland and is a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that studies energy and the environment. As is common for economics research, the authors are gathering feedback and will revise the paper with the aim of publishing a peer-reviewed version.

Linn and his co-authors found that adoption of rooftop solar has led to a 2.35 percent decrease in electricity utilities’ revenue, which the companies have partially recovered by increasing customer rates by 1.48 percent.

Those are small numbers. But they become more significant when the authors zoom in on the effects on low-income households without solar. The upshot is that these households experience, by far, the most significant negative effects, while high-income households have a net benefit because they gain a large share of the cost savings from using rooftop solar.

The authors found that the use of EVs helps to reduce electricity rates for all consumers, with utilities benefitting from a 0.44 percent increase in revenue and consumers a 0.23 decrease in costs.

Again, small numbers. The larger point is that rooftop solar increases costs for other consumers while EVs lower them; the size of these effects is likely to increase as market share for solar and EVs rises, according to Linn.

The analysis looks at electricity consumers as a whole, including some with solar and some with EVs, some with both, and a large majority that have neither.

“When you put solar panels on your home, you’re imposing a cost on somebody else,” Linn said in an interview.

Linn is not suggesting that the costs exceed the environmental benefits. He argues that policymakers should understand the amount of the cost shift to make informed decisions when crafting policies related to rooftop solar.

The authors make clear that their findings should be understood as short-term effects which cover two to three years. So, we cannot extrapolate the effects on rates in a decade or more.

One of my initial reactions was that the findings could be used to justify policies that support the business interests of utility companies. Utilities tend to oppose rooftop solar and want to encourage EVs, and the companies have used their lobbying power to change net metering policies in states such as California, reducing the financial benefits of solar.

Linn said he doesn’t intend to support any industry’s agenda and that this research didn’t receive any corporate funding. His larger concern, he said, was quantifying how solar and EVs affect the roughly 95 percent of consumers who have neither.

I asked John Farrell, a rooftop solar advocate and co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Relience, to read and respond to the paper. His organization views customer-owned energy resources as essential for creating a more equitable economy and counteracting the harm often done by monopoly utilities.

Farrell said that the paper’s focus on short-term effects is a serious flaw because investments in rooftop solar and other energy-saving technologies yield benefits best understood in timelines that are decades long.

“In a short timeframe, my purchase of solar panels or an energy-efficient fridge will reduce demand and (very slightly) increase the necessary rates to recover costs,” he said, in an email. “But over the lifetime of that investment, the utility can reduce supply contracts, defer transformer upgrades, etc.”

His conclusion: “Doing this study is an interesting intellectual exercise but … it loses sight of the forest for the trees.”

I wouldn’t go that far. I think we need to continually monitor how the growth in rooftop solar and EVs will affect the electricity system and the prices paid by other consumers.

It’s worth noting that the cost shifts in the paper appear small relative to the large rate increases that have happened this year as utilities upgrade their systems to accommodate data centers and other large users.

To put it another way, the cost shifts linked to rooftop solar are not near the top of my list of problems to be solved right now. But 10 years from now, following more consumer adoption, it may be a different story.

So many unprecedented things have happened, that historians will have no shortage of harrowing lessons to be learned from this era.

In the clean energy space, the Trump administration launched attack after attack to slow down the clean energy in favor of fossil fuels, killing projects, investments, and jobs. By rescinding clean energy funding, pushing to abolish tax credits, coordinating across the administration to interfere with wind and solar, and so much more, they’ve set us up for bitter harvests for years to come.

And yet…

Clean energy is strong. And in 2025, it showed its strength in some really notable ways, as momentum, economics, policies, and people carried clean energy progress forward, despite it all. And it seems all the more important to celebrate it this year.

So, here are clean energy bright spots worthy of resounding cheers.

Powering up

One pillar of progress has been growth in renewable energy capacity, for more clean electricity and all the other benefits clean energy brings. And one clear shining star for 2025 is the US solar sector:

2025 looks set to land just a hair’s breadth away from breaking the record for new US solar installations set in 2024. Texas continued to be the leader in new solar, followed by California and—wait for it—Indiana (up from 15th two years ago). Overall, July to September 2025 was the third best quarter ever for new solar installations.

Solar accounted for almost 80% of new electrical generating capacity through September (and 58% of all new electrical capacity, with energy storage included).

All that installation progress helped push solar electricity to new heights: solar generation from January to September 2025 was 29% higher than in the same period in 2024.

US solar manufacturing also grew: module manufacturing capacity increased 42% over the first three quarters of 2025, new capacity to make the solar cells that go into modules came to life in South Carolina, and new capacity to make the wafers that become the solar cells sprang forth in Michigan.

Energy storage was another fount of progress in 2025, with installations for the year projected to be more than 50% higher than in 2024, led by Texas, California, and Arizona.

All told, says the American Clean Power Association, 2025 looks “firmly on pace to surpass 2024 as the biggest clean power deployment year in history.”

Realizing possibilities

Where solar, storage, and other clean energy technologies really shine is in what they make possible in electricity markets around the country. Some examples:

In California, gas electricity generation has fallen as solar generation has risen, and solar in the state, up 13% year-over-year for the first three quarters of 2025, looked set to surpass gas on an annual basis for the first time.

In Texas, where electricity demand is growing fastest, clean energy played a huge role in meeting that increased demand in 2025. Solar generation January-September was 42% higher than in the same period in 2024, and solar seems poised to overtake coal in the state in 2026. The grid operator covering most of the state reported having added 20 times as much battery, solar, and wind capacity as new gas in its service territory since last winter.

In New England, having clean energy available to meet peaks in electricity demand helped send the region’s last coal plant out to pasture. New England solar generation was almost a fifth higher in Q1-Q3.

Even on the water

Though the challenges were unprecedented for offshore wind, 2025 also brought noteworthy happenings in that space. Construction progressed on the next generation of projects, aimed at serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia, and several large-scale ones should reach full power in 2026 (if I didn’t just jinx it…). In service in Virginia to aid the work is the Charybdis, the brand-new wind turbine installation vessel that is the first built in the United States (Texas). Virginia’s offshore wind project will be one of the world’s largest when completed next year, capable of producing enough energy for more than 600,000 Virginian households.

As some of the Trump administration’s spurious excuses to halt under-construction offshore wind projects failed to stand up to legal scrutiny, the importance of offshore wind for economies—not just as a source of clean electrons—was even clearer than usual in the range of voices pushing back and speaking out in opposition to the administration’s monkeying. Those included labor unions, business networks, and even the Republican member of Congress for the Virginia project staging area and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.

Meanwhile, the first operating large-scale US offshore wind project, serving Long Island, showed strong results in its first year—including in the winter months, when offshore wind power comes in particularly handy. New England too was benefitting from offshore turbines, before the projects themselves even reached completion: injections of electricity into the region’s grid led to wind generation from January to early December 2025 that was 26% higher than in the same period in 2024, and led in mid-December to a record for peak wind production that was 29% higher than 2024’s peak.

Lots more to come

As technology moves forward, so do some leading states. Despite—or because of—the federal moves in the wrong direction, multiple states doubled down on their moves toward a clean energy economy in 2025. Maine, for example, committed to 100% clean electricity by 2040. California extended and strengthened its “cap and invest” program. Illinois passed a comprehensive clean energy package. And, because clean energy matters at all scales, it’s worth celebrating Michigan’s moves to make it easier for customers to connect distributed renewable energy systems (think rooftop solar) to the electric grid, and Utah’s embrace of balcony solar.

And there’s a lot more to come for clean energy, despite the even rougher seas ahead in the near term under this administration. Continuing affordability concerns will guide even some slow-to-come-around people to recognize solar and wind as often the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Decision makers and the rest of us who care about good jobs and economic development will continue to push for more policies to accelerate the move to clean energy. Innovation, economies of scale in products and projects, and continued international progress will all make clean energy even more attractive.

There’s a lot about 2025 I’d really like to be able to undo, or forget. But clean energy’s progress despite all that the Trump administration threw at it is notable, and it seems important to celebrate those accomplishments as we go into the new year. Not least to keep reminding ourselves of the enormity of what’s already possible and what’s yielding dividends right now, today, and will be long into the future.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog-Thumbnail-Solar-panels-walking-men-in-the-middle.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:18.780930

Rising electricity demand, growing reliability pressures and deeper renewable penetration are exposing the limitations of cost-only metrics such as Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”). This paper introduces a value-based framework using two new and complementary measures: Levelized Value of Energy (“LVOE”), which reflects the total value a project can create for its owners, and Levelized Net Benefit (“LNB”), which quantifies the broader value a project can deliver to the overall system. We applied this framework to contrast comparably sized advanced nuclear and solar projects in two separate U.S. power markets - which showed that nuclear, despite a higher LCOE, delivers substantially greater owner and system value. The resulting value difference highlights nuclear’s unpriced contribution to system reliability, fuel savings and long-term cost containment. The findings also challenge the common narrative that nuclear is an expensive option when other, lower-cost solutions are available.1

Grid Pressures Are Driving Renewed Interest in Nuclear

The nuclear energy sector is experiencing a level of momentum that would have seemed improbable just a few years ago. Rapid growth in electricity demand from electrification, digital infrastructure build-out, and industrial re-shoring is intersecting with rising reliability concerns and increasingly severe weather events. These pressures are elevating the importance of firm, clean, long-duration capacity.

In this environment, nuclear is re-emerging through life extensions, restarts and uprates of the existing reactor fleet while advanced reactor developers continue to move through licensing, demonstration and early commercial deployment. Corporate buyers, seeking large scale 24/7 carbon-free electricity, have begun signing long-term agreements for nuclear supply. States are positioning themselves as early hosts for next-generation reactor projects and federal support and financing programs have meaningfully expanded over the last few years. Taken together, these developments reflect a renewed recognition of the growing value of firm, clean resources in meeting future capacity growth and reliability needs, yet our evaluation tools have not kept pace with this shift.

Generation technologies across the industry are typically evaluated using LCOE, a metric developed in an era during which energy was largely interchangeable across hours and seasons. LCOE combines capital costs, operating costs, and energy production into a single dollar-per-megawatt-hour figure.2 It is a simple calculation, familiar and internally consistent as a measure of cost. But it is only a cost metric; it provides no information on the value a resource delivers to the grid.

As renewable penetration has deepened, the economic and reliability value of energy has become far more variable. A firm megawatt-hour delivered during a strained evening peak or a weather-driven emergency has a fundamentally different value than a solar megawatt-hour delivered during midday conditions when supply is abundant.

Today’s planning problem is not simply finding the lowest-cost marginal megawatt-hour but designing portfolios that deliver the required reliability and decarbonization outcomes at the lowest system cost.3 That distinction is at the heart of the nuclear value gap — the difference between the total value that nuclear provides to a system and the amount of value that it can capture through current energy market structures.

The Value Gap: From Cost to System Benefit

LCOE was an effective screening tool when grids were dominated by thermal generation; renewable penetration was modest and intraday variability was limited. In that context, the timing, flexibility and duration of output mattered far less for system cost and reliability than they do today. In the contemporary grid, several structural shifts undermine the usefulness of simple cost-only metrics such as LCOE:

Temporal value divergence: Energy value now varies sharply by hour and season, and capture prices depend heavily on when a resource generates.

Adequacy and resilience constraints: More frequent and deeper stress events make firm, multi-day availability increasingly critical for reliability.

Divergent lifetimes: Nuclear and hydro operate for 60+ years, while solar and wind require multiple reinvestments, creating very different long-term system costs.

FTI Consulting Introduces Two Related Value-Based Metrics: LVOE and LNB

To address these gaps, consider two new metrics: LVOE and LNB. The first metric, LVOE, measures the net economic value a project owner can capture for each megawatt hour (“MWh”) produced over the full life of a plant. Like LCOE, it uses a standard levelizing approach: all future cash flows are discounted to present value and divided by the plant’s discounted lifetime generation.

The key difference between LVOE and LCOE is that LVOE adds revenue instead of totaling costs. It incorporates all monetized value streams a project can earn (energy sales, capacity payments, ancillary services and, where applicable, carbon credits) and subtracts the full set of project costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, fuel, refurbishment cycles and decommissioning. In effect, LVOE is the value-based counterpart to LCOE. While LCOE shows what a resource costs per MWh, LVOE shows the net value a project can realize per MWh under current and future market structures.

The second metric, LNB, measures the discounted net economic benefit of a plant to the system. LNB starts with LVOE and adds quantified system-wide cost reductions not compensated in markets, including avoided investment in additional capacity and avoided system fuel costs. Because retail rates are ultimately driven by total system costs rather than the LCOE of individual resources, LNB provides the metric most linked to long-term rate impacts.

The difference between LNB and LVOE, is the unpriced value. A technology (such as solar) that is fully compensated for the value it delivers will show minimal difference between LVOE and LNB. In contrast, nuclear delivers significant reliability, adequacy, and system cost reductions beyond the compensation it receives.

These types of metrics have not historically been part of standard practice. FTI’s novel approach and modeling capabilities now enable credible, technology-specific valuation of both project revenues and system benefits.

Our Methodology and Modeling Approach

To evaluate nuclear’s value relative to solar on a consistent basis, we combine long-term market modeling with project-level financial analysis. For the market modeling, we use PLEXOS,® a commercial optimization platform widely employed by utilities, system operators and regulators for capacity expansion and production cost modeling.

The PLEXOS® model runs on an internally maintained U.S. zonal dataset that includes updated demand projections, existing fleet characteristics and retirements, technology cost trajectories, fuel price paths, transmission constraints and applicable policy requirements. PLEXOS® produces long-term investment outcomes and hourly dispatch results under reliability and resource constraints.

Technology cost and performance assumptions are drawn from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Annual Technology Baseline.4

Figure 1: Overview of Our Cost and Value Modeling Approach

The nuclear case reflects a representative 1 gigawatt (“GW”) advanced reactor, modeled with a multi-year construction profile, major refurbishment cycles, and a 60-year operating life. The comparison case is a utility-scale solar portfolio sized to match the nuclear plant’s total 60-year energy production, including full rebuilds in years 20 and 40.

For our comparison, we selected the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”), the independent system operator for most of Texas, and PJM, a large regional transmission organization spanning multiple Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states, because ERCOT and PJM represent two of the most important (and contrasting) power market structures in the U.S. ERCOT is a large, energy-only, predominantly merchant market with high renewable penetration, making it a natural test bed for how new firm resources compete on price and system value. PJM, by contrast, combines an energy market with a robust capacity market, operates under tighter regulatory oversight and faces strong decarbonization and reliability pressures alongside growing renewables. These systems are both expected to see sustained long-term electric demand growth, so insights from ERCOT and PJM are especially relevant for future energy generation investment and planning decisions.

All metrics in our comparison are expressed in real dollars using discount rates aligned with the LCOE inputs (6% real for nuclear and 3% real for solar), reflecting differences in financing assumptions and technology risk. We focus on two contrasting regions: ERCOT, an energy-only market with high renewable penetration and weather-driven stress events, and PJM, a capacity-market region with a more diversified resource mix and distinct policy dynamics, using a capacity price assumption of $250/megawatt per day.5

Our analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we use PLEXOS® to generate technology-specific hourly prices, captured energy revenues, curtailment and capacity contributions for each region under decarbonizing system conditions. Second, we combine these outputs with cost profiles in our detailed project finance model to compute discounted cash flows and derive LCOE and LVOE for an illustrative 1 GW plant; although illustrative, the results reflect realistic operational and market outcomes. Third, we calculate system-wide avoided costs (primarily foregone gas peaker capital expenditures and lower system fuel operating expenditures) by comparing scenarios with and without the 1 GW nuclear unit.6 We then convert these avoided costs into a discounted per-MWh value and add that number to LVOE to produce LNB.

To reflect climate policy considerations, we compute carbon value at an illustrative $30/ton carbon dioxide (“CO₂”).7 This represents the avoided emissions benefit of nuclear — valued at $30 for every ton of CO₂ displaced relative to a gas generator in a base case. The results of this modeling framework are summarized below for both ERCOT and PJM.

Results: Comparing Nuclear and Solar Across Cost and Value Metrics

A traditional LCOE comparison produces the expected outcome: solar appears less expensive than nuclear on a cost-per-MWh basis in both ERCOT and PJM. This reflects the lower upfront capital cost of solar, but it does not account for differences in timing, durability or reliability.

Figure 2: Solar and Nuclear LCOE Comparison in ERCOT and PJM8

However, once we evaluate monetized net value using LVOE, the comparison shifts. Nuclear generates materially higher owner-level net value per MWh than solar in both regions, driven by its high captured energy value during peak and scarcity times, its firm capacity contribution and its long-lived production profile that avoids multiple reinvestment cycles. The solar LVOE is lower because its captured prices decline with penetration, its effective load carrying capability falls sharply over time and it requires full rebuilds to maintain output over the 60-year period.

Figure 3: Solar and Nuclear LVOE Comparison in ERCOT and PJM9

When we incorporate unpriced system benefits, the divergence becomes even more pronounced. Nuclear reduces the need for additional peaking capacity, lowers system fuel consumption and improves reliability during stressed conditions. These avoided costs materially increase the nuclear LNB. In contrast, the solar LNB is essentially identical to its LVOE because most of its contribution is already monetized in existing market structures, and its integration needs to offset remaining system benefits.

Figure 4: Breakdown of Nuclear Value Components (LVOE to LNB)

The resulting value gap (unpriced system value) captures nuclear’s unpriced contribution to the grid, including long-duration firm capacity, extreme-weather resilience and avoided system expenditures. This gap explains why nuclear can lower long-term system costs even with a higher LCOE, whereas solar’s low LCOE does not automatically translate into lower system costs once firming, storage and integration needs are considered. Put simply: rates follow system cost, not project cost — and nuclear lowers system cost.

Even a modest carbon price further widens this gap, adding meaningful value to nuclear, which can accrue either to the project (through credits) or to the system (through avoided emissions). In Figure 4, the carbon value is included in the LNB figures for simplicity and completeness. Although carbon is not the driver of the results, it reinforces the conclusion: cost-only metrics understate the total value that nuclear provides.

Implications for Developers, Investors, Utilities and Policymakers

This novel LVOE and LNB approach highlight several important implications for stakeholders across the nuclear value chain and broader energy system.

For developers and technology vendors, the findings support commercial strategy and business development efforts by better quantifying the full nuclear value proposition. Demonstrating avoided system costs, resilience benefits and long-lived output enables developers to communicate a clearer, more compelling case to customers and regulators, moving beyond cost-only comparisons toward a value-centered narrative.

For investors and project owners, the analysis provides improved visibility into project economics under realistic market and dispatch conditions. A better understanding of the unpriced system value can inform discussions on commercial structuring, risk allocation and long-term contracting approaches. At a time when investors are starting to express concerns that nuclear could be the next “bubble,” this clarity can help unlock additional capital by aligning project economics with the value nuclear provides to the system.

For utilities and large energy buyers, LVOE and LNB provide clearer visibility into both project-level value and system-level benefits. These metrics help identify how firm, clean resources contribute to overall portfolio performance, reliability and long-term cost trajectories. By understanding the full value delivered by each resource (not just its cost), utilities and buyers can make more informed portfolio choices, balance reliability and decarbonization goals, and avoid future system costs associated with firming, storage and adequacy requirements.

For policymakers and system operators, this approach provides clearer insight into the system value that nuclear can deliver and how it shapes long-term cost trajectories. By quantifying LVOE and LNB, the framework helps inform integrated resource planning efforts, regulatory design and energy policy decisions that recognize resources that reduce future spending on capacity, fuel and integration. This is particularly important today as state governments are increasingly reviewing prior energy policy decisions and their impacts on ratepayers. Incorporating these insights can support more efficient planning, strengthen reliability and ultimately help moderate long-term rate pressures.

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cost-only comparisons are no longer sufficient — durable, least-cost outcomes emerge only when both monetized and unpriced system value are fully reflected in investment, planning and policy decisions.

Summer Nuclear Station could deliver long-term economic, workforce, and energy infrastructure benefits for South Carolina, reinforcing the state’s role in the next phase of U.S. nuclear deployment.

The study, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and released by Westinghouse Electric Company, evaluates the economic impact of completing two partially built AP1000 reactors at the V.C. Summer site in Jenkinsville. PwC’s assessment concludes that the project would generate billions in economic activity during construction and sustain thousands of high-skill jobs once operational.

Construction Phase Drives Near-Term Economic Impact

According to PwC, the seven-year construction period—expected to run from 2026 through 2032—would contribute an estimated $7.3 billion to South Carolina’s gross domestic product. During this phase, the project would support an average of approximately 7,300 jobs annually, totaling more than 51,000 person-years of employment across engineering, manufacturing, construction, and project management roles.

Labor income during construction is projected at $4.1 billion statewide, with tax revenues reaching approximately $1.6 billion when federal, state, and local impacts are included. PwC notes that leveraging the existing partially built infrastructure at V.C. Summer significantly reduces both construction costs and deployment timelines compared with greenfield nuclear projects.

Beyond South Carolina, the national economic footprint during construction would be even larger. PwC estimates $13.8 billion in U.S. GDP and nearly 13,000 jobs supported annually across the broader supply chain, underscoring the project’s relevance to domestic manufacturing and industrial policy objectives.

Long-Term Operations Deliver Sustained Employment

Once operational, the two AP1000 units would provide approximately 2,300 megawatts of nuclear capacity—enough to power at least 1.5 million homes in South Carolina. PwC projects that ongoing plant operations would generate $1.6 billion in annual state GDP and support roughly 2,700 jobs each year over a minimum operating life of 80 years.

Cumulatively, long-term operations are estimated to produce more than $130 billion in state GDP, alongside $30 billion in labor income and $31 billion in tax revenues. Nationally, operational impacts would reach $2.1 billion in annual GDP and support approximately 3,700 jobs across the U.S. economy.

Workforce Development and Nuclear Cluster Effects

PwC’s analysis emphasizes that economic impacts extend beyond direct employment. The project would require approximately 1,000 permanent, highly skilled workers onsite, including engineers, nuclear technicians, chemists, and operations specialists. Westinghouse plans to invest heavily in workforce training and partnerships with educational institutions to ensure a qualified labor pipeline.

South Carolina already hosts a significant nuclear energy cluster, employing more than 16,000 workers statewide. Completing the V.C. Summer reactors would reinforce this ecosystem, strengthening supplier networks, attracting related industries, and anchoring advanced energy skills in the region.

Infrastructure, Grid Reliability, and Policy Context

The report situates the V.C. Summer restart within broader national energy policy trends. The project aligns with federal efforts to expand nuclear capacity as a tool for grid reliability, energy security, and industrial competitiveness. The AP1000 technology is currently the only Generation III+ reactor operating commercially with fully passive safety systems and an established global deployment track record.

With electricity demand rising from data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification, the analysis frames large-scale nuclear projects as foundational infrastructure rather than standalone generation assets. By reactivating a partially completed site, South Carolina could accelerate deployment while minimizing land use and construction risk relative to new builds.

A Long-Horizon Infrastructure Decision

PwC’s findings present the V.C. Summer restart as a multi-decade infrastructure investment with implications well beyond short-term job creation. The combination of construction-phase stimulus, long-term operational employment, and grid-scale carbon-free power positions the project as both an economic development and energy resilience strategy for the state.

While final investment and regulatory decisions remain ahead, the report concludes that completing the two AP1000 units would represent one of the most consequential energy infrastructure investments in South Carolina in decades—one with measurable impacts on jobs, GDP, and the future structure of the state’s power system.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251217-113218-54e-Gen%20III%2B%20AP1000%20reactor.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:03.855842

Consequently, numerous companies have developed VPP programmes, which frequently offer solar or battery systems at no cost or a reduced price in exchange for leveraging these systems to help maintain grid frequency and reliability.

Energy-Storage.news looks at recent news from Sunrun and NRG Energy, Haven Energy, and Leap and Enel North America as the companies advance VPP programmes across the US.

Sunrun and NRG partner to provide residential storage in Texas

US residential solar and energy storage installer Sunrun and energy supplier NRG Energy have announced a multi-year partnership aimed at accelerating residential energy storage in Texas.

Texas residents will have access to a home energy solution that combines Sunrun’s solar-plus-storage systems with “optimised rate plans and smart battery programming,” provided by NRG Energy’s retail electricity provider, Reliant.

As new and existing Sunrun customers sign up with Reliant, the total capacity will be leveraged to address the rising demand in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market.

The companies will collaborate to develop offers that aggregate and dispatch distributed power assets, supplying electricity to Texas’s grid during peak demand times. Sunrun will receive payment for aggregating capacity, while Reliant customers who participate will be compensated by Sunrun for sharing their stored solar energy.

In November, Sunrun reported a revenue of US$724.6 million for the third quarter of this year, as the company pursued its “storage-first strategy”.

Sunrun has achieved its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth. The company’s revenue rose from US$569 million in the previous quarter, and the Q3 figure reflects a 35% year-over-year increase compared to US$537.2 million in Q3 2024.

The company also took part in California’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) distributed storage programme. During a test on 29 July, DSGS helped lower the net load on the state’s grid. However, shortly afterwards, California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office reduced the programme’s funding.

In May, VPP provider Sonnen collaborated with Abundance Energy and Energywell Technology Licensing to create a battery-enabled VPP in Texas. This VPP enables Abundance Energy customers to utilise sonnenConnect residential battery systems to enhance grid stability and reduce electricity expenses.

Haven Energy secures US$40 million to expand VPP networks

Haven Energy, a home battery systems company, has raised US$40 million to boost its partnerships with utility companies and community choice aggregators (CCAs). The funds will allow expansion of its leasing model, enhance its Channel Partner Programme for local installers, and support the ongoing development of “one of the nation’s largest VPP networks.”

The US$40 million comprises an equity round led by Giant Ventures and a debt facility from Turtle Hill, with further equity investments from California Infrastructure Bank, Carnrite Ventures, Chaac Ventures, Comcast Ventures, and Lerer Hippeau.

Haven states that US energy demand is expected to increase by 15% by 2030, growing faster than new generation and transmission infrastructure can be developed. This will lead to higher costs, increased outages, and greater pressure on the grid.

The company states it is tackling this challenge by working with utilities to install home solar and battery systems for its customers. These DERs provide utilities with flexible, local capacity that enhances the grid’s stability and contributes to lowering energy costs.

Haven also claims it has installed over 10MW of distributed capacity with more than 50MW in development for 2026, with over US$75 million worth of projects in its pipeline.

This capacity underpins both Haven’s expanding VPP and the utility-run programs that Haven develops for its utility partners. Current partners include Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Clean Power Alliance (CPA), San Jose Clean Energy (SJCE), Clean Energy Alliance (CEA), and Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE).

The funding will also facilitate the growth of Haven’s leasing model and Channel Partner Programme. This programme allows trusted local installers to provide Haven’s solar and battery solutions directly to homeowners and incorporate these installations into the company’s VPP. Haven handles financing, operations, and performance, allowing installers to focus on installation.

In June, Haven and CEA collaborated to offer California homeowners BESS without any purchase or installation expenses. The Battery Bonus Connect programme will serve around 300 homeowners and is financed through California’s US$280 million Self-Generation Incentive Program Residential Solar & Storage Equity (SGIP RSSE) initiative.

Leap and Enel partner on nationwide VPP growth

Leap, a software provider for aggregating DERs, and independent power producer (IPP) Enel North America have announced a partnership to expand the connection of commercial and industrial (C&I) DERs to utility demand response programmes across the country.

Together, Enel and Leap will utilise existing C&I capacity on the grid to manage energy demand in real time across Enel’s utility network, while generating additional revenue for Leap’s C&I partners.

The collaboration will start with three utility programmes managed by Enel in Washington, Arizona, and the Tennessee Valley, and will gradually expand to other markets nationwide.

Enel states that collaborating with Leap enables the company to rapidly increase capacity enrollment in its demand response programmes, while offering C&I customers new opportunities to generate revenue by aiding grid stability.

Leap, meanwhile, sees a wider expansion into vertically integrated utility markets, offering its technology partners additional revenue opportunities for the C&I resources the company sells and manages.

In February, Leap announced its expansion into the PJM Interconnection wholesale market. PJM, a regional transmission organisation (RTO), manages the flow of electricity across parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

Leap’s software enables customer devices within the PJM region to automatically modify energy consumption to help stabilise the grid during emergencies.

The work relates to Phase One of the Lionheart development, located in the Upper Rhine Valley, a region with significant geothermal potential that underpins Vulcan Energy’s integrated renewable lithium production model.

The Lionheart Project is designed to combine renewable energy generation with lithium extraction and downstream processing. Once operational, the project will supply battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) to the European electric vehicle sector, supporting regional battery manufacturing and reducing reliance on imported raw materials. At full Phase One capacity, Lionheart is expected to produce approximately 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate annually—sufficient to support the production of around 500,000 electric vehicles each year. In parallel, the integrated system will generate about 275 GWh of renewable electricity and 560 GWh of renewable heat, reinforcing the project’s low-carbon credentials.

Under three separate contracts with a combined value of €46 million, ABB will act as the main electrical contractor for the project. Its responsibilities span the entire electrical scope, including detailed design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, and final delivery of critical electrical systems. The contracts cover multiple facilities central to the Lionheart value chain, including the lithium extraction plant in Landau, the central lithium processing facility at Industriepark Höchst, as well as associated geothermal well sites distributed across the Upper Rhine Valley.

The electrification package encompasses high-, medium-, and low-voltage distribution systems, transformers, variable speed drives, uninterruptible power supplies, and advanced protection equipment. Together, these components will ensure a stable, reliable, and efficient supply of electricity, distributing power seamlessly from the regional 110 kV grid down to individual process units and building-level operations. This robust electrical backbone is essential to maintaining continuous production and meeting the stringent quality requirements for battery-grade lithium products.

The latest contracts build on a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two companies in April 2024. That agreement aimed to simplify engineering workflows and strengthen project execution by aligning design optimization, supply-chain coordination, and cost performance. By formalizing this collaboration, the partners are laying the groundwork for what is expected to become Europe’s first fully integrated renewable lithium operation.

Senior executives from both sides emphasized the broader strategic importance of the project. ABB highlighted Lionheart as a model for how clean energy systems and advanced electrification can be combined to strengthen Europe’s battery materials supply chain at a time of rapidly growing electric vehicle demand. Vulcan Energy, meanwhile, underlined the importance of reliable, scalable electrical systems in enabling industrial-scale lithium production while keeping emissions low and supporting supply chain decarbonization.

The execution of these contracts is also a key condition for project financing. Vulcan Energy has indicated that it is targeting financial close, along with the completion of additional project and financing agreements, in the fourth quarter of 2025. Once finalized, the Lionheart Project is expected to play a pivotal role in supporting Europe’s transition to clean mobility through locally produced, low-carbon lithium.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:51.515689

Among the most influential, and often most confusing of these rules, is the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS).
Over the past decade, frequent regulatory changes and court decisions have left many farmers questioning what WOTUS really means for their operations.
From the mid-1980s onward, the agencies operated under a regulatory definition that broadly interpreted WOTUS to include many waters.
Understanding the Proposed WOTUS Rule On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA.","Market Intel, produced by the Farm Bureau economic analysis team, provides market and policy insight and analysis for our farmer and rancher members nationwide, as well as policymakers on Capitol Hill. This Market Intel is a special policy analysis on the recently proposed waters of the United States rule.

Key Takeaways:

For decades, the definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act has been unclear, leading to regulatory uncertainty. Five rule changes since 2015 and conflicting court decisions created a “ping-pong” effect, leaving farmers unsure which water features on their land fall under federal jurisdiction.

In their ruling in Sackett v. EPA, the Supreme Court eliminated the “significant nexus” test, which broadened the federal government’s jurisdictional reach. The ruling clarified that only relatively permanent waters and wetlands with a continuous surface connection to regulated waters fall under federal jurisdiction. This decision was widely praised for providing the clearest legal standard in decades.

The Trump administration’s proposed WOTUS rule adopts Sackett’s framework, excluding isolated ponds, disconnected wetlands, and most ditches. It shifts the burden of proof from landowners to the federal government and allows states to regulate beyond federal standards. While the rule aims for clarity, challenges remain — such as proving sustained flow during wet seasons.

For years, farmers and ranchers have worked their land with a close eye on the weather, volatile markets, farm policy and the many regulations that shape everyday business decisions. Among the most influential, and often most confusing of these rules, is the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). Over the past decade, frequent regulatory changes and court decisions have left many farmers questioning what WOTUS really means for their operations. From the start of this debate, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been the leading voice across industry sectors, consistently advocating for clear, practical regulations that protect farmers while ensuring environmental stewardship.

The Evolving Definition of WOTUS

Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), the term WOTUS serves as the threshold that determines which water bodies fall under federal jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the statute offers little clarity on where that jurisdictional line should be drawn. Over the years, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the agencies) have exploited this ambiguity, expanding their authority far beyond what Congress intended when drafting the law.

From the mid-1980s onward, the agencies operated under a regulatory definition that broadly interpreted WOTUS to include many waters. This expansive interpretation repeatedly ran up against judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court’s decisions on the limits of the federal government’s regulatory reach, in cases such as Riverside Bayview Homes, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, and Rapanos, often created more questions than answers.

For example, the Supreme Court’s 4-1-4 split in Rapanos created conflicting standards for federal jurisdiction. Justice Scalia’s plurality introduced the “relatively permanent waters” test, while Justice Kennedy’s concurrence advanced the “significant nexus” test. With no majority opinion, this fractured guidance left regulators and courts without a clear rule, fueling years of litigation and inconsistent interpretations as successive administrations struggled to define WOTUS.

Beginning in 2015, the regulatory uncertainty was exacerbated as different presidential administrations attempted to make sweeping changes, creating a swinging pendulum of regulations. Consequently, the definition of WOTUS became a legal and regulatory maze — one in which wetlands, ditches, seasonal streams, drainage features or even ephemeral streams (low spots in a farm field) could be regulated. Over the last decade, there have been five different rulemakings on WOTUS. The ping-ponging of definitions has produced anxiety and uncertainty for farmers and ranchers whose decisions on the farm depend heavily on clear rules.

Sackett v. EPA: A Turning Point for WOTUS Clarity and Certainty

The 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA marked one of the most consequential shifts in federal water regulations since the passage of the CWA. This decision greatly narrowed the types of water features and wetlands regulated as a WOTUS and simplified compliance for landowners. The Supreme Court accomplished this by unanimously eliminating the troubling “significant nexus” test, which allowed the federal government to set up a case-by-case regulatory regime that expanded their jurisdictional reach beyond legal boundaries.

Additionally, the ruling greatly restricted the types of wetlands that fall under federal authority by providing proper guardrails for “adjacent wetland.” Farmers and ranchers across the country praised the Court’s decision because it is the clearest, most decisive legal standard for WOTUS in decades and appropriately reigns in the federal government’s authority.

Understanding the Proposed WOTUS Rule

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA. The rule represents the greatest narrowing of the federal government’s jurisdictional reach over private property. As directed by the Supreme Court, the proposal only regulates water bodies that are “relatively permanent” — meaning surface waters that flow or stand year-round or those that flow throughout the wet season — and wetlands that are directly abutting a regulated tributary and have a continuous surface connection.

As an example, features like isolated ponds, field-edge depressions, disconnected wetlands, groundwater and many ditches or prior-converted cropland would be excluded. The rule also proposes to define key terms (like “tributary,” “ditch,” “prior converted cropland,” etc.) to bring consistency and predictability to what is “in” and what is “out.” This also reduces the amount of land subject to the regulation, cutting down regulatory costs across the industry.

Most importantly, this rule shifts the burden of proof away from the landowner and places this responsibility squarely on the federal government, meaning a farmer no longer must prove that they do not have a WOTUS on their property to use their land.

It is critical to recognize that this rule upholds the cooperative federalism objective of the CWA by allowing states to serve as the primary authority in regulating water. State governments can regulate far beyond the definition of WOTUS and impose their own, more stringent rules. In many states, just because a water feature is not regulated by the federal government, does not necessarily mean that it goes unregulated.

While this rule is an important step forward in creating a legally durable definition of WOTUS, implementation of the rule may present some challenges. One potential hurdle for some landowners will be determining if there is sustained flow throughout the wet season. In some instances, field-level data may need to be collected, which could significantly slow down the jurisdictional determination process. This also impedes farmers’ ability to use their land, potentially cutting their production and revenue capacity.

The Cost of Compliance

Ensuring compliance under WOTUS for farmers can include several major components that impact a farmer’s cost of production:

Obtaining Clean Water Act federal permits for activities like fencing, drainage or pond construction;

Hiring consultants and technical experts for wetland determinations;

Experiencing operational delays while waiting for permit approvals; and

The cost of mitigation activities which can often be substantial.

Because Clean Water Act compliance carries significant civil and criminal liabilities — up to $64,000 per day or even jail time — it is critical that farmers fully understand the rules to avoid inadvertent violations.

How WOTUS Shapes Everyday Farm Decisions

Farmers care about the definition of WOTUS because it determines which ditches, wetlands and water features on their land fall under federal regulation — and therefore which everyday activities may require permits, carry compliance obligations or expose them to legal risk and regulatory costs to ensure compliance. Whether they are installing tile, building a fence, cleaning out a ditch, expanding cropland or managing drainage after heavy rains, the scope of WOTUS directly influences what farmers can do without federal oversight.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/250926/WOTUS_16x9-twitter.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:03:16.510470

Opponents of the plan warned that it puts existing ratepayers -- including residents and large companies -- at risk of higher electricity costs. The policy approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission comes in the wake of projects like Meta's $27 billion data center announced last year and a facility for Anthropic announced Wednesday.

Gov. Jeff Landry's ""Lightning Speed"" executive order to reduce red tape inspired the new amendment. Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan proposed the initiative as a way to ""accelerate the timelines required for major employers to invest, build and grow in Louisiana.""

""We have been last in so many things for far too long and we're seeing some material success in growth across sectors,"" Coussan said at the commission's monthly meeting.

This change will exempt utilities trying to build new infrastructure for data centers from going through a process that requires them to prove the new generation is the cheapest and most reliable option on the market. It also directs the regulators to vote on new projects within eight months of an application, faster than the typical yearlong timeline.

In order for a project to qualify for the streamlined process, a company must meet requirements including a letter from the state's economic development agency ""confirming the customer's interest and the importance of power availability"" and a contract of at least 15 years.

The amendment passed by a 4-1 vote, with only Commissioner Davante Lewis opposing. Lewis called the new policy a ""dangerous precedent"" that ""lowers the standards"" for projects trying to get new infrastructure on the grid. He noted that the new policy criteria are less stringent than the power plan approved for Meta, a monthslong regulatory process that faced significant pushback from environmental, consumer and industrial groups.

Meta's northeast Louisiana data center, the company's biggest yet, will require roughly three times the amount of electricity that New Orleans uses on an annual basis. Entergy is building three new gas-fired power plants to meet the demand.

The commission meeting grew tense at times, with commissioners talking over and interrupting each other.

What's the new rule?

A utility can go through the fast-tracked ""lightning"" route as long as the customer pays for half of its infrastructure costs, the new rule stipulates. Meta, for instance, is paying for the full annual revenue of the electricity plants that will power the facility, though not for all of the new infrastructure needed.

Lewis was the only commissioner to vote against the plan for Meta's center, on the grounds that the agreement left fundamental questions on the table, including the lack of a competitive bid process. On Wednesday, he proposed a separate framework to address issues that large-scale data centers are presenting to regulators.

That proposal aims to ""ensure that the public interest is considered in a transparent and deliberative process, while balancing economic development, improving grid reliability, and protecting affordable rates."" It was deferred to the next commission meeting, with all four of the other regulators voting to delay.

'Decades of sharply increasing bills'

Advocacy groups opposed Coussan's proposal, arguing that the policy removes needed guardrails and fails to give regulators enough time to assess the impact of future projects. Logan Burke, who runs the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said that removing protections will mean ""decades of sharply increasing bills.""

""Understanding the amount of pressure that you are receiving from other elected bodies, but you are five duly elected decision makers who get to make these decisions,"" Burke said.

A coalition of some of the largest industrial users in the state, including chemical manufacturers and oil companies, also objected to key aspects of the new policy. Randy Young, a lawyer for the Louisiana Energy Users Group, wrote a letter to the regulators earlier this week saying that waiving the typical regulatory process ""adds significant risk and potential costs to the ratepayers.""

Regarding the Meta deal, Entergy says the new power plants will not lead to higher bills for average ratepayers.

For Buckingham, the investment the United States is making into the mining of these materials will be well worth the initial costs.","SERRA BLANCA, Texas (NewsNation) — An otherwise nondescript mountainside in West Texas could be part of the Trump administration’s solution to ending the United States’ reliance on countries like China for rare-earth materials that are essential to building missiles, fighter jets and technology.

NewsNation received an exclusive look at one key location that is being targeted for mining these rare materials. Locating these minerals could provide the United States with economic independence from China. Officials have gone as far as characterizing the issue as a matter of national security and say that mining operations could begin as early as 2028.

The Trump administration has announced plans to launch a coalition of partners on Friday, when the Pax Silica Declaration will be signed. The pact will unite Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Israel and is designed to address deficits in critical minerals access, which will edge out China’s massive investment in its critical minerals and tech sector, officials say.

Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have been instrumental in China’s restriction of exports of rare-earth materials to the United States. Meanwhile, Trump has struck deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan.

The Guardian recently reported that the United States and China have brokered a trade truce on rare-earth materials. However, China currently controls about 70% of global mining and more than 90% of global processing capacity. That has put the U.S. behind the 8-ball in trying to source more of these materials in places like Round Top Mountain in West Texas.

It has also allowed China to take control of the rare-earth supply chain and being able to manipulate geopolitical markets that the United States is now attempting to tap into. But to do so, work must be done to ensure the U.S. has enough natural resources at its disposal to make the kind of dent it is seeking to create.

“China has a corner on this market,” Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham told NewsNation. “We think this is the only and largest complete set of rare earth minerals not under China’s control in the world. These are important for our jets to fly. It’s national security. It’s everyday convenience. It’s taking away this economic play from China.”

To accomplish that, more mining is expected to take place in locations like Round Top Mountain, where Dysprosium and Terbium, which are two critical rare-earth materials. Dysprosium is valued largely for its magnetic properties, which are used primarily in everyday electronics like smartphones and speakers, but also in defense systems.

Terbium, meanwhile, is another rare-earth material that is known for its bright green luminescence, which is used for lighting displays and high-performance magnets for electronics such as wind turbines, electric vehicles and sonar systems.

Buckingham says that Round Top Mountain is one of the most unique mining sites in the country. Inside the mountain, 17 rare-earth materials can be found that will be critical in helping eliminate China’s monopoly on the rare-earth market. All of the land where these materials can be found is state-owned but is then leased to mining companies such as USA Rare Earth.

Alex Moyes, the company’s vice president of mining, told NewsNation that the company has already conducted smaller-scale pilot programs that are helping locate rare-earth materials. He said that the magnets that are made from these valuable materials are critical in national security. For example, magnets are used in missile motors and to control the steering capabilities of the missile.

“So, if all of a sudden the magnet that’s steering your guided missile demagnetizes, you no longer have control of where your missile’s going to go,” Moyes told NewsNation.

Initially, the cost to mine these materials from the earth may be more expensive than paying for those in China. However, in time, the costs will drop as the supply chain scales and the U.S. conducts more rare-earth business with countries with which it has struck deals. For Buckingham, the investment the United States is making into the mining of these materials will be well worth the initial costs.

“(It’s about) our energy independence — that elemental independence — making sure our jets can fly, our missiles can work, our phones function, everything we need to educate our children,” Buckingham said. “It’s important to invest in America.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/12/snapshot-4-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-18 12:00:36.740362

DOE has issued emergency orders to keep coal plants from retiring, part of its focus on fossil fuels. And it’s pushing to expand the data center boom.

“It’s been a massive swing,” said Tom Pyle, president of the fossil-fuel-supporting, free-market group American Energy Alliance.

In a heavily divided nation, the Trump agenda at DOE is triggering applause from conservatives and fossil fuel supporters and consternation among environmentalists. Climate activists and public health advocates say the DOE under Wright is advancing policies that raise energy prices and expose Americans to harmful pollution tied to fossil fuel emissions.

“Chris Wright has fully embraced Donald Trump’s war on renewables, and that’s extremely significant,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program. “Almost on a weekly basis, Secretary Wright posts social media content from his official government accounts spreading complete misinformation and lies about renewable energy and particularly about solar.”

Wright himself is a major change-maker in the federal government and energy world. As a former CEO of fracking services company Liberty Energy, Wright is steeped in data on energy systems and a frequent guest on media outlets like Fox News. At an event last week, Trump called Wright the “greatest oil man anywhere in the world.”

Despite some apparent rifts with the White House of late, including the firing of a top DOE official closely tied to Trump world, conservatives are fully behind Wright.

“Secretary Wright is just a really, really knowledgeable person. He’s extremely well qualified for this job,” said Pyle.

Heading into the next year, many questions remain about how the Trump administration intends to execute its energy policy: What specific loans will be offered to energy companies? How many more billions of dollars might be cut from Biden-era projects?

All of these questions come as electricity demand is projected to increase dramatically, along with utility bills for everyday Americans.

DOE did not respond to requests for comment.

Are the changes durable?

Some of the changes at DOE under Wright are likely to have a short shelf life if a new Democratic administration takes power, including the renaming and shuffling of offices. Other changes could have more staying power.

Critics of the administration say the layoffs and grant cuts, more of which could be in the offing over the coming months, will cause companies and American workers to think twice about teaming up with the federal government in the future.

“I had convinced a bunch of people to go into the department, who then all got fired and now say they would never go back to work for the federal government. So that, I think, is a huge loss,” said Kate Gordon, CEO of the non-profit California Forward and a former adviser to Secretary Jennifer Granholm under Biden. “It might be generational. We worked incredibly hard in the administration to try to make it exciting for people to go into government. It’s hard to do.”

Staffing cuts will also have “long-term consequences” because of the large amounts of money the department is tasked with moving out the door, said Alex Kizer, an executive vice president at the EFI Foundation and a former DOE staffer during the Obama administration.

It’s unclear if DOE will aim to address the staffing crunch with contractors or new hires with specific skill sets, he said.

The administration’s push to add dramatically more power to the electricity grid could also have staying power.

“Now everyone is talking about the need for more energy for AI and to stay ahead of China,” said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation. “I think that that is going to stick with people because that seems to be nonpartisan. Everyone wants us to have the best AI and data centers. Both parties want us to stay ahead of China in that.”

Reorganization and funding cuts

A reorganization last month at DOE moved the decades-old Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to a new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation. It also cut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which was created by Congress in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, and renamed the Loan Programs Office the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.

Gordon said the cut to OCED and grant cancellations, most of which stem from the infrastructure law, flout U.S. laws.

“We organized partly around deployment, which is something that the agency didn’t do. Trump just got rid of that [OCED], which I don’t think is allowed because it was created in a bill by Congress. But what does ‘it’s not allowed’ mean anymore?” she said. “What we’re seeing now is just a complete separation of the executive from the will of Congress and that is a very strange and disturbing thing to see.”

Some changes could be reversed easily in the future, considering that Biden and the first Trump administration also reorganized offices.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a megalaw signed by Trump in July, rescinded the “unobligated balances” of Inflation Reduction Act funding for the OCED, along with other programs at DOE. The administration’s supporters say that paved the way for DOE to retool priorities.

“I don’t think the department should be in the business of deployment. It should be in the business of research and development,” said Pyle, referencing DOE’s historic R&D role in energy development.

Jessie Stolark, executive director at the Carbon Capture Coalition, said from the group’s understanding, “under the recent DOE reorganization, unspent OCED funds are being reprogrammed to other offices within the department.”

Claire Cody, an analyst at Clean Tomorrow who worked at DOE earlier this year, said parts of OCED will likely be split up, although the office was authorized as a distinct entity. “We’ll have to see what Congress does about that,” she said.

Typically, deobligated funds are returned to the Treasury if they are not being challenged by affected companies, but there are restrictions on how they can be reused. For example, DOE is supposed to only reobligate funds that are still within their appropriation window and that are tapped for their original statutory purpose directed by Congress.

Kizer said he suspected that billions of dollars of funding could be reprogrammed by the Trump administration, but it is a “big area of uncertainty.”

Efficiency no more

DOE is proposing to roll back dozens of regulations, including a laundry list of appliance efficiency rules, which force manufacturers to sell products that use less energy. Lawsuits on the efficiency rollbacks are expected once DOE issues finalized rules.

The Trump administration also proposed cutting the Weatherization Assistance Program, a 50-year-old initiative that subsidizes equipment efficiency upgrades for low-income households, while EPA is waffling on whether to continue Energy Star, a program that certifies efficient household equipment and buildings.

Meanwhile, the OBBB cut tax credits for homeowner efficiency upgrades. Efficiency advocates say the rules help to meet load growth and reduce Americans exposure to pollutants.

“These rollbacks would just increase bills for families and businesses and add extra strain on the electric grid,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “The only folks who might benefit are companies making and selling super-inefficient products overseas who could send them here.”

Furchtgott-Roth and other conservatives say the efficiency rules deprive Americans of market choice.

“We’ve moved from an energy scarcity era in the Biden administration to an energy abundance era in the Trump administration,” she said. “There’s no need for the government to set rules for efficiency.”

Efficiency advocates say the federal rollbacks put the onus on the states. But states like Arizona are also nixing efficiency funding.

A new report from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said the efficiency rules are “raising prices, limiting product choice, and undermining performance, reliability, and longevity.”

More fossil fuels and nuclear

Supporters of Wright and Trump also say the embrace of fossil fuels increases U.S. energy security and stature globally as an energy exporter.

“By taking the steps President Trump is, he’s detaching us from China. He’s making us independent,” said Furchtgott-Roth. “If we were to have gone the Biden route, we would have been dependent on these renewables and batteries.”

While environmentalists are critical of the administration’s dismantling of climate policy, some note that DOE is not going full steam ahead on liquefied natural gas exports.

“The Department of Energy has actually been proceeding much more cautiously because I think industry advised them that they need to,” said Slocum. “If you approve an LNG application in a hasty or sloppy manner, it could be undone by courts and things could get tied up for a long time.”

Slocum said a recent approval of the CP2 LNG export project “was very careful and really went through the protesters’ arguments in pretty significant detail.”

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has pushed aggressively for more LNG commitments in U.S. trade deals. But the trade deals announced this year are not the traditional pacts approved by Congress with the force of law.

“The trade and tariff associated LNG push that Secretary Wright has been intimately involved in … when you start to put a microscope on it, it’s a big nothing burger so far,” said Slocum.

Even still, the proposed Alaska LNG project — despite the Trump administration’s zealous support for it — has yet to reach a final investment decision on the project’s 807-mile natural gas pipeline. Trump officials have touted several nonbinding agreements for the project.

On the homefront, Wright has used emergency authorities to force utilities to operate fossil fuel plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington. And new policies to boost fossil fuels keep rolling in. In early December, for instance, Wright teased new rules to use fossil-fuel-based backup generators to meet demand growth.

Meanwhile, nuclear energy is a major priority for the administration. The White House has pledged to quadruple nuclear energy in the United States by 2050 and is pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite license approvals.

DOE is poised to fund new uranium enrichment projects in the U.S., with a deadline approaching on a cutoff for Russian imports that are vital to the U.S. nuclear sector. But so far, utilities are moving sluggishly — if at all — to contract to build new nuclear plants.

AI, renewables and clean tech

A central question lingering over DOE in the coming months is what will happen to emerging technologies that could either advance or stall depending on federal funding. DOE has played a significant role in the past in commercializing technologies such as utility-scale solar through its loan office and other grants.

“We haven’t seen the most aggressive RFIs and requests for proposals … compared to how much funding they have available. Will there be new areas that emerge?” Kizer asked.

He said he is also watching closely how DOE taps nonmonetary tools to advance technologies, citing the department’s move in October to take a 5 percent stake in Lithium Americas.

Wright has framed much of DOE’s strategy around the push for AI, including plans to build data centers on federal land and implement the “Genesis Mission” on supercomputing.

One technology with a murky future is “clean” hydrogen, which was a focus of the Biden administration and backed by $8 billion under the infrastructure law. DOE has since moved to cancel two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast tied to producing fuel with renewables, but the fate of six other hubs — and billions of dollars from the law — remains up in the air.

What DOE decides will be particularly important for “blue” hydrogen produced with natural gas tied to carbon capture. According to analysts, that form of hydrogen is likely to be the focus in the U.S. partly because of rollbacks in federal support for renewables that would bolster “green” hydrogen.

But blue hydrogen has shown signs of struggling, underscoring the importance of the infrastructure law funding for the industry. Last month, Exxon Mobil said it was pausing plans for a major blue hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, because of weak customer demand.

Environmentalists also have been raising concerns that administration changes to DOE models could allow hydrogen companies receiving federal tax credits to release more methane emissions with projects than previously envisioned.

With other emerging technologies, like fusion, funding is also a critical issue. Wright has been pushing for fusion — which envisions power plants using the same reaction powering the sun — and the recent DOE reorganization created a new office for the industry. The move will help gear the department more toward commercialization of projects, but details are being sorted out, said Andrew Holland, CEO of the Fusion Industry Association.

The new office shows the “administration takes seriously the goal and challenges of getting fusion energy commercialized,” said Holland, who met with Dario Gil, DOE’s undersecretary for science, this month.

But “there’s a reality that we’re in a budget-constrained environment,” he said in an interview. The fusion office currently is funded at around $800 million, and the industry is pushing for funding closer to $1 billion annually.

“We’re confident if the administration asked for it, Congress would support them,” Holland said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d8/fc/65d3ee274f048e4f384ae6b95a21/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2239622469,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:36.099346

This has become especially true in the hydrogen and ammonia market due to the slow and insufficient investments in infrastructure. Air Products, a market-leading hydrogen and ammonia company with substantial assets, has developed a plan with Yara International, a global ammonia and crop nutrition company, to combine their significant assets to increase hydrogen and ammonia output across the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Hydrogen and ammonia production have become the belle of the renewable energy ball

The international energy market has been developing frameworks to increase the production capacity of the hydrogen and ammonia market. Amid the calls to diversify energy assets and phase out reliance on fossil fuel-based energy generation, hydrogen has emerged as the undisputed king of the renewable energy market and has now been boosted by the news that Air Products and Yara are joining forces on two new hydrogen projects in the US and Saudi Arabia.

The pair of companies aims to integrate Air Products’ hydrogen and ammonia production capabilities with Yara’s market-leading ammonia supply network. The world has been consumed by the need to reduce emissions in the energy market and increase renewable energy generation over the coming years.

The Louisiana Clean Energy Complex is one of the projects targeted by Air Products and Yara

Air Products is exemplifying its substantial expertise in the hydrogen market by developing what will become the largest low-carbon energy complex anywhere in the world. The Louisiana Clean Energy Complex in the United States has been designed to produce approximately 750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen.

While Air Products is the project developer, Yara will be waiting in the wings to acquire the ammonia production once it reaches acceptable levels. Yara will also take over the necessary storage and transport of the ammonia produced for roughly 25% of the total project costs. Next up for the pair of companies will be the NEOM hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia.

“We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world’s leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,” – Air Products’ Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project is set to reshape the global energy market

Seeing as though the NEOM hydrogen project has reached a critical point, with over 90% of construction being completed, the next step is to offer an offtake agreement for the hydrogen and ammonia produced. Air Products has been selected as the sole offtaker for the reported 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia at the site.

Transporting hydrogen and ammonia can be exceedingly expensive, and Yara will handle the transportation of the energy resources through its vast maritime transport vessels that will boost the sector globally. Both companies are targeting final investment decisions for the two projects by 2026.

“Air Products’ two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara’s flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. – Yara’s CEO Svein Tore Holsether

The global hydrogen and ammonia production market is growing at an incredible pace

With the progress made at the NEOM Green Hydrogen and ammonia facility in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex, Yara and Air Products are set to bring in the new year with a renewed sense of optimism. The need to diversify the international energy market has become paramount for the global community.

That reduction coincides with a case backlog TCEQ faces.
As of August, the agency reported a backlog of 1,480 enforcement cases.
In the past, the EPA would help investigate state claims, but as the federal agency faces its own cuts, state cannot rely as much as in year prior.
These state budget numbers that come out are not per capita of the total budget.","The Texas Commission for Environmental Quality has struggled to keep up with enforcement claims amid years of cuts to the state environmental agency's budget, according to a recent study.

When adjusted for inflation, TCEQ’s budget was cut by roughly one-third between 2010 and 2024, even as the number of regulated industrial facilities in the state increased, according to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The agency in 2010 had a budget of $539 million. The agency most recently worked on a $407 million budget in 2024.

That reduction coincides with a case backlog TCEQ faces. As of August, the agency reported a backlog of 1,480 enforcement cases.

In some cases, claims remain untouched for several years, said Kathryn Guerra, a former TCEQ employee who now works as an agency watchdog with the nonprofit group Public Citizen.

“Historically, the agency's own enforcement policy was to hold enforcement cases for several years,” said Guerra, who also worked with EIP for their Texas analysis. “And that unfortunately created for the TCEQ a really extensive backlog of pretty complex cases. In one instance, very recently, we saw an enforcement case go before the commissioners for approval, that was 10 years of enforcement action.”

According to the TCEQ, of the 9,198 complaints filed in 2025, just 6% of claims were investigated within five days. Nearly 55% of claims took a month or more to address.

That could leave some communities without recourse, said Andrew Quicksall with SMU’s environmental health and compliance quality program.

“It's like any other sort of enforcement or investigation that you may do,” Quicksall said. “Eventually things get backlogged to a point where you can't address them. And we have those problems where we have environmental claims that go without investigation because the backlog is so large.”

Quicksall also said cuts at the federal level have also strained the TCEQ's enforcement bandwidth. In the past, the EPA would help investigate state claims, but as the federal agency faces its own cuts, state cannot rely as much as in year prior.

The EIP's report also found that during the last legislative session, TCEQ requested nearly $60 million in additional funding and over 150 new staff positions to address its growing workload.

Following the 2025 Legislative Session, lawmakers only approved part of TCEQ’s $60 million and increased staffing request only granting the agency 67 new positions and a $47 million budget.

That limited funding can shape how vigorously the agency pursues enforcement, Guerra said.

“TCEQ has discretion to implement its own enforcement policies, and we're seeing those policies be very lenient towards industry,” he said. “The agency can be its own worst enemy with those enforcement policies because they've created a really complex backlog of cases by just holding them. Ultimately, what that means is that the communities that are suffering from environmental harm are not seeing any relief.”

TCEQ declined to provide a comment for this story, but the agency did send its annual enforcement policy report. In that report the agency says nearly a third of complaints are never investigated by the TCEQ but are either referred to another agency or are closed because of insufficient information.

The agency does acknowledge in its report that it has steered away investigators from enforcing new complaints because they were assigned to reducing its backlog.

Texas has seen a boom in industry and population in recent years. Advocates warn that if those trends continue, the reduced TCEQ budget may not be able to keep up with new enforcement claims in both existing and new sectors like data centers coming into the state.

In North Texas, Google already has two data centers in Red Oak and Midlothian with plans to build two more centers in the coming years. Google alone plans to invest $40 billion in Texas over the next two years. Other companies have also made plans in recent months, with millions of dollars coming to the state.

While state leaders have been eager to bring in these facilities, the massive centers use a significant amount of energy and water.

TCEQ, in a letter to the state legislature, warned increases in permits and new technologies like AI data centers could strain the agency’s operation.

""Without additional resources, it will be difficult for TCEQ to meet the increasing demands placed on the agency, including emerging technologies, and maintain state primacy for many of its programs.” the agency told lawmakers ahead of this year's session.

Guerra worries growing industry could strain the already stretched investigators.

""I'm very concerned about the TCEQ's capacity to regulate the industries it presently regulates and with this really booming expansion of AI and data centers that, by nature, take up significant resources and thereby need regulating,"" said Guerra.

Despite seeing a marginal increase in the past few years, the TCEQ is not positioned to handle growing demand, according to SMU's Quicksall.

“Our population is exploding,” Quicksall said. “And that's kind of a hidden issue here. We should be increasing [the budget] because of our increasing population. These state budget numbers that come out are not per capita of the total budget. But of course, our emissions, our environmental needs, roughly, are per capita.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory.
Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.
Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers.","Calls are mounting for the largest US grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in 2027, according PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans. The fee is a charge to ensure access to supplies, but doesn’t include the costs of power used.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive build-out of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators, Vistra Corp., which rose 1.9% in late trading Wednesday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.1%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesman Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities – Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. – will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans.","On Tuesday, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, announced that a major climate research center will be “broken up.” The National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, is a significant contributor to research on the weather, climate, and other atmospheric phenomena. The move will be a crippling blow to climate research in the US and is being widely decried by scientists.

Vought initially gave a statement regarding NCAR to USA Today and later confirmed the outlet’s reporting on social media. Calling it “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought also decried what he termed “woke” activities at NCAR. These appear to be fairly typical efforts made to attract underrepresented groups to the sciences—efforts that were uncontroversial prior to the current administration.

NCAR is primarily based in a complex on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado, and maintains a supercomputing center in Wyoming. Much of its funding comes from the National Science Foundation, but the day-to-day management is handled by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a nonprofit that represents 130 individual educational institutions. In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans. NCAR hosts a series of webpages that explain its research and all the ways it helps society.

Vought indicates that the government will specifically target what were termed “green new scam research activities,” while moving other aspects of the center’s work to different institutions. The government doesn’t directly manage activities at NCAR, though, and it’s not clear whether its agreement with UCAR allows it to directly order these sorts of changes. The NSF has since released a statement that suggests it’s ready to do as ordered; it references preserving a list of critical functions that does not include climate change, and discusses divesting NCAR resources like its supercomputing center and research aircraft.

UCAR, for its part, has issued a statement indicating that the USA Today article was the first it has heard of the matter.

In many cases where the administration has attempted to take drastic actions like this, courts have ruled that they run afoul of a legal prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” federal actions. That said, courtroom losses haven’t inhibited the administration’s willingness to try, and the time spent waiting for legal certainty can often accomplish many of its aims, such as disrupting research on politically disfavored subjects and forcing scientists to look elsewhere for career stability.

Scientists, meanwhile, are reacting with dismay. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” said Texas Tech climate researcher Katharine Hayhoe. “Everyone who works in climate and weather has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.”

Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, called NCAR a “unique and valuable asset” and emphasized the wide range of research conducted there.

Obviously, shutting down one source of information about climate change won’t alter what’s happening—greenhouse gases will continue to behave as physics dictates, raising global temperatures. But the Trump administration seemingly views everything through the lens of ideology. It has concluded that scientists are its ideological opponents and thus that its own ideologically driven conclusions are equal to the facts produced by science. Because of that perspective, it has been willing to harm scientists, even if the cost will eventually be felt by the public that Trump ostensibly represents.

Carol Howle, current Executive Vice-President, Supply, Trading & Shipping, will serve as interim CEO until April. Auchincloss will serve in an advisory role until December 2026.

O’Neill, currently CEO of Woodside Energy, oversaw the acquisition of BHP Petroleum International. Before joining Woodside Energy in 2018, she spent 23 years at ExxonMobil in technical, operational and leadership positions.

Albert Manifold, Chair of BP, said her “relentless focus” on business improvement will prepare the multinational firm for its next growth phase.

“The board believes this transition creates an opportunity to accelerate our strategic vision to become a simpler, leaner, and more profitable company,” he said.

Auchincloss said after more than three decades with BP, now is the right time to hand the reins to a new leader, and despite the announcement taking the markets by surprise, insisted it has been in his plans.

“When Albert became Chair (in July), I expressed my openness to step down were an appropriate leader identified who could accelerate delivery of bp’s strategy,” he said.

Auchincloss, who took over as CEO from Bernard Looney last year, was responsible for a fundamental reset of BP’s strategy, scaling back some ambitious low-carbon energy investments and increasing focus on oil and gas production to boost returns and compete with rivals.

Despite the strategic changes, BP’s share price performance lagged its rivals, and the stock was 16% lower at the end of his first year as permanent CEO than at the start. This underperformance led to criticism and pressure from activist investors such as Elliott.

BP recently pulled out from the H2Teesside blue hydrogen project in a fresh set back to the UK’s hydrogen industry and government’s net zero push.

BP exited the Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in Pilbara, Australia, in July, as it pivoted to fossil fuels.

At the end of April, BP announced it will supply natural gas to Woodside for its Louisiana LNG project, marking Woodside’s first secured tranche of feed gas for the site.

Alongside the merger with BHP Petroleum, Woodside Energy said O’Neill led the company to final investment decision (FID) on the Scarborough Energy Project, startup of the Sangomar Project, FID for the Louisiana LNG Project, and the Beaumont New Ammonia acquisition, among others.

Emboldened by the 2024 election results that resulted in full GOP control of Washington, Republicans began the year on a political high, but it’s been rough going since then. President Donald Trump’s job ratings have slipped back into mediocrity, and Democrats have consistently overperformed in elections around the country.

It’s possible that voter sentiment will improve from a rebounding economy, helping Republicans narrowly salvage their majorities in Congress. But what’s more likely is the political environment gets worse for the GOP, allowing Democrats to experience sizable midterm gains.

While it’s wise to be open-minded about a wide range of outcomes, particularly more than 10 months from an election, there are two most likely scenarios for 2026.

A GOP squeaker

Republicans are aware of the historical midterm trends: In recent weeks, both Speaker Mike Johnson and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson have mentioned defying them. The president’s party has lost House seats in 20 of the past 22 midterm elections, and the fewest number of seats lost in those cycles were four (1962) and five (1986). House Republicans can’t afford to lose more than two next year.

But the conditions during the two midterm outliers, 2002 and 1998, don’t match the current environment.

In 2002, Republicans gained eight House seats, bolstered by President George W. Bush’s 68 percent job approval rating during the first midterm. And Democrats gained five House seats in 1998, when President Bill Clinton’s job approval was at 66 percent. Trump’s job approval rating is 43 percent, according to Nate Silver’s national average.

Even if Trump were to abandon his tariffs and the economy bounces back, his job approval is unlikely to get much higher. That’s just not what happens to presidents of either party at a similar point. Typically, presidents become less popular as midterms approach. More specifically, the average drop is 8 points off their job approval rating.

The most encouraging midterm scenario for Republicans might also be the most recent. President Joe Biden’s job approval rating was 40 percent for the 2022 elections, according to Gallup, and yet Democrats lost a modest nine House seats and even gained a Senate seat. The Republican gains were, of course, enough for the House majority, but the cycle could have been much worse for Democrats given Biden’s political condition. This cycle, a nine-seat loss might be enough for Republicans to hold on to the House if the outstanding redistricting efforts break in their party’s favor. And anything less than a four-seat Democratic gain in the Senate would preserve GOP control of that chamber.

But, on the current trajectory, the midterms are likely to get more difficult for Republicans.

A GOP wipeout

It’s clear that GOP strategists believe the current political environment is poor when a common refrain heard is “There’s still time.” Not only should that be added to the list of “Things Losing Candidates Say,” but there’s little evidence that time will help Republicans since the current trend line is working against them.

Trump’s job approval rating has been on a steady decline from 52 percent at the beginning of his term to 43 percent now, according to Nate Silver. That tracks closely with his previous White House stint, when his approval rating was at 38 percent during the 2018 midterms, according to Gallup, and Democrats had a net gain of 41 seats. Over those four years in office, his popularity didn’t improve demonstrably.

Democrats currently have a narrow advantage on the generic ballot, 44 percent to 41 percent, according to the Decision Desk HQ average. And, maybe more importantly, they’ve been consistently overperforming their 2024 margins in a variety of real races and places, from coast to coast, over the past year. Their candidates overperformed in Democratic areas (Virginia, New Jersey, California), Republican areas (Tennessee’s 7th District, Florida’s 1st and 6th) and swing areas (Georgia).

Republicans can try to explain away individual contests, but the trend is clear. And even the Republican wins in 2025 should be concerning for the party because of the reduced margins, sometimes even with good turnout.

A similar overperformance in November would deliver the House to Democrats with plenty of seats to spare and put the Senate within reach. Republicans should win GOP-leaning states such as Ohio, Iowa, Texas and Alaska under normal political conditions. But if 2026 is extraordinary for Democrats, the elections could feel closer to 2018, 2010 or 2006 than to 2022.

More than the president literally putting his name on midterm ballots as he suggested this week, Republicans need Trump’s political standing to improve. They need voters to feel better about the economy, cost of living and direction of the country with Republicans in power. Time is running out on their ability to blame Barack Obama for the high cost of health care and Biden for the economy, particularly when both are so far out of the public eye.

There are plenty of other potential pitfalls for the GOP, including the rising costs of health care (especially if the Affordable Care Act subsidies expire and there’s no alternative), Trump’s immigration tactics and retribution tour, the Epstein files, the president’s age, a war with Venezuela that no one knew was necessary and a White House ballroom no one knew was needed. Even good economic news would have a tough time cutting through all the other noise.

The bottom line is that the Republican Party doesn’t do well in elections in which President Donald Trump is the focus. And by nature of his personality and being the incumbent president, the GOP is on track for that scenario to repeat itself. When recent outcomes match up with historical trends, it’s up to the other party to demonstrate how this cycle is going to be an aberration.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/house_gop_458_121625.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:39.995995

Randy Weber, R-TX, has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act of 2025, a bill aimed at establishing voluntary federal standards for environmental claims on packaging.

The legislation seeks to eliminate misleading labels that confuse consumers about recycling and composting, while promoting transparency and consistency across the industry.

Across the United States, a patchwork of state regulations has allowed unverified claims such as ""recyclable,"" ""compostable,"" and ""reusable"" to appear on packaging, often without any connection to real-world recycling or composting systems. This inconsistency has made it harder for consumers to determine what can actually be recycled and has undermined legitimate environmental initiatives.

""Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,"" Weber said in a statement. ""The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It's pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.""

Issues & challenges

Packaging and labeling standards in the United States are increasingly shaped by state-level regulations, particularly those adopted in California. Due to the size of California's market, the state's standards often have national implications for manufacturers, supply chains, and consumers, even when companies operate primarily outside of California. This dynamic has raised concerns about regulatory consistency and the impact of state-specific requirements on interstate commerce.

The PACK Act would require environmental claims on packaging to be scientifically verified and recognized by existing recycling programs. By ensuring claims are backed by credible evidence, the bill aims to build consumer trust in environmentally friendly packaging without imposing additional mandates on companies. Industry leaders have expressed strong support for the initiative, emphasizing its potential to create a clear, national framework for packaging regulations.

Currently, packaging regulations vary significantly across states, creating confusion for consumers and challenges for businesses navigating inconsistent requirements. Industry representatives have commended the PACK Act for addressing these regulatory inconsistencies. They believe the bill will help streamline compliance, reduce consumer confusion, and support the adoption of sustainable packaging practices.

If passed, the PACK Act could mark a significant step forward in aligning environmental claims with scientific standards, fostering greater transparency, and enhancing consumer confidence in recycling and composting efforts.

Groups offer support

Lynn Dyer, president of Ameripen, praised Weber for introducing the PACK Act and expressed the organization's support for the bill's creation of a federal framework for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

""This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging,"" Dyer said. ""Ameripen will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.""

The Plastics Industry Association also voiced its support for Weber and the PACK Act.

""The Plastics Industry Association thanks Congressman Weber for introducing the PACK Act,"" said Matt Seaholm, PLASTICS President and CEO. ""Plastic packaging is essential to modern life — protecting products, keeping food fresh, and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely — yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims. This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.""

Seaholm emphasized that the PACK Act would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines.

""As an industry that employs more than one million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber's leadership on this important issue that strengthens US manufacturing and consumer confidence,"" Seaholm concluded.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt08823f5db61ded5d/blt1b0889e6d697ef2f/694313a2fad0bfe41e34fe4f/CapitolHill.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:52.147840

For years, there was no comparison between Tesla and any American EV start-up, but the company's current struggles have led some investors to consider alternative plays. While the electric vehicle industry has a long road ahead, I think investing in Rivian could be a better choice right now. Here's why.

Tesla is losing steam

Tesla is by no means finished in the EV market, but the benefits that came from its early lead in electric vehicles are certainly starting to fade.

For one, Tesla faces immense competitive pressure, both from Chinese automakers abroad and at home. The company continues to lose market share around the world and, in the U.S., Tesla's vehicle sales reached a nearly four-year low in November.

Moreover, Tesla's financial picture is no longer as strong as it once was. The company's revenue rose just 12% in the third quarter to $28.1 billion, largely due to some customers rushing to purchase a Tesla before the EV tax credits expired. Even with the temporary bump, Tesla's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income fell 37% from the year-ago quarter to $1.4 billion.

That decline came as Tesla's operating expenses rose 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase for such an established company. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has set his sights on autonomy and robotics as the future of the company, and that's starting to fuel more spending.

I don't think it's misguided for Tesla to incorporate these goals into its future plans. After all, automated vehicles (AVs) could be worth an estimated $1.4 trillion by 2040, and humanoid robots may be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050. But they're also unproven markets that will take billions of dollars to develop over the coming years.

Add all of this up, and Tesla is spending more at the same time its lead in EVs is tumbling -- a bad combination.

Rivian has big ambitions, but success isn't guaranteed

Investors looking for a sure bet won't find it in Rivian, I'm sorry to say. The company, like Tesla, faces rising competition, and unlike Tesla, it isn't profitable. Rivian reported a net loss of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, with operating expenses increasing nearly 30% to $1 billion.

But one thing I think Rivian has going for is that it appears to have a solid plan for attracting customers with smaller budgets. The company's smaller R2 SUV will go on sale next year, starting at just $45,000. And in 2027, it plans to launch an even cheaper R3, priced around $40,000.

If Rivian can hold to this price tag, the R2 will be $5,000 cheaper than the average new car price -- traditional combustion engine vehicles included -- and the R3 will be $10,000 cheaper. The one nagging reason why car buyers avoid EVs is because of their cost, so if Rivian can continue to lower its prices it could potentially attract more customers.

Moreover, producing the R2 and R3 will help the company lower expenses by spreading manufacturing and production costs across more vehicles in its model lineup, and potentially increase sales by widening its customer base.

“Each iteration of the state energy plan has focused on addressing immediate needs and proactively addressing challenges on the horizon.
This is why this State energy plan is so important.","With an eye on 2040, the State Energy Planning Board voted unanimously to approve a State Energy Plan, which is based on findings from more than a year-long assessment of current systems and future energy needs that will guide the energy-related decision making.

Its objectives include ensuring affordable, abundant, reliable, and clean energy while supporting economic development, equity, and a healthy environment. The plan also embraces a continued commitment to renewables while also noting that a variety of energy sources, like advanced nuclear and natural gas, will be needed to help New York meet its overall energy needs over the next 15 years.

“The State Energy Plan is the product of a pragmatic and objective process that comes at a critical yet challenging time for energy planning in New York as we continue to build out renewable resources while factoring in new energy demands and confronting federal headwinds,” said Doreen M. Harris, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and chief executive officer. “I commend my fellow Board members and state agency staff for their dedication to developing this Plan, which identifies specific actions to advance over the next several years while maintaining resource diversity – which is key to continued energy reliability and affordability for all New Yorkers.”

The plan was developed at a time when the energy sector faces significant uncertainty stemming from economic pressures and a shift in federal priorities and policies away from renewable energy projects. The analyses conducted for the Plan have been updated to reflect the latest available data and federal actions since modelling was completed for the Draft Plan released in July. Updates also included further focus on energy affordability considerations and strategies to manage system costs, including through demand-side flexibility and added discussion of new, large loads and ways to manage associated grid and cost impacts.

The analyses inform five primary planning goals and associated actions to continue to meet New York’s energy needs which include:

— Delivering abundant, reliable, resilient and clean energy through a diverse mix of resources and supply infrastructure, while supporting energy efficiency and load flexibility.

— Providing affordable energy to households and equitable benefits – with a focus on reducing the upfront costs of efficiency and clean energy choices to help cut spending and lessen the burden for lower-income households.

— Supporting economic growth and competitiveness by investing in workforce development, meeting the needs of large energy users, and attracting new industry, including clean energy leaders.

— Strengthening partnerships across New York’s innovation ecosystem to foster economic development, create jobs, and provide greater leverage for State investments.

— Continuing progress toward decarbonization and a clean energy economy.

One of Western New York’s largest providers showed its support for the plan. “NYSERDA and the State Energy Planning Board demonstrated strong, thoughtful leadership in their 2025 State Energy Plan, expanding on Governor Hochul’s call for an all-of-the above approach,” said National Grid New York President Sally Librera in a statement. “Importantly, the plan recognizes critical electric and natural gas infrastructure investments are needed to meet the growing demands of our customers, including businesses that power our economy. National Grid stands ready to support the next phase of policy making that will ensure New York’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future.”

The process to update the State Energy Plan was announced in August 2024. The State Energy Planning Board, comprised of the heads of 10 state agencies and authorities, appointees from the governor, Senate, and Assembly, and the president of the New York Independent System Operator, commenced its work to assess and compile data to inform the Draft State Energy Plan, which was released in July for public review and comment.

The release of the Plan follows a public comment period which included 10 public hearings, seven in-person and three virtual, and written comments. The State Energy Planning Board received and considered nearly 15,000 written comments and more than 1,000 people attended public hearings, with nearly 450 providing oral comments – which were also considered. The Board received input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including individual New Yorkers, environmental organizations, utilities and energy companies, labor unions, and trade and business organizations, underscoring the importance of the Plan’s focus on energy affordability and maintaining an abundant and diverse mix of energy sources and supply infrastructure.

“Energy planning is far from a simple endeavor,” said New York State Public Service Commission Chair Rory M. Christian said. “Each iteration of the state energy plan has focused on addressing immediate needs and proactively addressing challenges on the horizon. Today, we have many challenges. Rapid load growth, increasingly frequent severe weather driven by climate change and a constantly evolving federal landscape that is absent of the stability needed to ensure energy security. This is why this State energy plan is so important. Through this effort, we chart a path toward a cleaner, sustainable energy future.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.post-journal.com/images/2016/10/31144144/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 04:00:36.284439

EVXL’s Take I’ve watched solid-state battery promises for nearly a decade now, and I’ve developed a simple rule: take any announced timeline and add five years.","I’ve been tracking solid-state battery announcements for years now, and the gap between what manufacturers promise and what they actually deliver keeps getting wider. Top Gear’s latest deep-dive on next-generation EV tech finally puts some honest timelines on the table, and they’re not what most prospective buyers want to hear.

Here’s what you need to know:

What: Rimac Technology revealed its solid-state battery prototype at the Munich IAA show, developed with ProLogium and Mitsubishi

When: Test car by 2028, production car (likely a Bugatti) around 2030, price parity with conventional batteries by 2035

The specs: 25% more energy density, 10-80% charging in 6-10 minutes, non-flammable, retains 95% capacity at -4°F (-20°C)

Why it matters: If you’re waiting for solid-state batteries to hit mainstream EVs, you’re looking at a decade-long wait

The Timeline Problem Nobody Wants to Discuss

Rimac COO Nurdin Pitarević was unusually candid in his assessment. “It’ll take until 2028 before there’s a battery in a test car, and around 2030 before it’s in a production car,” he told Top Gear’s Paul Horrell. And that production car? Almost certainly a multi-million dollar Bugatti, not something you or I will be cross-shopping against a Model Y.

The 2035 price parity target is the number that should grab your attention. That’s when Pitarević expects solid-state batteries to cost the same as today’s NMC lithium-ion packs. For context, that’s the same year the EU plans to ban new combustion engine sales.

This tracks with what we’ve seen from every major SSB announcement. Toyota has been promising solid-state batteries since 2020, pushing the target from 2023 to 2026 to now 2027-2028. QuantumScape, backed by Volkswagen, just demonstrated their technology in a Ducati motorcycle at IAA Munich, but actual cars remain years away.

The Semi-Solid Reality Check: Nio Already Tried This

Here’s something the solid-state hype machine doesn’t want you to know: Nio already shipped semi-solid batteries, and they discontinued them.

The Chinese automaker’s 150 kWh semi-solid battery pack, developed with WeLion, promised 650+ miles of range and hit the market in late 2023. It worked. CEO William Li personally live-streamed a 14-hour, 1,044 km (650 mile) drive to prove it.

Then they stopped making it.

“We deployed the battery packs providing our users the option to flexibly upgrade to the 150kWh [and] found that actually they are not using this pack as often as we expected,” Li explained to EV media in November 2025. Translation: when you have good charging infrastructure (Nio operates 2,300+ battery swap stations in China), nobody wants to pay premium prices for extreme range.

The 150 kWh pack’s subscription fee was prohibitive, and only a few hundred units were ever produced. It wasn’t a technology failure, it was a market failure. Customers voted with their wallets, and they chose convenience over capacity.

The Players: Who’s Actually Close to Production?

The solid-state landscape breaks down into three tiers:

Tier 1: Actually demonstrated in vehicles

QuantumScape and VW’s PowerCo debuted their QSE-5 cells in a modified Ducati V21L motorcycle at IAA Munich. The specs are impressive: 844 Wh/L energy density and 12.2 minutes from 10-80% charge. But a motorcycle and a mass-market car are very different animals. PowerCo has a license to produce up to 40 GWh per year when the technology matures, enough for roughly one million vehicles.

Tier 2: Validated cells, no vehicles yet

Factorial Energy has validated 77Ah cells with Stellantis and Mercedes, claiming 375 Wh/kg energy density and 18-minute charging from 15-90%. Mercedes drove a modified EQS 750 miles on a single charge using Factorial’s quasi-solid-state batteries. A demonstration fleet is planned for 2026, but Factorial’s true solid-state “Solstice” technology isn’t expected until the end of the decade.

Tier 3: Big promises, long timelines

Chery claims 600 Wh/kg energy density and 808 miles of range, targeting pilot production in 2026 and mass production in 2027. Toyota continues to promise 621+ miles of range and 40-year battery lifespans, but has yet to put solid-state cells in a production vehicle despite a decade of announcements.

Range Extenders: The Technology That Actually Works Today

While the industry chases solid-state dreams, a simpler solution is quietly taking over.

Range extenders (REX) use a small gasoline engine purely as a generator to charge the battery, never directly powering the wheels. The technology had its moment a decade ago with the BMW i3 REX and Chevrolet Volt, then largely disappeared from Western markets.

Now it’s back, and Chinese automakers are leading the charge. Li Auto built its entire business on extended-range EVs, running on batteries 95% of the time with a small engine for backup. BYD’s DM-i models, Yangwang’s U8, and Mazda’s MX-30 all use the technology.

The Western response is coming. BMW plans to launch the iX5 Rex by 2026 with a targeted 621-mile total range. The company is also considering range extenders for the X5 and 7-Series in China, where its sales have collapsed 30% as local manufacturers dominate with exactly this technology.

Supplier ZF has developed a plug-and-play range extender solution that could be used to retrofit existing battery electric cars, expected from next year. VW’s Scout brand will offer range-extended SUVs in the US, and Ram is preparing a range-extended 1500 REV pickup targeting 690 miles of total range.

Why Range Extenders Make Sense Right Now

The math favors range extenders in the near term:

Smaller battery, lower cost: A REX vehicle can use a 30-40 kWh battery instead of 80-100 kWh, dramatically reducing the most expensive component.

No range anxiety: When the battery depletes, the engine kicks in as a generator. You can refuel anywhere, not just at charging stations.

Peak efficiency: Unlike a traditional hybrid where the engine powers the wheels at varying RPMs, a REX engine runs only at its optimal efficiency point. This makes the “depleted battery” phase more efficient than a standard hybrid.

Electric driving experience: Because the engine never directly powers the wheels, you still get the smooth, quiet electric driving experience 95%+ of the time.

The downside? When you’re flat out on an autobahn or towing uphill after the battery is depleted, you’re limited to whatever power that small engine can generate. For most driving scenarios, this is never an issue.

EVXL’s Take

I’ve watched solid-state battery promises for nearly a decade now, and I’ve developed a simple rule: take any announced timeline and add five years. Toyota promised production SSBs by 2020. It’s 2025, and they’re now targeting 2027-2028. Rimac is refreshingly honest about 2030 being realistic for hypercars, with mainstream affordability pushed to 2035.

Here’s what I expect: Range extenders will become the dominant “bridge technology” for the next 5-7 years, especially in markets with limited charging infrastructure. We’ll see semi-solid batteries (like Factorial’s FEST technology) hit premium vehicles by 2026-2027. True solid-state won’t reach mainstream affordable EVs until the early 2030s.

For prospective buyers, the practical advice is straightforward: If you’re buying an EV in 2025-2026, don’t wait for solid-state. If range anxiety is your primary concern and you’re considering a pure BEV, take a serious look at extended-range options from Chinese manufacturers or wait for BMW’s iX5 Rex in 2026.

The Nio 150 kWh experiment proved something important: extreme range isn’t what most EV owners actually want when they have convenient charging. What they want is the confidence that they won’t be stranded. Range extenders deliver that confidence today, without waiting for battery chemistry breakthroughs that remain years away.

On December 11, JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on DTE Energy to $145 from $151 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. This sentiment was posted as the firm broadly updated models in its North American utilities group.

Earlier in its Q3 2025 earnings report, the company disclosed total operating earnings of $468 million, translating to an EPS of $2.25, which beat Street estimates by $0.14. The company’s total revenue totaled $3.53 billion in Q3, which was a 21.37% year-over-year increase and beat estimates by $295.19 million.

DTE Electric was the standout performer, achieving $541 million in operating earnings, a substantial $104 million increase compared to Q3 2024. However, the DTE Gas segment reported an unfavorable operating earnings result of $38 million, which was $25 million lower than Q3 2024, mainly due to higher O&M and rate-based costs. Separately, DTE Vantage delivered $41 million in operating earnings, an $8 million increase from 2024, while Energy Trading contributed $23 million for the quarter.

The company also announced a major increase to its capital plan and strategic initiatives driven by significant deals in the data center market. DTE finalized an agreement with a leading hyperscaler to support 1.4 gigawatts of data center load, a key milestone in its growth strategy.

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.

The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect … Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”

That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.

Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting … intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

In an unsigned written statement on Wednesday, the science foundation said that it was “reviewing the structure of the research and observational capabilities operated by” NCAR.

“NSF remains committed to providing world-class infrastructure for weather modeling, space weather research and forecasting, and other critical functions. To do so, NSF will be engaging with partner agencies, the research community, and other interested parties to solicit feedback for rescoping the functions of the work currently performed by NCAR,” the statement said.

The foundation also said that it will publish a Dear Colleague letter that will “inform the agency’s follow-on actions” and that it will explore options to “transfer stewardship” of NCAR’s supercomputer to “to an appropriate operator.”

It also plans to “divest of or transfer the two NSF aircraft that NCAR manages and operates” and “redefine the scope of modeling and forecasting research and operations to concentrate on needs such as seasonal weather prediction, severe storms, and space weather.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Top-Vought_092925_AP_Evan-Vucci.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-18 07:00:52.844508

The NCCP recognises partnership with local government as critical in achieving national climate goals, stating that local government contributions to climate action are nationally significant.

ALGA President Mayor Matt Burnett said: “We are pleased that climate and energy ministers recognise that local governments play key roles in reducing emissions and incorporating climate considerations into how we plan, build and live.”

“Future-proofing communities from the changing climate continues to be a national priority, and Australia’s councils are leading the way by investing heavily in climate resilience solutions,” Mayor Burnett said.

ALGA’s research shows that Australia’s councils are already delivering more than $400 million per year in projects to prepare their communities for the changing climate needs and will invest about $2 billion in adaptation over the next five years.

“We are calling for an Adaptation Fund that councils can rely on, so they can scale up their projects and protect their communities. Enabling local investments supports the resilience of our infrastructure, health system and natural environment to climate impacts across our nation.”

Ministers have also committed to working with councils where decisions affect local communities.

As a wave of data center developers further their plans to set up shop in Michigan, two bipartisan Michigan lawmakers want to repeal the tax breaks that are luring them.

State Rep. Jim DeSana, R-Carleton, announced Tuesday during an anti-data center rally at the Capitol that he and Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, are sponsoring a three-bill package to overturn the sales and use tax exemptions that lawmakers narrowly approved last session in hopes of enticing tech companies to build massive “hyperscale” data centers in Michigan.

Since then, no fewer than 14 hyperscale proposals have cropped up from west Michigan to metro Detroit, prompting cheers from business leaders and outcry from residents who worry the massive, energy-hungry facilities will despoil communities and strain the power grid.

“I’d like to think that some people are having second thoughts” about their vote to approve the tax breaks, said DeSana.

Still, he predicted the repeal effort would face an uphill battle in the Legislature, given the massive lobbying power of monopoly utilities that stand to ink profitable energy contracts with data center developers.

But DeSana noted that mounting public opposition to the facilities could change political dynamics. Thousands of people have filed public comments opposing Michigan’s first major hyperscale data center proposal in Washtenaw County’s Saline Township, and dozens turned out on the Capitol lawn Tuesday to call for a statewide moratorium on data center development.

Protestors chanted “no secret deals” in objection to DTE Energy’s quest to gain state approval of a 19-year power contract for the Saline Township development without publicly disclosing full terms of the contract.

A DTE spokesperson said that company still was reviewing the proposed tax break elimination and couldn’t comment.

Consumers Energy spokesperson Katie Carey said the utility is “committed to providing reliable, affordable energy that makes growth possible – helping our communities thrive today and for generations to come. Repealing this policy will put Michigan further behind other states and hinder our ability to support Michigan’s economy and long-term growth.”

On farmland in the community south of Ann Arbor, tech giants OpenAI, Oracle and Related Digital plan to build a $7 billion, 1.4-gigawatt Stargate facility that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has hailed as “the largest economic project in Michigan history.”

Other developers far along in the planning process for proposed data centers include Microsoft, which last year purchased two separate plots of industrially zoned land in Kent and Allegan counties, and a Google-connected developer that has received approval to build a six-building facility in Oakland County’s Lyon Township.

The state’s largest utilities, DTE and Consumers Energy, have told investors that, in addition to the Saline Township proposal, they are in late-stage talks with data center developers looking to secure a total of 5 gigawatts of power capacity. That amounts to between four and six average-sized hyperscale facilities. If all come to fruition, Michigan’s peak energy demand could surge 39%.

But for seemingly every newly announced proposal recently, a proposed project has been cancelled or postponed as local communities fight the massive developments.

Opponents fear lost farmland and destroyed habitat, noise pollution from thousands of humming servers, strain on the electric grid and higher bills as utilities spend mightily on infrastructure to power the facilities, and strain on rivers and aquifers amid data centers’ use of water to cool servers.

“Our resources are at risk,” said Kathryn Haushalter, who lives next to the property slated for the Stargate facility. Rather than selling too, she promised to “stay and fight” the development.

In Howell Township, public outcry and a newly passed moratorium on data centers prompted developers to withdraw a proposal to rezone farmland for a $1 billion facility. Project backers said in a Facebook post they wanted to “give the Township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers.”

Proposals in Kalkaska and in Monroe County’s Dundee Township were similarly shelved amid public pushback.

The churn of announcements and cancellations also points to the speculative nature of the data center business. Developers often pitch their plans in multiple communities, but only move forward in the community that presents the quickest pathway to approval, said Douglas Jester, managing partner at the energy consulting firm 5 Lakes Energy.

“It’s very clear that data centers are shopping for locations,” Jester said Tuesday during a forum hosted by the Michigan State University Institute for Public Policy & Social Research.

As opposition to the facilities mounts, several local governments have placed preemptive moratoriums on data center development, aiming to give local leaders time to craft regulations dictating where and how the industry can set up shop.

Beyond tax breaks, Michigan’s climate, abundant water and excess capacity on its utility grid make the state appealing to data center developers, said Dong Zhao, a Michigan State University associate professor of construction management and civil engineering who spoke during Tuesday’s forum.

“We have energy and we have water and we have the cold weather,” which can help dissipate the heat generated by running thousands of computers 24/7, he said.

Data center advocates argue the industry can bring needed benefits to Michigan, such as new revenue to help cover the costs of poles, wires and pipes that deliver electricity and water. Many communities are struggling to maintain their utility infrastructure after decades of industrial decline left systems overbuilt and underfunded.

Officials in the Benton Harbor area, for instance, have said they hope to lure a data center to bolster the customer base of a water system that struggles to cover basic maintenance after the closure of large factories that once helped pay the bills.

Officials in Augusta Township, likewise, say they have plenty of water to supply a proposed data center because the water system was built to provide millions of gallons a day to a since-closed General Motors plant.

If contracts are structured appropriately, data center developments can bring similar benefits to electricity customers, said Lucas Fykes, energy policy director for the Data Center Coalition, an industry lobbying group.

“As you add on large-load customers, you’re able to spread out those fixed costs,” Fykes said. “It puts downward pressure on rates for all the other residential customers.”

The Saline Township proposal

Utility regulators on the Michigan Public Service Commission could decide within days whether to approve power contracts for the Saline Township data center.

DTE Energy is seeking ex parte approval of a 19-year deal to supply power to the facility.

Utility officials contend that the data center will pay for more than its fair share of utility costs, resulting in $300 million in annual savings for other customers. They have urged commissioners to swiftly approve the contracts, warning that their agreement with project developers includes the option for the developers to terminate the project if power isn’t secured by Dec. 19.

The commission’s next meeting is Thursday, Dec. 18.

“Our discussions with the developer and customer have indicated they need to start construction at the beginning of the year to move forward with the project site,” DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot told Bridge Michigan last month.

Ratepayer advocacy groups, environmentalists and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel have urged commissioners to instead open up a so-called contested case, a lengthy review process that would allow deeper public scrutiny of the proposed deal. They contend the publicly available version of DTE’s application is so heavily redacted, it’s impossible to know whether it’s a good deal for ratepayers.

Holding up an oversized version of the blacked-out document during Tuesday’s protest, Nessel asked the crowd, “Does that seem transparent to you?

“We’re not asking the Public Service Commission just to completely destroy this project,” Nessel said. “We just want to know … what the hell is going on and what that will mean for the people of our state.”

In addition to the utility contract, developers need permits from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to install diesel-powered backup generators and begin construction activities that would impact wetlands and the Saline River.

Data center opponents are mobilizing to fight the wetlands request, citing “red flags,” including potential harm to endangered species, destruction of wetlands and what they say is insufficient proof that the data center’s stormwater discharge won’t pollute the Saline River.

“EGLE and EPA staff are under undue influence from state and federal administrations to approve these permits quickly, without proper due diligence, and without regard for proper regulatory compliance,” states a release from the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance of Michigan.

State environmental regulators have said there’s no firm timeline for when they will decide whether to grant the environmental permits, but the process could take several months.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iStock-160559367.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:23.941098

Timely and Efficient Compliance EPA staff are directed to focus on rapid resolution of violations, with compliance – not punishment – as the North Star.
Legal disputes over novel or ambiguous regulatory interpretations should be elevated to national leadership, potentially providing regulated entities with a new escalation pathway.","On December 5, 2025, Craig J. Pritzlaff, Acting Assistant Administrator of the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), issued an internal memorandum instituting a “Compliance First” approach, immediately effective for all civil enforcement and compliance activities. This memo claims to introduce a policy shift: prioritizing timely and effective compliance over punitive enforcement and expansive regulatory interpretations. EPA’s goal is clear, swift, and efficient compliance, achieved by the “clearest, most defensible interpretations of our statutory and regulatory mandates.”

Key Elements of the “Compliance First” Policy

Compliance Assistance Toolkit

Enforcement is not the only tool. Proactive outreach, technical assistance, voluntary audits, and self-reporting are highlighted as means to encourage regulated entities to “find and fix” issues before enforcement becomes necessary.

State and Tribal Coordination

The EPA is committed to deferential, collaborative engagement with authorized states and tribes. Civil enforcement activities will avoid duplication and promote consistency by coordinating closely with local agencies, providing them with technical support, and ensuring states lead where they have primary jurisdiction.

Transparent Communication and “No Surprises”

Open, transparent dialogue is mandated throughout inspections and enforcement. The EPA pledges a “no surprises” approach and wants regulated entities to proactively identify and address potential compliance issues, building trust, and avoiding unexpected enforcement escalation.

Clarity and Legal Precision in Findings

Findings of violation must be “clear and unambiguous” and based on the “best reading” of statutes and regulations. Expansive or creative interpretations that create uncertainty or deviate from precedent are expressly rejected, especially in light of recent Supreme Court decisions. Material legal ambiguities must be elevated to national EPA leadership for resolution, ensuring consistent application across regions.

Timely and Efficient Compliance

EPA staff are directed to focus on rapid resolution of violations, with compliance – not punishment – as the North Star. Prolonged or punitive strategies are deemphasized to avoid delaying environmental protection and economic operations. Formal enforcement and injunctive relief (such as administrative or judicial action) will be used only when informal or compliance assistance measures are insufficient or in emergencies. Remedies must be narrowly tailored, directly tied to specific violations, and based on clear legal requirements. EPA’s April 26, 2021 memorandum (Using All Appropriate Injunctive Relief Tools in Civil Enforcement Settlements), which focused on expansive injunctive measures and supplemental environmental projects (SEPs), is also rescinded, pending new guidance. OECA Assistant Administrator approval is required for non-standard remedies like third-party audits.

Reasoned, Transparent Decisions Using LEAPS

The memo introduces the LEAPS framework for enforcement decisions:

Law: Use the clearest statutory/regulatory interpretation;

Evidence: Rely on solid, unequivocal facts;

Analysis: Apply logic and connect facts with law;

Programmatic Impact: Consider effects on EPA programs; and

Stakeholder Impact: Assess how actions affect states, tribes, and regulated entities

The memo states that EPA is aiming for transparent, reasoned decisions anchored in LEAPS to make enforcement predictable and defensible.

Practical Implications for the Regulated Community

Potential for more opportunities for rapid, voluntary compliance and proactive technical assistance.

Legal disputes over novel or ambiguous regulatory interpretations should be elevated to national leadership, potentially providing regulated entities with a new escalation pathway.

Formal remedies such as SEPs and wide-ranging monitoring should be restricted, and enforcement actions should now be both more predictable and tied tightly to statutory requirements.

EPA will soon issue a single guidance document to harmonize enforcement practices agency-wide, offering more clarity and consistency for regulated parties.

Final Thoughts

While this “new” policy shares similarities with prior EPA enforcement guidance and does not create legally binding rights, the intent appears to portray a shift in EPA enforcement philosophy to prioritizing clarity, efficiency, and cooperation over adversarial posturing or creative statutory interpretations. While it is too early to know what practical implications this will have for enforcement actions, EPA’s memo is a helpful reminder for regulated entities to review their compliance programs, prepare for inspections, and document legal positions carefully to align with the “best reading” standard now embedded in EPA practice.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16139_0319.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 00:00:25.525657

Entergy Louisiana is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation (NYSE: ETR), an integrated Entergy company engaged in electric power production, transmission and retail distribution operations.
Headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, Entergy has annual revenues of $10 billion and approximately 12,000 employees.","WEST FELICIANA PARISH, La. – Hut 8, an energy infrastructure platform integrating power, digital infrastructure and computing at scale to fuel next-generation, energy-intensive use cases, announced it will develop the River Bend artificial intelligence (AI) data center campus in Southeast Louisiana. The project represents a up to $10 billion investment in Phase I, including Hut 8’s investment in data center infrastructure.

At the peak of construction on Phase I, Hut 8 anticipates approximately 1,000 construction workers on-site. Once operational, Phase I of the River Bend campus is expected to create at least 75 direct new jobs with employment expected to expand significantly as future phases of the campus are developed. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 193 indirect new jobs, for a total of 268 potential new job opportunities in the Capital Region.

“Louisiana continues to win,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “Hut 8’s investment in River Bend builds on our track record of attracting global-scale projects in the industries of the future. As the campus grows, it will further cement Louisiana’s position as a national leader in energy and innovation, creating thousands of jobs and reaffirming our ability to compete and win on the global stage.”

Fluidstack, supported by a financial backstop from Google covering all lease and related pass-through obligations, will be a tenant at the site, which has the potential to scale to up to 1,000 MW of utility capacity, and positions Louisiana as a long-term hub for high-performance computing infrastructure.

“River Bend is a testament to the power of partnership,” Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said. “This project was made possible by the leadership of state and local leaders, the commitment of Entergy, and the determination of the people of Louisiana. Together, we will build infrastructure that supports the world’s most advanced technological applications at scale while setting a standard for how utilities, governments, and innovators can drive lasting economic and technological progress.”

Hut 8 tapped Entergy Louisiana to provide an initial 330 megawatts (MW) of utility capacity to support 245 MW of critical IT load for Fluidstack, a leading AI cloud platform for training and inference. This agreement was contemplated in Entergy’s more recent outlooks provided in November 2025.

“Energy is one of Louisiana’s greatest competitive advantages,” President and CEO of Entergy Louisiana Phillip May said. “Our ability to deliver reliable, scalable power while maintaining some of the lowest electricity rates in the country gives companies like Hut 8 the confidence to invest here, fueling economic growth and creating long-term value for our customers and communities.”

The State of Louisiana has positioned itself as a premier destination for global-scale projects like River Bend through a competitive portfolio of incentive programs. Hut 8 is expected to participate in Louisiana’s state and local sales and use tax rebate on qualifying purchases or leases of data center equipment, established in Act 730 of the 2024 Regular Legislative Session. Hut 8 also plans to participate in the state’s Quality Jobs program.

“River Bend demonstrates that Louisiana’s economic strategy is taking our state from plans to progress,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “This project will generate high-wage jobs and create pathways for Louisianans to build long-term careers in the industries of the future. It’s a clear example of how aligning policy, partnership and people translates into lasting opportunity.”

Construction on the data center is already underway with operations expected to commence by the second quarter of 2027.

“West Feliciana Parish is proud to welcome Hut 8 and River Bend to our community,” said Parish President Kenny Havard. “This is a once-in-a-generation project that will bring jobs, opportunity, and investment to our parish for decades to come. It shows what’s possible when local, state, and industry partners work together toward a shared vision of growth and progress.”

Hut 8’s River Bend campus builds on Louisiana’s momentum of landmark economic development projects over the past year that have reshaped the state’s economy and strengthening its global competitiveness. In the past year, Louisiana has secured milestone investments including Meta’s $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana and Hyundai Steel Company’s nearly $6 billion investment to establish its first North American manufacturing facility in Donaldsonville.

Over 30 people from the Seattle area and beyond, all volunteers with Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), joined a nationwide lobbying push the week of Nov. 17–21 to urge support for affordable clean energy and promote a policy that combats wildfire risk. CCL is a national, nonpartisan, grassroots nonprofit dedicated to growing the political will for a liveable world.

Americans, including households in Washington State, are increasingly experiencing rising electricity costs driven by escalating climate extremes and the rapid growth of energy-intensive data centers.

At the same time, we have seen firsthand the impacts of a changing climate – forest fires making the air unhealthy to breathe, unprecedented heat waves, impacts on seasonal rainfall and snow pack, droughts in key agricultural regions, and flooding—underscoring the need for policies to address the climate crisis.

During meetings with the offices of Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell as well as 9 out of 10 Washington Representatives, citizen lobbyists from across the state appealed for Congressional action to fast-track comprehensive, bi-partisan energy permitting reform to get more affordable clean electricity onto the grid as the cost of living skyrockets. More than 95% of the projects awaiting permits are clean energy.

According to the Clean Energy Power Association:

“Today, the average timeline for a project to obtain necessary National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews is 4.5 years. For transmission projects, the average timeline is even longer – 6.5 years.”

CCL advocated for comprehensive, bipartisan, permitting reform and pointed to the Problem Solvers Caucus’ Framework for Permitting Reform as a good start on the policies that could be in such a bill.

CCL volunteers also promoted the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA, S.1462), a bill that recently passed the Senate Agriculture Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 18-5. It would ensure U.S. forests are well-maintained and resilient in the face of increasing wildfires. Wildfire smoke contributes to the deaths of about 40,000 people a year in the U.S., according to a study by Nature. Alarmingly, that number is projected to rise to 70,000 people by 2050.

A previous version of FOFA passed the House (H.R.471) 279-141 in January. CCL believes that the Senate version is even stronger and has earned the endorsements of important environmental groups, including National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, and of course, CCL. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), one of the Senate bill’s co-sponsors said, “As increasingly frequent and catastrophic wildfires in California make clear, we need durable solutions to confront the growing impacts of the wildfire crisis.”

“Burien and every local neighborhood will benefit if Congress passes bi-partisan permitting reform and forest health laws that lead to more affordable electricity and air less polluted by wildfire smoke,” said Larry Steele, a CCL liaison to Senator Murray who lives in Des Moines and who met with her staff this week.

“These issues make sense to a lot of people, so support is growing for bi-partisan action in Congress. This is a great time for people to message our Senators and Representatives to show support for cheaper energy, clean air, and protection for the forests we love.”

“It’s exciting to exercise the skills of democracy at such a turbulent time,” Steele added. “The opportunity to talk directly with our representatives and their staff feels very empowering. I was amazed that CCL can take ordinary concerned citizens like me and train them to do something so important.”

Prior to lobby meetings, local volunteers with Citizens’ Climate Lobby attended CCL’s virtual Fall Conference on Nov. 14–15, featuring empowering speakers and training opportunities to build common ground across political divides.

“CCL’s willingness to reach across divides and build bridges is what sets us apart, and we’re needed more than ever these days,” said Ricky Bradley, CCL’s Interim Executive Director. “I’m excited about the ways we will help move the conversation forward on clean energy through federal permitting reform, and I’m proud of our ongoing commitment to do this work in a nonpartisan way.”

Nationwide, CCL volunteers have generated tens of thousands of messages and calls this year urging Congress to advance durable, bipartisan climate policies.",https://b-townblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SKM-CitizensClimateLobbyLogo25.avif,N,,2025-12-18 01:08:11.568562

The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

Everyone — politicians and the public — is talking about energy costs. In particular, they’re talking about data centers that drive artificial intelligence systems and their increasing energy demand, electricity costs and strain on the nation’s already overloaded energy grid.

As a former state energy official and utility executive, I know that many of the underlying questions involving energy affordability are very complex and have been festering for decades, in part because of how many groups are involved. Energy projects are expensive and take a long time to build. Where to build them is often also a difficult, even controversial, question. Consumers, regulators, utilities and developers all value energy reliability but have different interests, cost sensitivities and time frames in mind.

The problem of high energy prices is not new, but it is urgent. And it comes at a time when the U.S. is deeply divided on its approaches to energy policy and the politics of solving collective problems.

Rising costs

From September 2024 to September 2025, average U.S. residential electricity prices have risen 7.4%, from 16.8 to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. Government analysts expect prices will continue to rise and outpace inflation in 2026.

With household earnings basically flat when adjusted for inflation, these increases hit consumers hard. They take up higher percentages of household expenses — especially for lower-income households. Electricity prices have effects throughout the economy, both directly on consumers’ budgets and indirectly by raising operating costs for business and industry, which pass them along to customers by raising prices for goods and services.

The problem

By 2030, energy analysts expect U.S. electricity demand to rise about 25%, and McKinsey estimates that data centers’ energy use could nearly triple from current levels by that year, using as much as 11.7% of all electricity in the U.S. — more than double their current share.

The nation’s current electricity grid is not ready to supply all that energy. And even if the electricity could be generated, transmission lines are aging and not up to carrying all that power. Their capacity would need to be expanded by about 60% by 2050.

Orders of key generating equipment often face multiyear delays. And construction of new and expanded transmission lines has been very slow.

A Brattle Group analysis estimates all that new and upgraded equipment could cost between US$760 billion and $1.4 trillion in the next 25 years.

The reasons

The enormous scale of the work needed is a result of a lack of investment over time and delays in the investments that have been made.

For instance, since at least 2011 there has been an effort to bring Canadian hydropower to the New England electricity grid. Political opposition to cutting a path for a transmission line through forestland meant the project was subjected to a statewide referendum in Maine — and then a court case that overturned the referendum results. During those delays, inflation raised the estimated price of the project by half, from $1 billion to $1.5 billion — an added cost that will be paid by Massachusetts electricity customers.

That multiyear effort is just one example of how the vast web of companies that generate power, transmit it from power plants to communities, and distribute it to homes and businesses complicates attempts to make changes to the power grid.

State and federal government agencies have roles in these processes. States’ public utilities commissions oversee the utility companies that distribute power to customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversees connections of power generators to the grid and the transmission lines that move electricity across state lines.

Often, those efforts aren’t aligned with each other, leading to delays over jurisdiction and decision-making.

For instance, as new generators prepare to operate, whether they are solar farms or gas-fired power plants, they need permission from FERC to connect to the transmission grid. The commission typically requests technical engineering studies to determine how the project would affect the existing system. Delays in this process increase the timeline and cost of development and postpone adding new capacity to the grid.

The costs

A key question for regulators and consumers alike is who should pay for adding more electricity to the grid and making the system more reliable.

Utilities traditionally charge customers for the costs of generating and delivering power. And it’s not clear how much power the data centers will ultimately require.

Some large data centers have taken to paying to build their own on-site power plants, though often they can supply energy to the grid as well.

In some states, efforts have begun to address public concern about electricity bills. In November 2025, two utility commissioners in Georgia, who had consistently approved electricity rate hikes over the previous two years, were voted out of office in a landslide.

New Jersey’s Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill has pledged to declare a utility-price emergency and freeze costs for a year.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul has paused implementation of state law, driven by environmental concerns, requiring that all new buildings over seven stories tall only use electricity and not natural gas or other energy sources. Hochul has said that requirement would increase electricity demand too much, raising prices and making the grid less stable.

In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey has filed legislation seeking to provide energy affordability, including eliminating some charges from utility bills, capping bill increases and barring utility companies from charging customers for advertisement costs.

The solutions

Clearly, there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to this complex situation.

However, innovation in regulation, combined with new technologies and even AI itself, may enable creative regulatory and technical solutions. For instance, devices that can be programmed to use energy efficiently, time-sensitive pricing and demand monitoring to smooth out peaks and valleys in electricity use can potentially ease both grid load and customers’ bills. But those solutions will work only if all the players are willing to cooperate.

There are a lot of ideas about how to lower the public’s burden of paying for data centers’ power. New ideas like this need careful scrutiny and possible revisions to ensure they are effective at lowering costs and increasing reliability.

As the country grapples with the effort to upgrade the grid, perform long-deferred maintenance and build new power plants, consumers’ costs are likely to continue to rise, further increasing pressure on Americans. Existing regulations and government oversight may no longer lower electricity costs immediately or help people plan for the rising costs over the long term.

For example, the United States typically welcomes between 25 million and 30 million real Christmas trees each holiday season, and each one reflects years of care.
In Oregon’s Willamette Valley, North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, and across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Christmas growers nurture trees for nearly a decade before harvest.
The result is a steady, well paced logistics environment that helps holiday tree markets in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee flourish.
The entire system closes the year with a sense of renewal rather than waste, reinforcing the positive environmental value of real Christmas trees.","Every December, Christmas trees do more than brighten our living rooms and anchor memorable family traditions. They set in motion a vibrant seasonal economy that energizes farms, retailers, transportation companies, and even segments of the construction industry. The holiday tree supply chain is fast, coordinated, and remarkably spirited, connecting tree growers, rural providers, busy logistics hubs, and joyful cities in one of the most cheerful commercial rhythms of the year. What looks like a simple holiday symbol is a nice story of craftsmanship, teamwork, and wintertime momentum across multiple sectors.

For example, the United States typically welcomes between 25 million and 30 million real Christmas trees each holiday season, and each one reflects years of care. In Oregon’s Willamette Valley, North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, and across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Christmas growers nurture trees for nearly a decade before harvest. These farms rely on wood products not just at the end of the cycle, but throughout it. Wooden stakes help young trees grow straight and strong, racks and pallets crafted from pine and hardwoods transport them to market, and lumber-framed stands welcome customers at retail lots. The entire journey has a warm, hands-on feel — an intersection of agriculture and woodworking that fits perfectly with the spirit of the season.

What makes this annual movement remarkable is how smoothly it integrates into winter business cycles. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, massive tree shipments often align with a natural tapering of outdoor construction activity as weather cools. Many transportation carriers pivot from moving heavy building materials to helping deliver holiday trees, creating an efficient seasonal flow that keeps trucks, drivers, and distribution centers productive during the transition from late fall to winter. Rather than competing, these industries complement each other for a few weeks, balancing freight demand in a way that keeps the regional economy humming.

In the Upper Midwest, the winter season creates an especially harmonious pattern. As temperatures drop in states like Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, outdoor construction helps free up some of the trucking capacity that tree farms need most. It’s a positive synergy, while some people and even some businesses shift toward indoor renovation work, transportation companies stay busy through tree shipments, and local retailers receive their seasonal inventory right on time. The result is a steady, well paced logistics environment that helps holiday tree markets in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee flourish.

The Southeast brings a different but equally encouraging dynamic. North Carolina, home to the popular Fraser fir, supplies millions of trees to states such as Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee. Construction activity remains strong in these regions during December, yet the coordination between tree growers, transportation companies, and large retailers has grown incredibly efficient. Many carriers build Christmas tree shipments into their holiday scheduling each year, ensuring that deliveries arrive fresh, consistent, and ready for families to bring home. Major retailers like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards, Costco, Target and Walmart have developed highly polished seasonal systems, including dedicated pallet inventories, specialized staging areas, and coordinated distribution plans. It’s an impressive display of planning that showcases how well American retail logistics adapt to holiday traditions.

These big box retailers are a particularly important part of the uplifting story. They become lively community hubs during December, not only in tree sales but in the shared sense of excitement as families pick the tree that will define their holiday memories. Behind the scenes, these retailers collaborate with growers and pallet manufacturers to ensure everything arrives safely and beautifully displayed. Pallet yards increase production in November, sawmills supply the softwood needed for racks and stands, and distribution centers transform into cheerful staging grounds full of fresh seasonal fragrance. It is one of the rare moments each year when an entire supply chain feels connected to something joyful.

Weather, which often poses challenges for construction, adds a positive seasonal rhythm to the Christmas tree economy. Northern states naturally shift toward different projects or year end planning as snow begins to fall, yet this frees time, talent, and trucks that can redirect into holiday commerce. Southern states benefit from mild winters that allow both construction and Christmas tree deliveries to proceed smoothly. Even snowy regions often turn winter weather into a festive advantage, families bundle up, head to tree lots for hot cocoa and fresh evergreens, and retail centers feel more alive with holiday energy.

The end of the holiday season also brings a thoughtful, eco-friendly cycle that highlights the industry’s sustainability. Different towns and cities across the country collect millions of trees in early January for recycling, mulching, and composting. Many communities turn these trees into material used for parks, gardens, wildlife habitats, and erosion control projects. The wood infrastructure used in shipping, pallets, racks, and stakes, is often reused or repurposed, creating another layer of efficiency. The entire system closes the year with a sense of renewal rather than waste, reinforcing the positive environmental value of real Christmas trees.

At the same time, the construction industry enters the new year with fresh budgets and a renewed sense of momentum. As tree farms wind down their season, building suppliers ramp up deliveries for January starts, and transportation companies transition smoothly into their next busy cycle. Rather than creating conflicts, the seasonal tide and flow between construction and Christmas tree logistics helps stabilize staffing, freight demand, and revenue across multiple industries during what could otherwise be a slower winter period.

When viewed through this lens, the Christmas tree industry becomes far more than a charming holiday tradition. It is a vibrant seasonal engine that supports growers, sawmills, pallet makers, drivers, distribution centers, retailers, and construction adjacent suppliers. It brings rural and urban communities together, strengthens local economies, and adds warmth to one of the coldest times of year. What begins as a small seedling on a hillside eventually becomes a centerpiece in a family’s home and along the way, it boosts industries, powers logistics networks, and creates a positive, collaborative rhythm that defines December commerce.

In many ways, the Christmas tree is an uplifting intersection of wood, construction, and holiday celebration. Its journey reflects care, planning, teamwork, and craftsmanship, reminding us that the best parts of the holiday season often grow quietly behind the scenes, connecting people and industries in ways we don’t often stop to appreciate.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2025-08/large-Robit-PLC-img-2022-Felipe-Martinez-001-MBN.jpg?h=da92c94c&itok=hkHCKp7_,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:07.599171

At Climate Week NYC in October, climate tech investors, entrepreneurs and other leaders seemed energized after a bruising several months.","The cleantech carnage is piling up, with canceled projects, solar bankruptcies and corporate write-downs amid gale-force policy headwinds.

But survivors among clean-energy developers and energy efficiency retrofitters, along with makers of electric vehicles, batteries and building electrification tech, already are regrouping. They are being buoyed by falling costs, investor interest and the surprisingly durable momentum of the clean energy transition.

On Wednesday, a US federal appeals court even breathed new life into the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a legacy of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act that sought to stand up a network of green lenders that could reach deep into underserved communities. The funds have been frozen in Citibank accounts since the Trump administration tried to claw back the funds and cancel the program in February.

“Everyone deserves access to financing for clean energy projects that create good jobs, reduce pollution, and lower energy bills,” said Beth Bafford of Climate United, which had received the largest chunk of GGRF funding to finance community solar, energy retrofits, electric buses and other green projects in low-income communities.

A full slate of judges on the US District Court of Appeals will reconsider the case at a hearing in February. By a 2-1 vote, the appeals court in September had overturned a district court’s ruling in April that had issued, and immediately stayed, an injunction ordering the Trump administration to unfreeze the funds.

The reprieve came as clean energy investors and entrepreneurs are picking themselves up from a deeply dispiriting year. The nonprofit E2 estimates that at least $30 billion in investments, across 52 projects, have been lost since the Trump administration came into office in January. That doesn’t include collateral damage such as this week’s nearly $20 billion writedown by Ford Motor Co. Ford cited reduced demand for electric vehicles – including the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup – after the end of federal tax credits and the rollback of federal fuel standards.

A spate of high profile solar companies, from Sunnova to Mosaic to Brookfield-backed Posigen, have gone bust. The Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office is retooling $40 billion in loans and guarantees that were helping promising climate tech startups commercialize their innovative technologies and build first-of-a-kind plants to focus on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Many of the loans extended under the Biden administration have been rescinded.

Without US leadership, the COP30 global climate talks in Brazil this fall whimpered to a close.

As we wrote a year ago, “After four years of tailwinds, climate investors are about to see what they can accomplish in the face of gale-force headwinds.”

Project pipelines

To pick up the pieces, entrepreneurs are looking to cut fat out of business models, and investors are mobilizing new funds and coalitions to step into the gap left by the disappearance of public funding.

Green lenders, community developers and clean energy financiers had long claimed that many projects in their pipelines remain economically viable even without the federal incentives. They’re now combing through their pipelines of projects in community solar, building decarbonization, truck and school bus electrification and other green solutions to identify those that can be moved forward without the infusion of federal funding, as ImpactAlpha explored on an Agents of Impact Call in June.

Helping out are a slate of new funds with catalytic or flexible capital that could stand in for some of the government support. After months of closed door discussions, Energy Catalyst Fund I kicked off late this year with $50 million from the MacArthur Foundation and five family offices. The fund, managed by ImpactAssets, will make low-interest loans to advance green projects in low-income communities orphaned by the federal funding freeze.

“The need for energy financing has never been greater, with many projects requiring immediate funding to deliver an abundant energy future for everyone,” ImpactAssets’ Margret Trilli wrote in the firm’s year-end impact report.

The Deployment Grant Fund was launched in July by The Clean Fight, Builders Vision and Breakthrough Energy Ventures to accelerate deployment of climate solutions. The fund awarded a $175,000 grant to Texas-based geothermal startup Bedrock Energy to pioneer the adoption of its “geothermal-as-a-service” business model. A second grant of $125,000 went to Kelvin, a New York-based heating startup, to demonstrate the cost-effective electrification of an affordable housing complex in Brooklyn.

Both grants are matched by the customer with a mix of tax credits, local government grants, customer funding and private capital. “One of the most impactful uses of these small-dollar grants is unlocking additional funding to support projects,” The Clean Fight’s Kate Frucher told ImpactAlpha.

Among the most ambitious responses was the launch of the All Aboard Coalition, a group of top-tier climate venture capital firms organized by TED curator Chris Anderson to make bets on leading climate tech startups. The dozen or so coalition members, including Khosla Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, Obvious Ventures, and S2G Investments, will co-invest in geothermal, energy storage, marine decarbonization and other climate tech solutions that attract funding from two or more of the VCs.

The idea is to pool funds to help promising startups get through the tricky commercialization phase, often referred to as the “valley of death,” and to signal confidence to other big investors.

“We need a few people to join forces and be bold together, and the returns that we’ll get from that will be remarkable,” Anderson told ImpactAlpha earlier this year.

The coalition had hoped to clinch the $300 million fund by the end of October and make the first co-investments before the end of the year; it now expects both of those milestones to take place in January.

As ImpactAlpha exclusively reported, one of the recipients of Greenhouse Gas Reduction funds managed to get at least some money out the door before funds were frozen. The green bank network CGC, formerly known as the Coalition for Green Capital, was awarded $5 billion. In late January, CGC moved $2.7 billion to Apollo, Brookfield, Energy Capital Partners and a fourth investment firm, before the Environmental Protection Agency managed to freeze the bulk of the GGRF awards. The first deals from the four strategic partners are expected to come in early 2026.

CGC also invested $200 million in insurance firm Greenie Re to facilitate insurance coverage for renewable energy projects.

Climate United, which had sought to stand up a network of green lenders that could reach deep into underserved communities, has kept its door open with philanthropic funding while the lengthy litigation continues to play out.

At Climate Week NYC in October, climate tech investors, entrepreneurs and other leaders seemed energized after a bruising several months.

“I’m hoping that this is a helpful week to kind of get people back focused on deploying, on allocating money to these sectors and realizing that this is not a lost cause,” Bafford said at the time. “There is still a lot of great opportunity.”

Contrarian bets

The withdrawal of federal funding and incentives had the counterintuitive effect of increasing the appeal of climate investments for private investors.

“Times like these in history, for us, have actually presented the very best times to be investing,” Colin le Duc, a founding partner of Generation Investment Management, the $30 billion sustainable asset manager whose other co-founders include Al Gore and David Blood, told ImpactAlpha. Generation, and its specialized offshoot, Just Climate, see opportunities to scoop up clean tech companies with good management and long-term potential.

“The fundamentals of the sustainability transition are very much intact,” said le Duc. “We’re increasingly making the case that you really want to work with a specialist who’s got a long term mindset to seize this opportunity, because this is a long term secular shift.”

Other investors also see opportunity amid the federal pullback.

“If you’re sitting there with cash, it’s an unequivocally good thing, because prices are going to be lower, there’s going to be less competition, and you’re going to get better returns,” Galvanize Climate Solutions Tom Steyer told ImpactAlpha

Steyer, who has taken a leave from Galvanize to run for governor of California, has set up a broad-based climate investment strategy at Galvanize, spanning venture capital, private credit, sustainable infrastructure, real estate and public equities.

Chris Creed, the former chief investment office of the Loan Programs Office, joined Gavanize to launch a new sustainable infrastructure strategy earlier this year. “[Energy] Secretary Chris Wright and his team have been very clear as to their priorities,” Creed said at a recent conference. Those priorities are narrowly focused on a handful of energy sources, such as nuclear energy, oil and gas, and geothermal.

“That means my old pipeline of all of the other technologies in our taxonomy are not priorities, and they become investable options for private investors like us,” he added. Creed sees an opportunity to pick up and restructure some of the abandoned LPO loans, he told ImpactAlpha.

Rise of the rest

If US climate investors are swimming against the tide, the rest of the world is riding the rising demand and declining cost curves for renewable energy to a greener future.

At the COP30 global climate summit in Brazil in November, more than 80 countries, including most of Europe, backed a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels. The final agreement included only a reference to the “UAE Consensus,” where countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels.

Nonetheless, China is supplying its low-cost solar modules, EVs and batteries to eager buyers across Africa, Latin America and Europe. The Chinese automaker BYD, for Build Your Dreams, surpassed Tesla to become the world’s largest EV manufacturer.

India is seeking to halve its greenhouse gas emissions and increase its renewable energy production to 500 gigawatts by 2030, up from around 195 gigawatts last year. It is subsidizing households and offering tax advantages similar to those in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act in the US. India’s investment community is looking to create green jobs as it decarbonizes.

“That should be our focus – growth in jobs with clean technology,” India’s G20 representative, Amitabh Kant, said at last month’s gathering of the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association in Delhi.

Europe and the UK have taken on the role of defending climate progress, although the bloc faces its own fractious politics and pressure to backtrack.

Distributed solar generation, from pay-as-you-go solar panels to community solar projects, are addressing longstanding energy gaps in rural emerging markets. In Latin America, investors and innovators are capitalizing on the region’s deep roots to nature with solutions that draw on reforestation, regenerative farming, and bio-based alternatives to harmful products.

Just Climate launched its natural capital strategy, which raised $375 million in November, in Brazil. As the firm’s Eduardo Mufarej explained, “If you’re in the fashion business, you need to be in Paris or in Milan. If you’re in the climate business, you need to be in Latam.”

Just Climate leans into ‘natural’ strategies, with a Latin flavor

An analysis by Reciprocal and Breakthrough Energy Discovery identified 770 startups driving climate innovation, from smart lithium extraction in Chile to bio-based fertilizers in Brazil to satellite-driven biodiversity monitoring platforms in Colombia.

Such economic development opportunities increasingly are driving climate action, rather than a focus on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Some 63 million small businesses in India alone, account for more than one-quarter of the country’s total power consumption and represent an untapped $9 billion market for 15 gigawatts of installed solar capacity.

Globally, small and mid-sized businesses account for 90% of businesses globally, contribute more than half of global GDP, and sustain the livelihoods of two billion people annually.

“Across all of the climate solutions we’ve mapped out, small businesses are leading the way,” Climate Finance Fund’s Marilyn Waite, founder of the Global Climate Finance Forum, said at a side event at COP30. “And yet, they are left out of accessing the capital needed to scale their operations to have the most impact.”

In a guest post on ImpactAlpha, Waite’s colleague at the Global Climate Finance Forum, Meghna Parameswaran, cited startups such as Courageous Land, which has mobilized $35 million to scale biodiverse agroforestry across some 389,000 acres in Brazil, and the Vermi-Farm Initiative, which supports thousands of Kenyan smallholder farmers with climate-smart, waste-to-fertilizer practices, as “demonstrating what effective, frontline climate action looks like.”

Parameswaran argued for tailored blended finance instruments, technical and investor-readiness support, quality data, and support for small businesses in national climate frameworks. “We can cultivate the enabling environment these businesses need to scale their impact.”

Cost curves

A silver lining may be a renewed focus on creating viable business models that can stand on their own, with or without subsidies — as climate tech founders and investors have long insisted they have.

The falling cost of photovoltaic panels, for example, can make residential solar systems a financial win for homeowners even without the federal subsidies (many states continue to offer their own incentives). In the US, the median installation cost per watt of residential solar panels, before incentives, fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.53 last year, according to EnergySage.

The “soft” costs for residential solar systems could be cut further through streamlined permitting processes and direct-to-consumer loan products that eliminate the “dealer fees” that were often hidden in residential solar loan agreements. Those fees often padded costs by as much as 30%, so cutting them out would essentially offset the loss of federal solar tax credits.

“You’ve got that 30% tax credit that’s essentially eaten up by a dealer fee that can be 20%, 30% or more,” said Bill Paulen, CEO of Seattle-based LoanTERRA, which launched in October to help credit unions and other lenders make their own direct-to-consumer solar loans, without dealer fees. “This is too big of an opportunity, and there’s too much opportunity to clean up the financing in this industry.”

Similarly, the high cost of direct air capture technology, or DAC, is slowing the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. But In Berkeley, Calif., Aircapture is doing a thriving business capturing carbon dioxide from the air and selling it to industrial customers of CO2 for use in carbonated beverages, greenhouses, refrigeration, medical equipment and concrete.

“We’re going to market first into the merchant market, where prices are often high, where customers need a more reliable, higher parity supply,” Aircapture’s Matt Atwood told ImpactAlpha. “We think our go to market approach is the right way to be the low cost provider of this technology at scale when the infrastructure is mature.”",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2399599623-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 22:00:34.521799
,EPA,2025-12-18 02:18:57+00:00,The Columbus Dispatch,Data centers could dispose of water in Ohio lakes if state EPA approves,Maria DeVito,,,,,https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/environment/2025/12/17/data-centers-water-lakes-streams-ohio-epa-reviewing/87799939007/,"""If you're really concerned about our safety, safety comes first – not economic values that the data centers are going to promise us,"" said Barry Blankenship, who has opposed a data center in Trenton, Butler County.
""Because I can tell you, our lives are more important than a data center.""
Of the more than 200 data centers in the Buckeye State, only one – an Amazon Web Service data center in Fayette County – is currently on a similar permit.
Under this permit, OEPA says both wastewater and stormwater from such data center facilities would be covered.
But Ariss said OEPA has no information to date that shows water from data centers contains PFAS.","As Ohio's data center boom continues, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency is considering a permit to allow new data centers without access to central sewerage systems to dispose of water used to cool servers directly into lakes, rivers and streams.

The Ohio EPA on Dec. 17 held a public hearing on the proposed permit at its downtown Columbus office with about 25 people in attendance and another 100 people watching online. Nearly a dozen people who attended in person spoke, and several specifically were concerned about language in the the draft permit proposal that states lowering water quality ""is necessary to accommodate important social and economic development in the state of Ohio.""

""If you're really concerned about our safety, safety comes first – not economic values that the data centers are going to promise us,"" said Barry Blankenship, who has opposed a data center in Trenton, Butler County. ""Because I can tell you, our lives are more important than a data center.""

Kendra McKitrick, a bachelor's in geography graduate of Ohio University's Honors Tutorial College, spoke about growing up in Toledo and remembered a several day period in 2013 when the area was without clean water because of an algae bloom in Lake Erie.

""It was a scary and confusing time for everyone, especially a child, but to come into adulthood to realize those who are supposed to protect our environment are willing to sacrifice clean water for the economic growth of big data is horrifying,"" she said. ""Amidst this technological revolution of the 21st century, it is your responsibility as the EPA to protect our environment.""

The proposed general permit, which would be in effect for five years if approved, would not apply to most data centers in the state, the OEPA says. For example, data centers in central Ohio send their cooling wastewater to the city of Columbus's sanitary sewer system or some other central sewerage treatment provider. The proposed draft permit would apply only to data centers that can't connect to a sewerage system that would treat the cooling wastewater.

Of the more than 200 data centers in the Buckeye State, only one – an Amazon Web Service data center in Fayette County – is currently on a similar permit. But OEPA officials said this general permit, which data center companies would only need to file a notice of intent to tap into if they meet the eligibility requirements, is being done in anticipation of additional future requests because the state has more water line providers than sewer providers.

Under this permit, OEPA says both wastewater and stormwater from such data center facilities would be covered. OEPA says wastewater discharges include non-contact cooling waters that have gone once through the center or been recirculated water without contact with the process operations of a facility and is used only to convey heat from the facility, low volume wastewaters such as, cooling tower blowdown, boiler blowdown, and air compressor condensate [excludes some waste streams like sanitary wastes] and stormwater from industrial activities at the site.

The OEPA has not received other applications for individual permits, but state agency officials have had conversations and fielded questions from different communities across the state about the requirements for data centers, Walter Ariss, national pollutant discharge elimination systems manager at the Ohio EPA, told The Dispatch after the hearing.

""We're trying to be proactive, maybe not reactive to a particular industry that is looking to locate in our state,"" he said.

If the general permit is approved, any data center using it will still have to meet Ohio's water quality standards to discharge water into any surface water body. That means any water released would have to be treated to be cooled down or remove any chemicals that were added, OEPA officials said.

People who spoke during the hearing also raised concerns about PFAS, or forever chemicals, entering Ohio waterways. But Ariss said OEPA has no information to date that shows water from data centers contains PFAS. But he said if that changes in the future, the OEPA can change the conditions of the permit to address it.

The public comment period for the permit was originally slated to end Dec. 17, something that drew criticism from some members of the public who expressed concerns that OEPA was rushing the permitting process through ahead of the holidays. However, the OEPA said it has extended the comment period through Jan. 16.

To date, OEPA has received more than 2,000 comments related to the draft permit, Ohio EPA spokesperson Mary McCarron said during the hearing.

Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) Program.
Long Duration Energy Storage Use Cases: A Primer on Applications to Aid Technology Selection.
Moving Beyond 4-Hour Li-Ion Batteries: Expanding Energy Storage Duration in U.S. Markets.","◇ What is LDES?

According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) refers to technologies capable of discharging for 10 hours or more. As renewable energy grows, the challenge is not only adding solar and wind capacity, but also ensuring reliable power supply when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. LDES technologies are critical to enabling a resilient, decarbonized grid.

◇ Main Categories of LDES Technologies

LDES covers a variety of approaches. Each has its own strengths and limitations.

- Lithium-ion batteries

Today’s most widely used technology, best suited for 2–4 hours of discharge.

Safety and degradation continue to be challenges for longer durations.

- Pumped hydro

Large-scale and proven, but constrained by geography and long permitting times.

- Compressed air & thermal storage

Promising concepts under development, but commercial adoption is still limited.

- Flow batteries

Store energy in liquid electrolytes. Known for long life, safety, and scalability.

→ Sumitomo Electric’s Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) belongs to this category.

- Electrolyte tanks: Store positive and negative electrolytes. Increasing tank size expands total energy capacity (MWh).

- Cell stacks: Pumped electrolytes flow through stacks, where redox reactions occur to generate or store electricity. Adding stacks increases system power (MW).

- Vanadium chemistry: Vanadium can exist in multiple oxidation states, so both electrolytes use the same element. This minimizes cross-contamination and supports long life.

Key Benefits

- Flexible design: Scale power and energy independently.

- Long lifetime: Over 30 years of operation with minimal degradation.

- Safety: Aqueous, non-flammable electrolyte means no thermal runaway risk.

- Sustainability: Electrolyte can be reused and recycled, supporting circular economy goals.

◇ Sumitomo Electric’s Track Record

Sumitomo Electric has been a pioneer in commercializing VRFBs:

- First utility-scale VRFB in the U.S. (San Diego, 2017): 8 MWh system connected to CAISO, serving as a community microgrid with black-start capability.

- Large-scale projects in Japan: 60 MWh (2015) and 51 MWh (2022) systems in Hokkaido, stabilizing wind power integration.

- Global deployment: As of 2025, 49 projects across 7 countries, totaling 52 MW / 190 MWh, with an additional 44 MWh awarded.

Next-Generation VRFB – Lower Cost, Higher Value

- 15% higher energy density → smaller footprint.

- 30% cost reduction through design and manufacturing improvements.

- 30-year lifetime enabled by long-life materials and low-maintenance design.

The DOE has set a cost target for LDES of $0.05/kWh or less. Our next-generation VRFB is designed to help achieve this benchmark.

◇ Why It Matters for the U.S. Market

- LDES stakeholders

Flow batteries, validated through Sumitomo Electric’s global deployments, are among the most technically mature and operationally proven LDES technologies. They deliver long-duration energy at scale with minimal safety risks and little degradation, aligning with DOE’s targets for affordable and reliable storage.

- Utilities

Sumitomo Electric has demonstrated performance through its San Diego project, the first utility-scale VRFB in the U.S. Operating since 2017 on the CAISO grid, it provides peak shaving, renewable firming, black-start capability, and microgrid support, achieving more than 99% availability.

- Remote & Microgrid operators

VRFBs are well-suited for isolated communities and critical facilities, offering safe, non-flammable long-duration backup. In Cameron Corners, California, a 4 MWh system scheduled for operation in 2025 will secure power during Public Safety Power Shutoffs and support black-start functionality to enhance resilience.

- Commercial & Industrial users (C&I)

For commercial and industrial facilities, VRFBs reduce reliance on diesel generators, manage peak demand, and ensure sustainable long-term backup. With lifespans over 20 years and recyclable, non-flammable electrolytes, these systems support both operational continuity and decarbonization goals.

◇ Conclusion

While lithium-ion batteries remain today’s mainstream solution, flow batteries offer the safety, durability, and scalability needed for the future of long-duration energy storage. With decades of experience and continuous innovation, Sumitomo Electric is committed to supporting the U.S. in building a resilient, decarbonized energy system.

“I feel we did a disservice to the people of Louisiana,” Democrat Commissioner Davante Lewis said after the vote.","In a meeting marked by tense moments of disagreement, the Louisiana Public Service Commission on Tuesday approved a new regulatory pathway designed to speed electricity connections for large projects like data centers.

Proponents for the change say it’s necessary for the state to stay competitive and attract major economic development projects. Critics, however, say it weakens long-standing consumer protections and could expose residents to higher utility costs.

In a 3–2 vote during its monthly meeting in Natchitoches, the commission adopted a directive from Republican Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan that allows utilities to bypass the market-based mechanism they’ve used since the 1980s to demonstrate they are pursuing the least-cost power option.

The commission’s decision comes as state leaders actively court additional data centers, projects that could reshape Louisiana’s power grid, land and water use and rate structure for decades to come.

The change aligns with Gov. Jeff Landry’s “Louisiana Lighting Speed Initiative,” an executive order issued in September directing state agencies to streamline permitting and infrastructure decisions tied to economic development.

Supporters say the new pathway will help Louisiana compete for hyperscale data centers by accelerating approvals and providing certainty around power availability.

The directive sets an eight-month timeline for commission action on large-load applications and allows exemptions from market testing if companies meet specific criteria. That criteria includes: signing a 15-year electric service agreement, demonstrating a need for additional capacity, paying at least half the cost of new infrastructure and securing a letter of support from Louisiana Economic Development — an agency that directly supports Gov. Landry’s economic goals and policies.

But consumer advocates and a lone commissioner warned the changes prioritize large utilities like Entergy and corporate customers at the expense of existing ratepayers.

“I feel we did a disservice to the people of Louisiana,” Democrat Commissioner Davante Lewis said after the vote. “I think we tied our hands behind our back, put an eyepatch over one eye and then gave a wink to the utilities and these large hyperscalers with the other eye.”

Lewis had proposed a separate directive that would have launched a broader review of how large electric loads connect to the grid, how costs are allocated and what protections should be in place for existing customers. That proposal was deferred until the commission’s January meeting in a 4-1 vote.

But shortly before that vote, District 4 Commissioner and chair Mike Francis cut Lewis off during his discussion with a consultant, leading to a tense disagreement. Other commissioners could be heard having separate conversations among themselves as Lewis posed a series of questions about the process to develop his proposal and its regulatory intent.

When Lewis began to question the basis of passing Coussan’s directive, Francis intervened to thank the consultant in an apparent attempt to dismiss him. Lewis then told Francis that was unfair, saying other commissioners had been given ample time in the same meeting to speak.

To that, District 1 Commissioner Eric Skrmetta quietly responded, “I didn’t say s---.”

“Let’s just be respectful up here,” Lewis pleaded with his fellow commissioners. “I understand we have a difference of opinion, and I understand you’re going to kill everything I want to do, but let me talk. I’m over the disrespect up here.”

Lewis said his approach was meant to examine the full scope of impacts rather than carve out a single exemption.

“He was a slice of the pie, and I was saying let’s look at the whole pie,” Lewis said, referring to Coussan’s directive. He called the suspended market-based mechanism “one of our most basic protections that we have to the Louisiana ratepayers that has existed since the 1980s,” adding that the Commission “changed it in the blink of an eye.”

Consumer groups echoed those concerns. In a statement following the meeting, Logan Burke of the Alliance for Affordable Energy (AAE) said the directive removes “guardrails meant to ensure regular people don’t shoulder unnecessary costs put onto them by monopoly utility companies and multibillion-dollar corporations.”

Lewis warned that suspending market testing could allow utilities to pursue more expensive generation projects without proving they are the lowest-cost option.

“They have no obligation to come with the least cost option,” he said. “We have now given them pretty much a blank check.”

He also raised concerns about the eight-month approval timeline, noting that the directive does not define what qualifies as a “large load.”

“We could use this process for something as small as 20 megawatts,” Lewis said, “or something as big as 17,000 megawatts,” arguing that a fixed timeline could limit meaningful review of massive projects.

The AAE pointed to ongoing impacts around the Meta data center project in north Louisiana as a cautionary example.

“Residents are already seeing negative impacts from the Meta data center development, including extended power outages, drinking water discoloration and a severe increase in traffic incidents and public safety risks,” said Alaina DiLaura with the group.

Lewis said similar frameworks for large electric loads have been adopted across the political spectrum in other states.

“33 states have either passed some type of rules, or framework or tariffs around these larger loads,” he said. “This is not even a Republican, Democratic thing. This is about consumers.”

Looking ahead to January, Lewis said he plans to push for limits on the new exemption and clearer definitions.

“We should define what a large load is for Louisiana,” he said. “The point of a regulator is to protect consumers. And to just say, ‘Well, we’ll look at that on the back end,’ I think is just a bad way to do regulatory work.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a6ed5d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1776x932+0+126/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F29%2Fa6%2Fe28fc20e40c0b9f08cc83333ff89%2Fdscf1202.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 20:59:02.675512

Economists have mostly been flying blind because of the government shutdown, but this week the data really start to flow again. In particular, we get a partial report on the employment situation in October and a full report for November, retail sales in October, and consumer prices in November.

Combined, October and November employment data will likely show modest continued growth in jobs. If you believe ADP, October will be up and November down; if you believe jobless claims, October will be weak and November better. Either way, it’s important to recognize that given the huge policy shift from lax to strict immigration enforcement, the push by the Trump Administration to thin government payrolls, as well as the ongoing aging of the population and layoffs attributed to AI, payroll growth should be slow.

In the meantime, the retail sales report for October should be relatively soft. Sales of cars and light trucks were the slowest for any month this year. However, it was not because of the government shutdown. Instead, federal electric-vehicle tax credits worth up to $7,500 expired at the end of September, which pulled many purchases into the third quarter. We will be focusing on retail sales excluding volatile autos, in particular sales at restaurants and bars, which is the only part of the report that covers the service sector.

On Thursday the Labor Department will release the Consumer Price Index report for November and might include some key data for October, as well. In addition to the headline figures, we will be looking at details that hint at new trends. In particular, is housing rent inflation continuing to slow.

Primary rents for actual tenants rose 4.8% in the twelve months ending in September 2024 but a slower 3.4% in the twelve months ending in September 2025. Given slower money growth in the past three years, this deceleration should continue. We see no threat of outright deflation, but the Federal Reserve will pay close attention to rents when deciding how much room it might have to cut rates in 2026.

At last week’s meeting, the median prediction from Fed officials was that short-term rates would only drop one more quarter point next year. Meanwhile, the futures market is pricing in two cuts of that size. We think two cuts are more likely than one and there is even the possibility of three cuts. A new Fed Chair won’t have carte blanche, but if the economy and inflation both slow the case for more than one cut will be compelling.

As our readers know we believe the path of M2 is more important than the actual level of interest rates, and last week the Fed restarted quantitative easing, which should boost M2 in the months ahead.

In terms of President Trump’s pick for Fed Chair, what we would like to know is what the contenders think about reversing the regime of “abundant reserves” and the Fed paying banks interest on reserves. These policies were unnecessary for the Fed for nearly its first one hundred years, but its current leaders are adamant about keeping them after they were implemented in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-09, a crisis these new policies did nothing to stop or fix. Restarting QE seems like a shot across the bow to anyone who wants to alter course and return to a scarce reserve system.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential unified commercial platform and strategic integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, said, ""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential environmental-attribute monetization and digital infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream, said, ""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential multi-pathway SAF collaboration and offtake framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, CEO of Southern, added, ""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added, ""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential unified commercial platform and strategic integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, said, ""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential environmental-attribute monetization and digital infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream, said, ""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential multi-pathway SAF collaboration and offtake framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, CEO of Southern, added, ""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added, ""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals.

Special support for small cars is a positive element for EV adoption Addressing the need to sell more small cars is a positive step.
Member states are responsible for targets on corporate fleets, which also comes with uncertainty as the difference in adoption grows.
And member states will have to do their job when it comes to corporate fleets, too.
The proposed package requires approval of the European Parliament and member states.","1. What has been proposed and why?

The 100% ban on internal combustion engine cars (ICE) by 2035 will be lifted, while a 90% CO2-reduction from electrification remains. The last 10% needs to be achieved by using green steel or sustainable, renewable fuels.

The intermediate target of 2030 will be extended to 2032 by using credits averaging the target (banking & borrowing). Similarly, the EU previously decided to extend the 2025 target to 2027.

Sales of small electric cars, made in the EU, will be incentivised via so-called ‘super-credits’.

Member states will have to introduce binding targets for decarbonising corporate fleets by 2030 at the latest.

Lagging private demand, difficult market conditions and dependence on China are reasons for adjustment

European carmakers struggle to deal with the CO2-reduction targets in the current market, risking large fines and forcing them to push electric vehicle (EV) sales. The proposed adjustment to the CO2 regulation is an early review of the industry framework. Car manufacturers point to lagging demand for EVs; at the same time, the industry is being pressured in multiple ways as export and market stakes in the US and China are threatened, car sales at home are persistently low, and margins are subject to erosion due to less profitable electric cars and competition with Chinese brands.

Sourcing risks have added to that this year, with curbed exports of rare earth minerals and chips from China. The European automotive supply chain isn’t yet up to speed enough to reduce dependence and to deliver on the ambitions to source more from Europe.

2. What is the anticipated impact, and what does it mean for electrification?

The auto package will imply a further softening of the CO2 trajectory, although 90% by 2035 is still ambitious, particularly for lagging carmakers. It provides more flexibility for optimising the car sales mix along the way and opens up an opportunity to prioritise more profitable hybrids for longer.

Lowering ambition is a future risk

Softening the intermediate milestone for 2030 risks a slowdown of electrification, which is currently seeing decent momentum. Current policy requires a further drop from 90 gr/km in 2025-2027 to 49.5 gr/km in 2030 and 0% in 2035, which demands a rapid acceleration of around 17% in 2025 to 60% in 2030. This is now likely to end up lower.

Flattening the further uptake could also delay electrification of the fleet and CO2 emissions reduction from the car fleet, which takes us far beyond 2035.

Keeping other technologies alive and introducing new credits comes with complexity

From an industry perspective, the risk is that the package will slow down investments in EV technology as well as the general makeover of product portfolios, while keeping other technologies on the shelves (as well as associated investments). It may also reduce the urgency for lagging European member states to catch up in EV sales (and infrastructure).

For high-end and specialised cars, the new rules provide an escape route for the combustion engine, as they can pool their CO2 reduction efforts. To compensate for the final 10% of CO2 reduction from cars by 2035, carmakers could use credits for using green steel and renewable fuels. However, this creates complexity and will likely lead to extra discussions going forward.

Special support for small cars is a positive element for EV adoption

Addressing the need to sell more small cars is a positive step. Smaller electric models are less profitable and prioritised. The range of models needs to be expanded quickly to meet the needs of middle-class drivers and compete with Chinese brands. Counting small cars for 1.3 for the CO2 targets may slow progress elsewhere, but offering affordable new EVs alongside used cars will be a crucial part of the transition.

3. What’s the conclusion, and what’s next?

The auto package provides flexibility for the automotive industry in difficult times, but it also introduces uncertainty, risks reducing the push for EVs and delaying the scaling up of what is inevitably the future technology. Instead, other technologies – conventional cars, hybrids and plug-in hybrids – will be kept alive for longer while EVs eventually grow cheaper. The direction of travel won’t change, nor will the urgency to compete with Chinese competitors.

The plan introduces ‘pragmatism’, but complexity too, particularly in the final stages. Member states are responsible for targets on corporate fleets, which also comes with uncertainty as the difference in adoption grows.

Generally, an adjustment of the regulation just three years after the milestone adoption risks the impression that further adjustments may be possible. Auto industry body ACEA refers to a ‘first step’, and suppliers' body CLEPA still points to unresolved issues.

All in all, this signals the discussion isn’t over. And member states will have to do their job when it comes to corporate fleets, too. The proposed package requires approval of the European Parliament and member states.

What is an extended-range electric vehicle?
An Extended-Range Electric Vehicle, or EREV is a vehicle that uses an electric motor and large battery pack to move its wheels.
Electric vehicle adoption has stagnated, especially for large battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
The future of Ford appears to be more of a hybrid mix of gasoline engines, electric motors and batteries than fully-electric vehicles.","Electric vehicles haven't been a huge victory for Ford despite solid sales numbers.

Between production costs and stagnant demand, it's time for a change in game plan.

Ford announced a major shift in its brand strategy on Dec. 15. Despite success in sales, the Blue Oval will be adjusting its business strategy to focus on a range of hybrid and gasoline powertrains instead of solely fully-electric models like the Mach-E SUV and F-150 Lightning electric truck.

The shift in strategy will cost the Big Three automaker $19.5 billion. Ford expects half of its global sales to be hybrids, extended-range EVs and electric vehicles. This would mean a 33% increase in hybrid, EREV (Extended-Range Electric Vehicle) and electric vehicle sales in the next half-decade.

What is an extended-range electric vehicle?

An Extended-Range Electric Vehicle, or EREV is a vehicle that uses an electric motor and large battery pack to move its wheels. The electric motor is supported by a gas engine that works as a generator to produce electricity once the battery runs low.

Gas engines extend the range of these vehicles by generating electricity so drivers don't have to rely on the battery life of their cars in the same way that EV drivers do. Unlike a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), EREVs only use gasoline engines to generate more power instead of relying on the engines as a main power source.

Ultimately, EREVs are electric vehicles that get enough help from gas engines to relieve range anxiety and eliminate the issue of getting stranded without an EV charger. They're the best of both worlds like PHEVs, but they lean more heavily on the electrical components of their powertrains than plug-in hybrids do.

Why is Ford adjusting its brand strategy?

Ford's adjustment echoes a broader industry shift and aligns with the strategies of companies like Toyota. The Japanese automaker has taken a cautious approach to mass electrification in America, lagging behind Ford, Tesla and Hyundai in the production on new EV nameplates and sales. Electric vehicle adoption has stagnated, especially for large battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

The Blue Oval's shift in strategy is a move to meet real market demand versus just responding to market enthusiasm. A new focus on EREVs and hybrids could make the brand's portfolio more appealing to consumers, as opposed to expensive large BEVs that can no longer benefit from federal electric vehicle tax credits.

What's happening to the Ford F-150 Lightning?

The Ford F-150 Lightning isn't getting the axe and will survive the strategic shift. However, it'll undergo heart surgery to align with Ford's new goals. The Lightning drivers know (and may love) is no longer in production, but it will return as a next-generation EREV.

This can be great news for drivers if Ford is able to reduce the Lightning's starting price by using extended-range tech. If the new Lightning is even pricier than its BEV predecessor, it may not be worth the money. USA TODAY Cars tested the 2025 F-150 Lightning battery-electric full-size pickup truck and found few weaknesses aside from a slightly bloated starting price.

The future of Ford appears to be more of a hybrid mix of gasoline engines, electric motors and batteries than fully-electric vehicles.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/USNK/87148343007-20210520-t-022938-z-1049786805-rc-2-ejn-9-dmd-6-w-rtrmadp-3-fordelectricf-150-1.JPG?crop=5499,3093,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-17 19:58:48.592362

Washington (December 17, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) today introduced the Lowering American Energy Costs Act. The bill directs the President to prohibit most U.S. exports of natural gas due to their contribution to rising household energy costs—a move that will protect consumers from utility price hikes and reduce greenhouse gases. This would not be the first time Congress has prohibited fossil fuel exports: in 1975, Congress passed a ban on crude oil and natural gas exports—a ban that was repealed in 2015.

The Lowering American Energy Costs Act is cosponsored by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Representatives Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.). Representative Clarke previously co-led the Lowering American Energy Costs Act with Representative Espaillat in the House.

“Fossil fuel billionaires aren’t just harming our health by polluting our air, land, and water—they're busting our budgets every month through massive exports of fossil fuels that drive higher prices on the international market and create sky-high prices for us at home,” said Senator Markey. “The Lowering American Energy Costs Act would put a stop to natural gas exports that are draining Americans’ pockets, polluting our planet, and destroying our chance at a livable future.”

“The Lowering American Energy Costs Act would have an immediate impact on Americans' energy bills, which have skyrocketed in the past year, with many households seeing double digit increases in the rates they pay,” said Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “While this cost explosion is unprecedented, the solutions are clear. We must ramp up renewable energy generation and ensure that American households are our primary and priority consumers, not AI companies or foreign purchasers. I am proud to join Senator Markey, Representative Clarke, and our colleagues to offer this legislation, which would reestablish the export ban on fossil fuels that was lifted in 2015 at the behest of billionaire oil barons, and lighten the cost burden that energy bills are having on Americans.”

“When each passing day of inaction increases the severity of the climate crisis and decreases our ability to fight back against it, solutions like the Lowering American Energy Costs Act grow all the more critical. Banning the export of our energy resources is a necessary step towards, at long last, putting American families, futures, and communities first, and I am proud to co-lead this legislative answer to an already existential problem. It's past time we prioritize the American people over someone else's profits,” said Representative Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09).

Several stakeholders joined the lawmakers in endorsing the Lowering American Energy Costs Act.

“This bill is exactly what American families need to help stop soaring energy bills, driven by unchecked LNG exports. By leading this important legislation, Senator Markey and Representative Espaillat are standing up for consumers who are being exploited by profiteering LNG exporters, while also protecting communities from dangerous and unnecessary fossil fuel infrastructure,” said Jim Walsh, Policy Director of Food & Water Watch.

“At a time when household energy costs are skyrocketing for millions of Americans, stopping the expansion of costly, polluting gas export infrastructure is paramount. We are grateful that Senator Markey’s Lowering American Energy Costs Act prohibits the export of U.S. methane gas in order to lower costs and prevent already overburdened communities from more pollution and harm caused by the unnecessary fossil fuel buildout,” said Claire Dorner, Associate Director, Legislative and Administrative Advocacy, Beyond Dirty Fuels.

“This bold, commonsense bill will help protect the health and pocketbooks of American families, who’re being ravaged by filthy fossil fuels,” said Camden Weber, climate and energy policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “By banning U.S. methane gas exports, this bill prioritizes public health, tackles the emissions driving the climate crisis, and shields Americans from soaring energy costs. Sen. Markey is showing true leadership by putting the American people above corporate profits while the Trump administration and complicit Republicans side with fossil fuel interests.”

The United States is the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world—the country’s eight operating LNG export terminals consume more natural gas than 73 million American households combined. Unconstrained exports of natural gas have a direct impact on utility bills for American households, as confirmed repeatedly by Department of Energy studies conducted in 2012, 2018, and 2024 and by Energy Information Administration analysis released last month from the Energy Information Administration. Since Trump took office, United States households paid $12 billion more for natural gas than they did last year, largely because of the continuing rise in LNG exports—an average of about $124 more per household.

Senator Markey has long been outspoken about rising energy costs for American households, as well as the harmful economic and environmental impacts of unconstrained natural gas exports.

In November, Senator Markey introduced the Stop Shut-Offs During Shutdowns Act, legislation that calls on electric and gas utilities across the country to immediately suspend shut-offs of service for nonpayment during federal government shutdowns.

In March, Senator Markey reintroduced the Heating and Cooling Relief Act, legislation to significantly expand and modernize the severely underfunded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

During COP29 in November, Senator Markey partnered with Representative Lisa Badum of Germany and Senator Rosa Galvez of Canada to lead more than 130 leaders from around the world in sending an open letter urging world leaders and UN-level negotiators to support an immediate moratorium on the expansion of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure worldwide.

In September 2024, Senator Markey held a bicameral meeting between the Senate Climate Change Task Force and the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) titled “Liquefied Fossil Gas (LNG): International and Domestic Impacts of the Rapid Rise in U.S. Exports.”

In September 2024, Senator Markey led a letter with over 130 global legislators calling on Biden to fully halt LNG exports.

In July 2024, Senator Markey sent a letter with several New England Senators to the Department of Energy urging it to consider the disproportionate negative impacts of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on New England as the department considers updates to its underlying environmental and economic analyses to improve export authorization decisions for LNG.

In May 2024, Senator Markey sent a letter with Senators Merkley and Reed to thank the Biden administration for its January 2024 pause on LNG export approvals to countries without a free trade agreement on hold until evidence is reviewed and public input is taken into consideration.

In December 2023, Senator Markey led an open letter alongside German Member of Parliament (MP) Lisa Badum and Canadian Senator Rosa Galvez criticizing the global proliferation of LNG infrastructure.

In May 2023, Senator Markey reintroduced the Block All New (BAN) Fossil Fuel Exports Act. This bill would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act by directing the President to impose a rule banning the export of U.S. crude oil and natural gas abroad—reinstating the export ban lifted in 2015.

Why it matters:

Many homes across the Palmetto State are unable to benefit from weatherization programs because of pre-existing issues, such as roof leaks, electrical hazards, mold, pest infestations or structural deficiencies that must be addressed before energy efficiency upgrades can occur.

Where the money goes:

Qualified nonprofit organizations that prepare income challenged households for participation in energy efficiency and weatherization initiatives applied for grants up to $20,000 through a request for proposals process launched in September.

City of Florence ($10,000)

Helping Florence Flourish ($10,000)

United Way of Hartsville ($20,000)

Sumter United Ministries ($20,000)

Citizens United for Redevelopment and Economic Stability for Chester ($10,000)

Rebuild Upstate ($5,000)

“The Duke Energy Foundation grant will enhance the city’s Weatherization and Rehabilitation Program by funding critical home repairs for income-challenged households,"" said Jerry Dudley, planning director, City of Florence. ""Several homeowners are in urgent need of roof repairs. These grant dollars will help extend the reach of the city’s program, allowing us to serve more families and address essential housing needs.”

“Many homes in our state have underlying safety issues that prevent homeowners from participating in energy efficiency and weatherization programs that can significantly moderate energy bills and decrease the growing demand on the energy grid,"" said Tim Pearson, president, Duke Energy’s South Carolina. ""Recent legislative efforts have made it clear energy efficiency is critical to our long-term efforts to respond to growth in our state, and Duke Energy continues to look at new ways of expanding energy saving opportunities for our customers.”

Saving energy and money:

In addition to these grants, Duke Energy Progress launched a pilot program in South Carolina in 2024 offering free energy improvements to qualifying households based on income and energy use. And in 2025, Duke Energy increased incentives and eligibility for many of its energy efficiency and demand response programs in South Carolina, expanding ways customers can save money and energy.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs—much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.
In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city.
The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago—and everyday customers are eating those costs.
And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.","Bill Gates recently made headlines by suggesting that climate change is no longer a priority, but the American public begs to differ.

In this last election, climate change was a defining issue in states like Virginia and Georgia, where voters grappled with rising energy costs. And no matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs—much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago—and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74% between 2008 and 2024—and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40% in the past two decades—meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes, and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island—site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history—to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution, and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources, and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills, and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100% renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access, and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

Bolt is a data and energy infrastructure company co-founded by Eric Schmidt, former CEO and chairman of Google, who also serves as Bolt’s chairman.
“Bolt represents a significant step forward in bringing world-class technology infrastructure to West Texas,” TPL CEO Ty Glover said.
“With unmatched supply of both conventional fuel and renewable power, West Texas is a global leader for energy production.

Bolt is a data and energy infrastructure company co-founded by Eric Schmidt, former CEO and chairman of Google, who also serves as Bolt’s chairman.

“Our goal is to create the largest and most efficient data center company in the world by combining abundant energy production, efficient and scalable data infrastructure, and the largest land expansion runway in North America,” Schmidt said in a statement. “By partnering with TPL, Bolt will fuel the Fourth Industrial Revolution and protect and augment American leadership in artificial intelligence.”

‘West Texas is a global leader for energy production’

As part of the agreement, Bolt raised $150 million of capital and TPL invested $50 million. TPL will receive an equity interest, warrants, and a right of first refusal to supply water to Bolt-affiliated projects and related infrastructure. Bolt is seeking commercial partnerships and anchor customers to develop large-scale data centers on TPL land.

“Bolt represents a significant step forward in bringing world-class technology infrastructure to West Texas,” TPL CEO Ty Glover said. “With unmatched supply of both conventional fuel and renewable power, West Texas is a global leader for energy production. The region also benefits from a skilled workforce, a supportive regulatory environment, available water resources, and a strong entrepreneurial culture.”

Glover added, “We believe West Texas has the attributes necessary to become one of the largest concentrations of AI compute infrastructure globally, and combined with TPL’s ownership of nearly one million acres, our collaboration with Bolt is designed to help realize that opportunity. Bolt’s leadership, relationships, and proven experience in building transformative technology platforms make them an ideal partner for TPL.”

Schmidt outlined Bolt’s strategy and noted the advantages of West Texas and the TPL partnership.

“Bolt is focused on shortening the time between demand and delivery of compute at scale,” he said. “To be a reliable provider, Bolt will also focus on power production: natural gas-fueled, renewable, and ultimately, nuclear. TPL’s vast West Texas holdings and their expertise in land, energy, water, and regulatory execution makes them a uniquely capable partner.”

Land plus energy equals data centers

Texas Pacific Land Corporation is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with around 882,000 acres of land, the majority of which is concentrated in the Permian Basin. TPL isn’t an oil and gas producer, but its surface and royalty ownership provides revenue opportunities throughout the life cycle of a well. The company said it also generates revenue from pipeline, power line, and utility easements, commercial leases, and temporary permits related to a variety of land uses including, but not limited to, midstream infrastructure projects and hydrocarbon processing facilities.

Bolt Data & Energy is building an integrated AI infrastructure platform that combines abundant energy production, large-scale GPU computing, and scalable land expansion opportunities. The platform is designed to deliver reliable power, fast deployment, and consistent performance in the U.S.’s most advantaged energy regions. By linking energy ownership with advanced data infrastructure, Bolt said it is creating a pathway to the world’s largest and most efficient data center network to support the next wave of technological innovation and strengthen American leadership in artificial intelligence.

The palliative comes with an oft-repeated punch line—“Texas isn’t a red state, but a nonvoting one”—that even O’Rourke has voiced.
Those who are eligible to vote but abstain have outnumbered those who turned out for the highest vote getter in every Texas election this century.
But Texas is a red state because those who don’t vote, or who don’t often vote, are not, as a bloc, Democrats-to-be.
The Texas Democratic Party’s model estimated about 56 percent of 2018 nonvoters were Democratic leaning.","Here’s a story about politics that might challenge your assumptions. It’s about the race for the U.S. Senate in Texas in 2018, the last blue wave, when a large chunk of the electorate was angry enough at Donald Trump to show up at the polls in numbers not seen in a midterm in the modern era. By the time voting locations closed at 7 p.m. in El Paso on November 6, the campaign staff of both Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke had reason to be anxious: O’Rourke because no Democrat had won a statewide seat in Texas since 1994, and Cruz because his opponent had conducted a ferocious tour of the state and raised more than twice as much money, amassing a war chest that might have made Genghis Khan jealous. Then, before ballots were tabulated, the total vote count of 8.3 million was recorded—a turnout of 53 percent that shattered the percentage in all midterms in the state since 1970. As a person familiar with one of the campaigns relayed to me years ago, one candidate began to celebrate.

If you’ve followed Democratic politics this century, you might expect that the ebullient candidate was O’Rourke. The Texas Democratic Party’s conventional wisdom for decades has been that nonvoters tend to lean toward it, and that a campaign that could convince enough unconscientious objectors to exercise their rights could win. The palliative comes with an oft-repeated punch line—“Texas isn’t a red state, but a nonvoting one”—that even O’Rourke has voiced.

But the candidate who cheered high turnout on election night in 2018 was not, in fact, Beto. The Cruz campaign knew that there weren’t 8.3-million-divided-by-two-plus-one Democratic voters in the state, so if turnout was that high, there was no way he could lose. (A spokesperson for Cruz declined to comment on the anecdote.) And of course, Cruz was right. He did win. It was the closest statewide election since the nineties, but this was not, as Democrats often argue, because O’Rourke activated masses of onetime nonvoters. The real magic trick of his campaign was convincing hundreds of thousands of Texans who also voted for Republican Governor Greg Abbott to support him simultaneously—not enough, but no small measure.

Old canards, however, die hard. As we approach another midterm election during a Trump presidency, another Democratic Senate hopeful is preaching the message that Texas is a secretly blue state. Announcing her bid for the Democratic nomination to run for Senator John Cornyn’s seat last week, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett addressed “the haters in the back” of the South Dallas venue and explained how she could win a statewide seat though no Democrat had in three decades. “So they tell us that Texas is red,” she said, pausing, first as laughter erupted, and then to snicker herself. “They are lying,” she said, “We’re not. The reality is that most Texans don’t get out to vote.”

I was not there, but allow me, for a moment, to assume the role of Hater in the Back. Crockett’s claim is, bluntly, wrong. Texas is indeed a nonvoting state. Those who are eligible to vote but abstain have outnumbered those who turned out for the highest vote getter in every Texas election this century. The specific electorate changes every cycle, but as a group, the nonvoters are disproportionately young, poor, and Hispanic—three demographic segments Democrats have long assumed are likely supporters. Part of the reason some Texans don’t vote are voter suppression laws that make the state one of the toughest to cast a ballot in. But Texas is a red state because those who don’t vote, or who don’t often vote, are not, as a bloc, Democrats-to-be.

In 2022, when I asked dozens of local election officials, pollsters, political scientists, and political operatives for their estimates of the nonvoting population’s partisan allegiance, there was bipartisan consensus on the skew. The Texas Democratic Party’s model estimated about 56 percent of 2018 nonvoters were Democratic leaning. A GOP operative told me that lined up pretty well with his party’s estimate given its voter file, which modeled nonvoters by their consumer habits. (Do they shop at Cabela’s or Whole Foods?

To make up the large advantage Republicans have among existing voters, Democrats need to either drive huge numbers of those nonvoters to the polls while Republicans don’t or convince GOP-leaning voters to support them. Many campaigns try to do both, including that of Crockett’s primary opponent, state Representative James Talarico. JT Ennis, a spokesperson for the campaign, told me, “Ending thirty years of one-party rule in Texas requires a campaign that energizes the Democratic base, turns out new voters, and welcomes Trump voters who are now feeling conned.”

I asked Crockett about the balance of her strategy. “Nearly half of Texans don’t cast a ballot. Many feel that nothing ever changes or that their vote doesn’t matter. Frankly, too many politicians have relied on the same tired playbook of politics as usual,” she wrote. “By speaking directly to our shared realities, being unafraid in my advocacy, and unapologetic in my service, I’m earning the trust of a broad cross-section of Texans.”

When it comes to the turnout approach, there is no recent evidence, despite high-profile and expensive efforts to do so, that the Democratic party can outperform the GOP in getting nonvoters to the polls. Take the 2020 election, for example, the best turnout operation Democrats have ever run. That year, when there was a presidential race between Trump and Joe Biden, and Cornyn was last up for reelection, the party went all in on a strategy to activate low-propensity voters, those who are eligible to cast ballots but rarely do so. The state party invested a large chunk of its $25 million coffers into a voter model, which assigned each Texan a partisanship rating and a likelihood-to-vote score, based on prior electoral history. For those who were eligible to vote but had not registered—a number leaders said totaled 5 million (likely a twofold overestimate, which you can read more about here, and one Democrats have subsequently lowered)—the party estimated as much as 75 percent leaned Democratic. And then the party contacted all it deemed future Democrats.

Meanwhile, Republicans also saw fertile ground among the nonvoters. Steve Munisteri, the former party chair who had left Texas in 2015 to work for Senator Rand Paul and then for the Trump White House, returned to the state to assist with Cornyn’s reelection campaign and to help lead a turnout operation with Karl Rove, the electioneer who turned Texas red in the nineties. They focused some on the unregistered but eligible, setting up registration efforts outside places where Republicans gather, including Trump rallies and gun shows, and getting more than 200,000 Texans added to the voter rolls. (In Texas, voters don’t register by party, so the partisan allegiances of those they registered are unknown, but given where they were registered you can get a pretty clear idea.) They focused more heavily, however, on the 7.4 million Texans who were registered but hadn’t voted in 2018, targeting the 3 million the GOP’s voter model had flagged as likely Republican.

Unprecedented numbers of low-propensity voters went to the polls that year: The election in November was the highest turnout election by percentage since 1992, with 11.3 million of the state’s 17 million registered voters casting ballots. And Republicans swept every race—because infrequent voters in the state aren’t de facto Democratic ones.

In a postmortem report, the Democratic party noted that, according to its model of voter likelihood, Republicans were more successful at getting low-propensity voters to the polls. They were also better at getting new registrants to show up: While Democrats registered 150,000 more Texans than Republicans did, the GOP got 26,000 more people who were freshly eligible to vote to actually vote.

Why might that be? In 2022, I drove 1,454 miles, crisscrossing the lowest turnout counties in Texas, one of the lowest turnout states in the country, looking for nonvoters who could help provide an answer. I ignored the old wisdom to avoid discussing politics with strangers and spent days outside convenience stores, grocery emporiums, and dive bars asking whether folks planned to vote or not. The majority response was not yes or no. It was “What election is there?”

Many I met were lapsed but devout Republicans, voters who cared deeply about the oil and gas industry and gun rights but didn’t feel either were at risk and thus didn’t need to defend them. But I also met dozens of one-time Democrats who had suffered crises of faith and believed their votes didn’t matter enough to bother casting. Locally, these nonvoters told me, Democratic politicians who won accomplished nothing–streets remain unpaved, flood zones unprotected. Statewide and federally, some said, their votes didn’t count—Texas always went red anyway.

I met less cynical likely Democrats who told me they weren’t voting because no candidate had sought their vote, despite O’Rourke focusing heavily on turnout during his bid that year for governor. At the Reeves County Library in Pecos, I chatted with the receptionist, Mariana, beside a credenza where stacks of primary-election voter guides remained untouched, months after that election. Mariana was a college student who told me that her biggest concerns were the environment and gun control, and that she was on the “Democratic side of things.” But, even as O’Rourke, who famously vowed to seize citizens’ assault weapons, campaigned for governor, she insisted she wouldn’t vote for him. She explained she didn’t “know enough about the candidates” since “no one had reached out.” It’s unlikely any Democratic campaign would: Activating reticent voters is costly, and the party focuses most of its spending in large cities, where money goes further.

Democrats might see opportunity in Mariana’s story. Might Crockett, if she wins the party’s nomination, do a better job reaching out to those just waiting on a Democrat to care about them? Can she spend on those efforts better than Beto did with his massive campaign coffers?",https://img.texasmonthly.com/2025/12/democrat-turnout-strategy.jpg?auto=compress&crop=faces&fit=fit&fm=pjpg&ixlib=php-3.3.1&q=45,N,,2025-12-17 19:03:48.410117

NCAR, founded in 1960, developed some of the world’s first weather and climate prediction models at its iconic Mesa Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado.
Today, its 830 employees work on programs ranging from storm prediction to air pollution, in addition to operating advanced climate models.
Although NCAR and UCAR laid off nearly 30 people in September, the center had largely avoided major cuts, Busalacchi says.
“Honestly, the majority of work at NCAR is not climate change related,” Pielke says.","NEW ORLEANS—Alarm spread fast today among climate scientists here at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU): President Donald Trump’s administration, they learned, was going to try to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), one of the world’s premier climate and weather research centers. The news, delivered last night via a post on X from Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, had come with no prior warning from the White House or from NCAR’s funder, the National Science Foundation (NSF), says Antonio Busalacchi, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a consortium that manages NCAR.

Vought’s post asserted that NCAR is “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism,” and said the center’s “vital activities,” such as weather research, would be moved to another entity or location.

Today, NSF issued a statement saying it would begin “rescoping” NCAR’s work to focus on seasonal weather prediction, severe storms, and space weather, while it would explore options to transfer operations of its supercomputer and two aircraft to other managers.

Busalacchi says the attack on NCAR is yet another sign of the administration’s “attempts to cancel the freedom of scientific thought. … That should provide a shiver down the spine of every U.S. citizen.”

Shuttering the center would be “an abdication of U.S. leadership” says Roger Pielke Jr., a longtime critic of climate activism who spent much of his career at NCAR. “There are fair criticisms to make about institutions of climate science but destroying them is throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” says Pielke, now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

NCAR, founded in 1960, developed some of the world’s first weather and climate prediction models at its iconic Mesa Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. Today, its 830 employees work on programs ranging from storm prediction to air pollution, in addition to operating advanced climate models. Although NCAR and UCAR laid off nearly 30 people in September, the center had largely avoided major cuts, Busalacchi says. He says NCAR quickly complied with White House directives on diversity, equity, and inclusion earlier this year by halting its Rising Voices Center for Indigenous and Earth Sciences, one of the programs singled out by the White House, according to reporting by USA Today.

“Honestly, the majority of work at NCAR is not climate change related,” Pielke says. He thinks the attack may simply be projection—that “the administration doesn’t like the idea of climate change, and therefore anything related to climate must be bad.”

This week, the administration also canceled $109 million in green transportation grants to Colorado, including money to improve electric vehicle charging infrastructure and study alternative fuels for trains. Some believe the sudden attention on Colorado is because of Trump’s desire to free former County Clerk Tina Peters, who was sentenced in a state court to 9 years in prison for tampering with voting machines during the 2020 election.

In a joint statement, three Colorado Democrats in Congress—Senator Michael Bennet, Senator John Hickenlooper, and Representative Joe Neguse—said the threat to NCAR was “deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory,” and that they “intend to fight back against attempts to gut this cutting-edge research institution with every tool we have.”

NCAR’s course of action remains unclear. Busalacchi says he is willing to speak to the White House, whereas Pielke says appealing to Congress, which has historically provided strong bipartisan support for NCAR, might be a more promising avenue. Pielke also envisions a scenario in which NSF, which funds NCAR on 5-year grants, continues to support NCAR while “micromanaging” its priorities.

Without NCAR’s strong presence, state agencies that did not previously specialize in weather and climate prediction may need to step up, says Abre’ Conner, director of the Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at NAACP, a civil rights organization. NCAR was “one of the last standing places … that would allow for our communities to get answers” about weather and climate-related disasters, she says.

The news moved at least one scientist at AGU into action. Travis O’Brien, an atmospheric scientist at Indiana University Bloomington, stood on the sidewalk outside New Orleans’s convention center with a hastily constructed sign, which he says he made to inspire NCAR scientists to push back against the White House threats. (He notes that his comments are his own and do not represent his university.)

“Closing NCAR will harm the American public,” the sign read.",https://www.science.org/cms/asset/c0a5c0f1-7680-4e43-8b6e-3d1900d73e47/_20251217_on_ncar_closure.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 20:58:58.109034

Integrated quality control systems at the forefront Quality control is integrated with the control center of the production activities.
Increased production capacity for BYD battery manufacturing BYD possesses greater production capacity than most of its competitors.
BYD batteries’ global position and impact explained 20% of the batteries produced annually are sold by BYD to other companies and used in international energy projects.
Due to its scale and their ability to control the quality of products, BYD is positioning itself to be an industry competitive benchmark.","Although BYD is an industry leader in China, Americans view BYD as a relatively small player in the United States. However, unlike BYD’s competitors, BYD is not only trying to sell cars. Rather, BYD is attempting to control the battery OEM market as well. BYD aims to monopolize the battery supply chain and disrupt the market with the unprecedented scale of battery production.

BYD’s strategic focus on battery manufacturing

This is mainly the effect of BYD’s Zero Defects program. It is the company’s leading quality program aimed at the systematic elimination of all production errors. BYD is trying to reach a stage where an automobile can no longer be fabricated due to production errors, and at that stage, all other small vehicle producers will have to depend on this company’s economically dominant battery production.

Battery production at scale

In the first three quarters of the year 2025, BYD produced 113 GWh of batteries, which is enough to power hundreds of electric vehicles, large-scale energy storage systems, and other forms of large energy storage facilities. This volume is produced without compromising quality. BYD is achieving this through focusing on the production process, implementing systems to control quality, and finding defects quickly so that adjustments can be made before the situation worsens.

Volume and precision must be achieved together, and this is what the Zero Defects strategy is built on. Throughout the entire production process, the company ensures that there is efficiency, consistency, and safe control of the process and products.

Integrated quality control systems at the forefront

Quality control is integrated with the control center of the production activities. The assembly lines, testing, and logistics systems are designed to minimize quality variations of the systems and materials to be processed, and this improves quality traceability. BYD wants to make its reputation credible, and because of that, they are trying to achieve quality that not only meets the compliance requirements of the local market but also the requirements of international leading – and more importantly, energy – customers.

Increased production capacity for BYD battery manufacturing

BYD possesses greater production capacity than most of its competitors. High levels of automation enable BYD to produce more batteries more quickly than its competitors without compromising quality or precision. Testing each battery for quality and safety is the next step in the production process.

BYD meets the demands of customers in every country it operates in and is more adaptable in catering to the needs of customers in other countries. BYD is efficient in expanding its international presence.

BYD batteries’ global position and impact explained

20% of the batteries produced annually are sold by BYD to other companies and used in international energy projects. Although BYD has no presence in the US automobile market, it supports the widespread use of electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage.

To promote the widespread use of electric vehicles and the adoption of renewable energy, a reliable battery supply is essential. BYD’s supply of batteries in large and consistent volumes extends its influence beyond the country’s borders.

Quality improvement through defect elimination

In the spirit of the Zero Defects program, BYD anticipates the problems customers will experience with new products. BYD meets safety and quality standards through continuous auditing and inspection of processes.

Instead of end-of-line corrections, BYD focuses on prevention by integrating quality controls during production. Due to its scale and their ability to control the quality of products, BYD is positioning itself to be an industry competitive benchmark. This allows them to compete globally in all markets on electric vehicles and energy storage, even in geographic markets where BYD does not sell vehicles.

The project is a joint partnership between the university and the Saint John’s Abbey.
Once that happens, it will allow Saint John’s to generate nearly 35 percent of its electricity through the steam produced as a byproduct of heating and cooling.
Even during the hardest weather, the system continues to operate as designed, which means that when all components are functioning properly, we should not experience electrical outages.” The STG project also qualifies for the Investment Tax Credit.
It was then transported to Saint John’s where it was lowered to be rolled into place by a 350-ton crane.","The energy-making capacity at Saint John’s University is about to get a giant boost thanks to the new steam turbine generator (STG) that was installed inside the power house on campus Tuesday (Dec. 16).

The skid containing the STG – which weighed in at 37,500 pounds – was lowered by crane then wheeled into place in its new home atop a gigantic concrete slab, marking a huge milestone in a project that has been underway since the older (and much smaller) turbine was decommissioned four years ago.

The project is a joint partnership between the university and the Saint John’s Abbey. The STG being replaced dated back to the 1950s.

“It was at the end of life, so we decommissioned it in 2021,” CSB and SJU Chief Facilities and Resilience Officer Russ Klein said. “After a year of discernment, we determined that even after all these years, our approach still made sense. We moved into design in 2023 with the intent to preserve that foundation, but to add a contemporary twist and benefit from advances in technology.”

The new STG is expected to be operational in April. Once that happens, it will allow Saint John’s to generate nearly 35 percent of its electricity through the steam produced as a byproduct of heating and cooling.

“The benefit is that it allows us to reduce expense and it does so in a way that’s both sustainable and operationally efficient,” Klein said.

“Then there’s the part that people don’t see, which is the resiliency benefit. When we lose power from Xcel Energy, we not only have our diesel backups, but we have the STG that doesn’t shut off. We produce steam reliably in all conditions. Even during the hardest weather, the system continues to operate as designed, which means that when all components are functioning properly, we should not experience electrical outages.”

The STG project also qualifies for the Investment Tax Credit. This is part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allows nonprofits to rebate up to 30 percent of a project’s cost.

“Overall, we’re going to be reducing our expenses while improving our resiliency to factors mostly out of our control,” Klein said. “This project is an exemplar of financial and operational excellence.”

Just preparing for the STG’s arrival Tuesday was a six-month process. It was manufactured in India, then shipped first to Pennsylvania and on to Michigan for packaging. It was then transported to Saint John’s where it was lowered to be rolled into place by a 350-ton crane.

In addition to the turbine, a new 15,0000-pound transformer is being set in place as well.

“It took a lot of prep work to get us to this point,” Klein said. “We had to pour a massive concrete slab because this (STG) is so much heavier and we needed to spread its weight across a large area. The floor (inside the power house) was reinforced. But we also had to shore up the pathway we were rolling it over from underneath as well. Then there was a lot of prepping of the electrical switch gear.

“So this was a pretty big undertaking.”",https://www.csbsju.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Steam-turbine-in-place-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 18:01:05.976667

https://www.uschamber.com/major-initiative/essential-chemistry-for-america","Dear Chairs Guthrie and Palmer, and Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko:

Thank you for holding tomorrow’s hearing entitled “Examining the Impact of EPA’s CERCLA Designation for Two PFAS Chemistries and Potential Policy Responses to Superfund Liability Concerns” and for continuing your engagement on a very complex and challenging issue for communities and companies across the U.S. We support accelerating effective and appropriate cleanup of PFAS in the environment, based on the best science and risk management. We believe strongly, however, that applying the joint and several liability regime of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) to PFOA and PFOS, via EPA’s novel 2024 rule that listed PFOA and PFOS as CERCLA hazardous substances, would only delay those efforts.

We believe CERCLA is the wrong policy tool to address this issue:

· The EPA rule is unlawful for several reasons.[1]

[1] The Chamber and other trade groups are parties to litigation challenging the rule; our briefs and other materials can be found at https://www.uschamber.com/cases/energy-and-environment/cerclarule. See also. https://www.uschamber.com/regulations/coalition-comments-epas-proposed-rule-designation-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa-and

Among other things, EPA did not properly consider costs and consequences in deciding whether to utilize a never-before-used provision of CERCLA to designate the two substances as hazardous.

· The rule is not consistent with President Trump’s policy agenda for economic growth and prosperity, which includes rolling back excessively costly regulations, promoting U.S. manufacturing and national economic security, and unleashing America’s energy dominance.

· The rule triggers major costs and unintended consequences with far-reaching impacts for farmers, landowners, businesses, the U.S. economy, and our supply chains.[2]

,[3]

[3]New Chamber Report Highlights High Costs for Communities Associated with EPA's Approach to PFAS | U.S. Chamber of Commerce

These costs are associated with, among other things, conducting response activities, complex litigation and protracted cost allocation proceedings, delaying closure of sites or reopening existing sites that have PFOS or PFOA or adding additional sites to the National Priorities List, and the opportunity costs every individual, business, or property owner potentially affected by the rule may incur.

· The listing would affect every real estate transaction for properties where PFOA and PFOS are potentially present.

· Litigation, and cost recovery disputes and activities, do not equate to actual cleanup. CERCLA is a particularly ineffective tool for driving cleanup of substances that the Agency has concluded are widespread.

We urge the Committee to consider more workable solutions that:

· Utilize alternative authorities that are more targeted for real, timely cleanup and that better fit with policy goals of both the Administration and Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, including the key objective of helping communities affected by PFAS contamination.

· Streamline the cleanup process to ensure timely and predictable approaches, and appropriate protection from the consequences of the rule for all parties. We believe that replacing the rule with alternative, more targeted regulatory approaches to PFOA and PFOS would be fairer and more beneficial for the environment and the economy.

· Make clear that all relevant costs and consequences need to be considered.

Finally, not all PFAS are the same. Production and import of PFOA and PFOS have largely been phased out in the U.S. for more than a decade. By imposing CERCLA liabilities on properties that include PFOA and PFOS, the rule triggered concern that EPA would do so for other chemistries with far different profiles, thus creating a disincentive to use many safe and effective fluorochemistries in critical products from airplanes to cars, cellphones, medical devices, and emerging technologies that will drive American energy dominance. DoD, for example, recently released an updated report on critical uses of PFAS, highlighting the complexities, timeframes, and challenges of transitioning from various PFAS applications.[4]

The Chamber has developed research corroborating the importance of such essential chemistries to critical sectors across the economy.[5]

The Senate voted 23 to 13 just hours after the Senate Appropriations Committee heard from a variety of entities impacted by the cuts.

State Senator Sarah Anthony took to Facebook Tuesday night to make the announcement showing bipartisan support.

Among among the impacted entities, Wigs 4 Kids, which provides wigs for children with cancer.

""We feel caught in the middle and were blindsided by the decision to recapture funds,"" Wigs 4 Kids CEO and Founder Maggie Varney said.

The city of Hamtramck also lost out on funding for a new fire truck.

""We are on the hook for an over $900,000 piece of apparatus that frankly my controller and I are trying to figure out how we are going to pay for now,"" Fire Chief Matt Wyszczelski said.

The cuts have received condemnation from some lawmakers of both parties in the Senate.

Democrats say the process lacked transparency and note a number of corporate subsidies were left untouched.

They also questioned whether the state can be relied upon after the abrupt cuts using a rare mechanism.

""Local governments, hospitals, nonprofits, workforce partners made hiring decisions, signed contracts with the state based on the reasonable expectation that these funds would be there,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chair, Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), said.

Senate Republican Appropriations Vice Chair Jon Bumstead (R-North Muskegon) echoed that sentiment, saying the legislature should stick to the promises it made.

“To me, a person is only as good as their word, and we can't lose that, we can't lose the people's trust,"" Bumstead said.

Ahead of the Senate's vote, Republican House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) doubled down on the cuts, saying they prevented Democrats from using the projects to grow what's he's labeled ""slush funds.""

“We need to eliminate a lot of this pork spending, get it under control,” Hall said. ”We need to be spending money on really the core essential needs of state government.”

The senate's action, unlike the house's, still needs to be approved by the opposite chamber.

Attempts by House Democrats to get the measure to the floor for a vote failed Wednesday.

The outcome seemed likely as Hall reiterated his position in a statement Tuesday night.

“The Senate Democrats are so addicted to pork and their secret slush funds that they just voted to reinstate the waste, fraud, and abuse that House Republicans fought to eliminate,"" Hall said. ""Ultimate Lansing insiders like Sarah Anthony continue to do the bidding of lobbyists and the radical left special interests. Not the taxpayers. This isn’t surprising at all.”

House Democrats have proposed a bill to prevent the unilateral use of the appropriations mechanism again.

Senate Democrats also sent a letter to Attorney General Dana Nessel seeking guidance on whether the house's unilateral cuts were legal.

Her office confirmed it is reviewing the letter, but doesn't expect an opinion until after the holidays.",https://wwmt.com/resources/media2/16x9/4000/1320/0x375/90/75fe7f31-1181-4e3f-94e4-902a2d25ae1a-6021.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 20:58:05.281102

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.

The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect ... Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”

That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.

Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting ... intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

And individual cities and counties — not the state legislature — are in charge of setting local property tax rates.
Most North Carolina counties shrank in population between 2010 and 2020, even though the state’s population as a whole skyrocketed.
On Wednesday, Cervania told them to reconsider how they can square that stance with these other concerns over property taxes.","A bipartisan committee of North Carolina lawmakers met for the first time Wednesday to begin the process of examining state laws governing property taxes — part of an effort to deliver financial relief to homeowners without harming municipal services.

The House Select Committee on Property Tax Reduction and Reform was created last week and kicked off Wednesday with a presentation on what the state’s already doing with some targeted property tax relief programs — to the tune of more than $100 million a year, mostly spent on seniors and military veterans — as well as presentations on what other states are doing.

Concerns over senior citizens were a key focus of the meeting. Many older Americans no longer work and are living on a fixed income of Social Security payments in addition to any other pensions or investments they may have. Many have also lived in the same home for decades and in some cases no longer have mortgage payments. But rising property values have caused property taxes to rise as well, increasing their bills.

“We’ve got to shift, to make them be able to age in place,” Rep. Carla Cunningham, D-Mecklenburg, said. “I think that's what a lot of seniors are dealing with. They can't stay in their home because it's too expensive.”

Younger people, as well as those unable to afford a home, also received some attention at the meeting. Several lawmakers noted that one reason rents have risen in recent years is that landlords are passing off property tax hikes onto their renters — something that could apply to people renting homes and apartments, as well as to businesses renting space.

“It's affecting not only potential homeowners or current homeowners,” Rep. Erin Paré, R-Wake, said Wednesday. “It’s also impacting renters, and even small businesses who rent. That cost gets pushed off on them. So this is a big deal.”

In recent years, Republican state lawmakers have rewritten tax laws to reduce income taxes and expand the list of things people have to pay sales taxes on. But the state legislature has so far made few changes related to property taxes.

Housing affordability is a growing and bipartisan political issue, however, and the committee intends to show voters that the legislature is paying attention to the issue as the 2026 elections approach, when every state lawmaker will be up for reelection.

Unlike income tax and sales tax revenue, property tax revenue doesn’t go to the state. The money stays in the cities and counties that collect those taxes, helping fund local schools, parks, police, sheriffs and more. And individual cities and counties — not the state legislature — are in charge of setting local property tax rates.

A broad effort to lower property taxes could lead to budget cuts for schools and police. This new push is expected to be more targeted. State House Speaker Destin Hall said in a statement last week that the new committee would look into “practical ways to reduce the burden on homeowners without undermining local services.”

A group that lobbies on behalf of cities and counties, the North Carolina League of Municipalities, is wary of any proposals that might cut into their ability to collect taxes. Scott Mooneyham, a league spokesman, told reporters after Wednesday’s hearing that about half of all municipal spending goes to public safety — police departments, sheriff’s offices and fire departments.

“It is impossible to substantially alter property taxes in the state of North Carolina without defunding the police,” he said.

In some parts of the state — especially in more rural areas — a lack of new development or the loss of people and businesses have forced local leaders to raise rates on those who remain.

Most North Carolina counties shrank in population between 2010 and 2020, even though the state’s population as a whole skyrocketed. The fastest-growing parts of the state, meanwhile, have been able to keep property tax rates low as new development has broadened the base of what can be taxed.

But even in Wake County — which has among the lowest property tax rates in North Carolina, and whose residents are the wealthiest in the state — some lawmakers are still concerned with the impact of any potential rate hikes. That is, in part, because Wake County also has higher property values than most of the rest of the state.

Rep. Maria Cervania, D-Wake, is a former Wake County Commissioner. She noted that most of what any county in North Carolina pays for — schools and law enforcement make up the vast majority of county spending — are also supplemented by state and federal funds. But as Republicans have slashed taxes and spending at the state and federal levels, she said, that has forced cities and counties to step up and fill those gaps.

GOP leaders in the state legislature are currently debating whether to keep lowering income tax rates. On Wednesday, Cervania told them to reconsider how they can square that stance with these other concerns over property taxes.

“That is what, I believe, is a large part of the increases in our counties and municipalities, in terms of their tax rate,” she said. “So we need to look at ourselves, too, in this responsibility. I don't know what the answer is, but it's a balance.”",https://images.wral.com/asset/5oys/2025/11/17/22250701/Homeowner__Unsplash-DMID1-690yygzjf-4592x3448.jpg?w=1200&h=630&height=630,N,,2025-12-17 19:59:27.878057

What is Project Matador?

Project Matador, also known as the President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus is under construction about 12 miles northeast of Amarillo. As of the time this blog is released, if actually constructed, it would be the largest data center on earth, and it would be powered by the largest combination of gas, nuclear, solar and battery storage facilities ever built. The key word is “if.”

December 4 Community Meeting in Panhandle

On December 4, 2025, hundreds of local residents, along with some college students bused in by the company behind the project, gathered at a community center in the town of Panhandle, adjacent to the proposed 5,236-acre site. The meeting focused on one of the first required permits for the project: a series of air quality permits that would allow Fermi America to build and operate 93 gas-fired turbines around the perimeter of the AI data center. If actually constructed, the facility’s more than 5,100 MW of gas capacity would make it the largest gas plant in the United States.

While Lone Star Chapter staff members were unable to attend the meeting, we’ve been in discussions with community members who attended to express their concerns about the data center’s technology, the high number of proposed gas plants, and the looming threat of water loss due to the demand of the gas plants and data centers themselves. The project involves building power plants to attract the AI and data centers. Fermi itself does not propose to build the data centers.

Heading up the project, and playing the role of Head Cheerleader, is Rick Perry.

Neugebauer is also a top donor to politicians like Perry and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Rounding out the team is the community liaison, former Amarillo Mayor Trent Sisemore, who operates Fermi out of a humble office in Amarillo just above a local bank.

The office of Fermi America can be found on the third floor of this historic office building.

Concerns About Air Quality and Gas Turbines

Fermi’s requested permits are unusual in that the company is seeking one “PSD” permit to operate over 5100 MWs of gas, even though many of the turbines are separately operated as “six-on-one” units that collectively act like combined cycle power plants. (In addition, the company also has a separate permit to authorize global warming gas emissions).

Utility energy efficiency plans should be easier to read now.
As part of our filing, we turned in comments from more than 600 Texans calling for change and expansion of the energy efficiency programs.
Centerpoint Settlement Agreement At the PUCT The PUCT also adopted a settlement agreement between the Sierra Club, City of Houston, and Centerpoint Energy on Centerpoint’s 2026 energy efficiency programs.
Sierra Club reached a similar agreement with AEP Texas in their 2026 energy efficiency case, though we are waiting for the Commission to formally adopt the order.","On Friday, December 12, the Public Utility Commission of Texas finally kept a promise they had made back in 2021 - assess and make changes to the energy efficiency and “load management” programs that the state’s eight private transmission and distribution utilities are required to run under Texas law. These are the programs that many thousands of Texans use to weatherize their homes, reduce their electricity bills, and help the environment in the process by relying less on polluting power plants.

While the commission made it clear this was just the first step in the process, the new rules adopted under Project No. 57743, make five important changes:

More realistic savings estimates should mean more money goes to programs - not huge performance bonuses for big utilities. The most important change is ERCOT’s calculation of the avoided cost of energy is now based on seven years of data - not just two - and is calculated in April rather than in November, giving more time for utilities to actually plan their programs with cost data in hand. Because the avoided cost of energy drives the determination of whether programs are cost-effective, but also the “incentive” that utilities can earn by exceeding the modest goals set in statute, utilities were routinely earning “bonuses” that were eating up the budgets intended to help their customers save energy. In the most recent round of annual energy efficiency programs scheduled for 2026, about a third of the overall budgets were dedicated to these incentives, driven by the high cost of energy in recent years. Averaging the cost of energy over seven years provides a much better baseline.

More limits placed on what utilities can charge Texans to benefit themselves. The rules also limit the benefit or incentive utilities can earn to 5 percent of the net benefit of the program, reducing it from 10 percent. Because net benefit is based on the benefits to the utilities, staff proposed limiting those incentives to a more reasonable level. While it is too early to tell the effect, incentives that were routinely in the 30 to 40 percent level will likely be in a more reasonable 10 to 15 percent incentive with this change.

More Texans could qualify for special energy savings incentives. The amendments also clarify the distinction between targeted low-income programs and a program for hard-to-reach customers. Under the changes in definition, low-income customers who have historically been served by hard-to-reach programs should continue to be included as potential hard-to-reach customers, but the adopted rule also expands the proposed definition of ""hard-to-reach"" so that utilities can expand their programs beyond the traditionally served low-income customers to those that may not have been served historically, including rural landowners, and small businesses with a demand less than 50 KW.

More Texans could be eligible for free weatherization programs. The updated rule refines the definition of low-income customer to be based on a calculation of 80% of the area median income, or resides in a household in which at least one person receives economic assistance through a program listed in the Texas technical reference manual (TRM) for the applicable program year. Existing §25.5 also includes a definition for ""low-income customer"" that is based on whether the customer qualifies for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka, SNAP) or medical assistance from a state agency. In essence, with this change in definition, more Texans should have access to “free” weatherization programs in Texas.

Utility energy efficiency plans should be easier to read now. Finally, the updated rule creates a new template that utilities must use when they file their annual energy efficiency plan, making it easier for the public to understand what is being proposed by the utility for upcoming years.

While modest, the Sierra Club, the South Central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource, the Office of Public Utility Counsel, the City of Houston, the American Council on an Energy Efficient Economy, and others were largely supportive of the rule change, even as the utilities themselves disagreed with some of the changes related to the incentives. In adopting the rules, both Chairman Gleeson and Commissioner Kathleen Jackson praised staff - and stakeholders - for finally taking on the programs, which are another important tool to assure affordability and reliability.

The PUCT is not done, and in its reply to the Sierra Club comments, the Commission noted that many additional issues raised by the Sierra Club - including energy savings goals, cost caps, and the difference between ERCOT and non-ERCOT utilities - will be addressed in future rulemaking. As part of our filing, we turned in comments from more than 600 Texans calling for change and expansion of the energy efficiency programs. Thanks!

How Long Does Rulemaking Take?

It was back in December 2021 that the Commission adopted its blueprint for reliability reforms, which included a provision that it would make its “energy efficiency” programs more “efficient.” However, when the Commission took no action, the Sierra Club first initiated a petition for rulemaking in 2022, and then attempted to pass legislation in both 2023 and 2025 to reform and expand the energy efficiency programs. While the PUCT rejected the petition for rulemaking, and only the Senate advanced energy efficiency legislation, the action last week marked the first major change to the programs in more than 15 years. The Sierra Club is not giving up and will continue to press for further changes in 2026.

Centerpoint Settlement Agreement At the PUCT

The PUCT also adopted a settlement agreement between the Sierra Club, City of Houston, and Centerpoint Energy on Centerpoint’s 2026 energy efficiency programs. Under the agreement, Centerpoint Energy agrees to spend more than $50 million on energy efficiency programs in 2026, while keeping a healthy $40 million in incentives, allowed under the rules before they were just changed. We argued strenuously that Centerpoint should spend more on programs that help Texans and less on bonuses for themselves, but in the end the wealthy utility will take more than 40% of their energy efficiency budget as a bonus for the next year. However, Centerpoint Energy will continue to conduct a market potential study on energy efficiency in its service territory, meet with the Sierra Club to review its programs and consider improvements, provide information to customers about potential federal funding available through the State Energy Conservation Office, and hold a public meeting in the Houston area to help customers learn about how to access Centerpoint Energy programs. A copy of the settlement can be found here.

Sierra Club reached a similar agreement with AEP Texas in their 2026 energy efficiency case, though we are waiting for the Commission to formally adopt the order. In both cases, while we are unable to reduce the very large bonuses for the utilities in 2026, the changes in rules will prevent such large bonuses or incentives from occurring in the future!",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-12/logoseal_color-150-1.png.webp?itok=GyLfLKH-,N,,2025-12-17 19:04:16.502852

LISTEN: EL PASO MATTERS PODCAST","By Salvador López Córdova

Along the U.S.-Mexico border, communities like El Paso and Ciudad Juárez — much like other pairs of “sister cities” — are bound by deep historical, cultural and family ties, as well as a vibrant regional economy that supports tens of thousands of jobs and sustains a significant share of bilateral trade.

That economic engine continues to show remarkable strength. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, the state of Chihuahua exported more than $26 billion in goods — an increase of 43% compared with the same quarter of 2024, according to the latest data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography, or INEGI. These numbers reflect a robust industrial base fully integrated into North American supply chains.

Yet it is equally important to recognize that this dynamic economy places pressure on local infrastructure and the quality of life for border residents. The region’s interdependence, the inherently cross-border nature of its economic activity and the fact that both countries share natural resources and air basins, all underscore a shared responsibility to push for a more prosperous future, while also ensuring clean water, air and land for all.

At the North American Development Bank, or NADBank, we support infrastructure projects that deliver a triple benefit: strengthening economic competitiveness, improving quality of life and enhancing general well-being. To advance this mission, we provide financing, as well as technical assistance that helps border communities generate the data and expertise needed to pursue long-term solutions.

Such solutions require several key ingredients: vision, leadership and political will; interagency — and in many cases, international — coordination; and, critically, access to reliable data to support informed decision-making.

The Paso del Norte Joint Advisory Committee, or JAC, offers a clear example of what is possible when these elements come together. The JAC brings together all levels of government, academia and civil society across three states and two countries. It functions as a community-based body overseeing efforts to secure cleaner air for the entire Paso del Norte region.

NADBank has supported the JAC’s mission as a core partner in establishing the Air Quality Monitoring Fund — initially financed through contributions from NADBank and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The fund has enabled the expansion and ongoing operation of Juárez’s air-monitoring network: increasing the number of monitoring stations from four to five, ensuring continuous measurements and providing public reporting for three years. With this information, local authorities, experts and the public can assess risks in real time and plan appropriate actions.

We also provided technical assistance for the development of the Social and Environmental Indicators Dashboard for Ciudad Juárez, created by Rice University and Tecnológico de Monterrey. This tool makes it possible to analyze and visualize key information that reveals how economic, social and environmental factors interact within the city.

Similarly, NADBank supported a pilot study on zero- and low-emission trucks for the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo corridor, one of the most important international trade corridors between the two countries. Conducted by Texas A&M University and the Texas Transportation Institute, the study identifies financially viable opportunities for reducing emissions at border crossings through technological upgrades and logistical improvements.

The border economy is well-positioned to continue growing. Its strong industrial foundation, skilled workforce and strategic location give the region a unique advantage. Our role, as a development bank, is to support the knowledge and infrastructure that will allow this growth to flourish while ensuring that border residents can also thrive with clean, healthy air to breathe.

At NADBank, we understand that lasting progress begins at the local level. That is why we will continue to strengthen partnerships, support projects that bring technical clarity and offer financing solutions tailored to the needs of El Paso, Juárez and all border communities.

Salvador López Córdova is the chief environmental officer at NADBank.

And they worked. These policies have spurred more than $292 billion in private-sector clean energy investment across 49 states, with anticipated job creation of approximately 358,000 — progress now in jeopardy.

In 2025, the policy landscape changed. The Trump Administration has led the crusade to deliver a gut punch to the EV market and eviscerate the Biden-era policies, regulations, and incentives that have helped boost EV market momentum. The current administration has taken unprecedented steps to undermine the Clean Air Act, loosen federal fuel-efficiency standards, revoke states’ rights to set stricter tailpipe emissions standards, and eliminate incentives such as EV tax credits that have helped new- and used-car shoppers switch to EVs.

Make no mistake, the oil industry is driving the rollback of supportive EV policies and regulations. Oil companies are increasingly concerned as EVs displace the internal combustion engine, which is the oil industry’s largest customer. Their concern is warranted, given that more than one in four cars sold globally this year will be EVs. In America, where the oil industry has outsized political influence, it is leveraging that power to slow the transition to electric transportation and hinder the EV market’s expansion.

Hinder as they may, the oil industry and their paid-for politicians can’t halt the shift to EVs.

The ABCs of EVs

Despite the political whipsawing, the latest J.D. Power consumer interest survey shows that 24% of active shoppers say they are “very likely” to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months. Consumer interest remains strong because EVs have proven to be more affordable, better, and more convenient than the old technology:

Affordable—Driving an EV saves the average consumer $1,000 annually in avoided gasoline costs and hundreds of dollars more in avoided maintenance.

Better—EVs are technologically cutting-edge, high-performing, and fun to drive, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions upwards of 80% compared to gas cars.

Convenient—For most EV owners, 80% of EV charging occurs at home while they sleep; the average EV range has tripled over the past decade to approximately 300 miles; and public EV charging infrastructure has expanded to over 234,000 ports nationwide.

A is for Affordability, U is for Used

Affordability remains a priority for Americans, regardless of political ideology. In the recent November elections, voters ousted incumbents they blamed for rising bills and elected candidates they trusted to make life more affordable. With voters demanding that elected officials address affordability and consumer interest in EVs remaining unshakeable, the EV market has an ace up its sleeve: The best way for consumers to lower their energy and transportation costs is to ditch gas and switch to EVs, especially used ones.

Over the past three years, consumers have leased millions of new EVs. As these leases expire, most leased EVs will enter the used-car market, where two-thirds of consumers buy cars. Used EVs already compete with gas vehicles on price and outperform them on value, meaning many consumers priced out of the new-vehicle market now have access to more affordable EV ownership.

In 2025, 243,000 EV leases will end, more than 3 times the number that ended in 2024. In 2026 and beyond, the used EV market will continue to expand rapidly as the surge in new EV leases over the past five years drives growth in the used market. And because 92% of EV owners plan to buy another EV for their next car, the expanding used-EV market will significantly increase the total number of EVs on the road.

Spreading the Word

With EV owner satisfaction high, consumer interest holding, and the affordable used EV market growing, we can weather the current political anti-EV storm, provided we can overcome the consumer awareness barrier, cut through EV disinformation and hostile rhetoric, and communicate the ABCs of EVs widely. But it remains undeniable that we need reliable government support to build a robust domestic EV market that provides consumers with clean and affordable transportation options, keeps American auto and supply chain businesses competitive globally, secures domestic supply chains, and delivers good-paying jobs.

We need to meet consumers where they are, with compelling, persuasive stories about how the transition to EVs will make their transportation more affordable, better, and more convenient. The right stories about the ABCs of EVs, told in the right places by the right voices, can cut through the anti-EV noise and convince consumers that EVs are a critical part of the affordable future they want. EV communications work is underway at the national and regional levels. Examples of existing campaigns include Clean Energy Generation, Energy for All Y’all, Electric For All, and Electrify Your Ride. Each is doing a good job, in its own way, of meeting the moment. But we need much more: funding, collaboration, and scale to reach deep into mainstream America.

Another ace up the sleeve

Meanwhile, there is another ace up the EV market’s sleeve—the 92% of happy EV owners. If you are one of them, talk to your friends, family, and neighbors about your experience. Notwithstanding the need for effective professional communications campaigns, there is no better EV messenger than a satisfied EV driver talking to those they know.

So spread the word because it’s not just about people buying EVs: consumers are also voters. The more who understand the ABCs of EVs, the more likely they are to vote for candidates who support ditching unaffordable internal combustion engines and getting America back on the path to affordable electric transportation.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-17 17:03:11.934643

California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner.
The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.","SAN FRANCISCO(AP) — California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.

The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.

After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.

Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.

“Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,"" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

In a post on Musk's X service, Tesla brushed off the decision as regulatory overkill. “This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem. Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,” the company said.

The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world’s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.

Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, the fallout has continued to weigh on Tesla's auto sales, which had decreased by 9% from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.

Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration — a “somewhat successful” assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.

The performance of Tesla's stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk's efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the U.S.

Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.

California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.

Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/1e00faef-ab02-4675-ba5e-09ca248515a6/20251217T201013/1e00faef-ab02-4675-ba5e-09ca248515a6.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:05:08.782610

According to the American Action Forum (AAF), “the company indicated in its recent filings that it does not appear viable to fully retire fossil fuel generation to meet VCEA compliance by 2045—a conclusion supported by a separate study commissioned by the commonwealth.” AAF adds that “Dominion’s projected summer peak load [is expected to grow] by 70 percent between 2022–2045.”

The rapid growth of AI data center demand makes meeting carbon-free targets extremely difficult, if not impossible. Climate goals are achievable only if demand is stifled, which would result in industry going abroad, as Europe is experiencing, leaving China to win the AI race.

Texas is a Booming AI Data Center State

Texas, as a red state with cheap land, relatively inexpensive energy, and a business-friendly tax and regulatory environment, is also attracting data center developers to the state. The expected demand is so large that many believe it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, according to CNBC. More than 220 gigawatts have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and more than 70% of those projects are data centers. That demand is more than twice the state’s peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. CNBC reports that ERCOT worries that speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize. State legislation in 2023 requires projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts.

Via CNBC, requests from large projects for connections to Texas’s electric grid have nearly quadrupled this year, highlighting the gap between speculative demand and what is likely to materialize. More than half of the proposed capacity — about 128 gigawatts — has not yet submitted the required studies for review by ERCOT. Another roughly 90 gigawatts is either under review or has received planning-study approval. By contrast, only about 7.5 gigawatts of projects have actually connected to the grid or secured full approval from ERCOT, a level of demand the state can readily accommodate. Texas could realistically supply 20 to 30 gigawatts of data-center demand by 2030, grid planners say, but not the far larger volumes implied by the speculative interconnection requests now on file.

Furthermore, CNBC reports that Texas is trying to reduce speculative requests for connections through a law passed in May that requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project, show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease, and disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. Fortunately for residents, the cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.

Analysis

Because data centers are expected to consume between 11% and 12% of total U.S. power demand by 2030, states are scrambling to find ways to mitigate this load without raising prices for consumers. As Virginia is realizing, climate mandates can’t coexist with a functioning digital economy because AI requires reliable generation to operate. Entrenched utilities will have a difficult time working through the regulatory process to build enough firm generation to meet growing demand. Therefore, policymakers should allow firms to bypass public utilities and build new, independent power infrastructure. As the Cato Institute’s Travis Fisher and Jennifer Huddleston argue, “If the United States wants to lead the world in AI, policymakers must abandon the illusion that a centrally planned grid can power a decentralized technological revolution. Energy abundance and technological progress thrive when they are built on the same foundation: an open-ended market process with less government intervention.”",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bigstock-High-Voltage-Work-78711299.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:01:22.240024

The public supports strong protections from toxic chemicals Efforts to weaken TSCA are out of step with public opinion.","Toxic-Free Future, Safer States, and more than 250 state, local, and national public health and environmental groups sent a joint letter to Congress this week, urging lawmakers to reject the chemical lobby’s efforts to weaken the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the main federal law governing chemicals made, imported, or used in the U.S.

The letter comes as chemical industry lobbyists push Congress to reopen and roll back key public health protections added to TSCA in 2016, changes designed to fix decades of failure in the nation’s chemical safety system.

What’s happening

Since TSCA was updated in 2016, the chemical lobby has steadily worked to reopen the law and undo key reforms. Now, industry lobbyists see the current political environment as an opportunity to weaken this law.

EPA Administrator Zeldin has publicly stated that he wants EPA “to get out of the way” of industry. At the same time, chemical industry lobbyists have called for changes that would significantly limit EPA’s authority to fully review new chemicals before they enter the market. One industry demand is a return to a so-called “shot clock” approach, imposing rigid deadlines on EPA’s new chemical reviews, even when companies have failed to provide sufficient health and safety data.

These changes would dismantle the protections Congress put in place less than a decade ago and that have prevented harmful chemicals, including new PFAS, from entering the market.

Why it matters

Reopening TSCA is not about minor technical fixes. The chemical industry has made clear they want to roll back multiple provisions Congress passed in the bipartisan 2016 reforms, including safeguards that protect public health, the environment, and state authority.

At a January 2025 hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chemical industry lobbyists condemned the TSCA new chemicals program, which requires EPA to find that a chemical is safe before it enters the market. Industry groups claim this safeguard is “too burdensome.”

But Congress passed this safeguard for good reason.

Before the 2016 reforms, EPA routinely allowed chemical companies to introduce new chemicals into commerce with little to no health and safety data. Hundreds of PFAS and other dangerous chemicals entered the market under this broken system, leading to widespread pollution of our drinking water, air, and soil, and long-term exposures for millions of people.

Weakening TSCA now would repeat these same mistakes with serious consequences for public health.

Strong protections, fewer loopholes

The U.S. continues to see rising rates of chronic disease linked to chemical exposures. Thousands of chemicals can be found in our workplaces, homes, schools, and the environment, but only a small fraction have been independently studied or thoroughly assessed for their health and environmental impacts.

The most vulnerable among us—infants, children, pregnant women, workers, the elderly, and fenceline communities—are often the most exposed and the least protected.

We need stronger protections from toxic chemicals, not weaker.

The public supports strong protections from toxic chemicals

Efforts to weaken TSCA are out of step with public opinion. A recent poll found that 82% of voters favor TSCA, with strong bipartisan backing: 78% of Democrats, 81% of Independents, and 86% of Republicans. Protecting people from toxic chemicals is not a partisan issue, it’s a public health imperative.

What advocates are telling Congress

In the joint letter, organizations and groups urge lawmakers to stand firm against chemical lobby pressure:

“At a time when we must do more to protect our communities from chemical threats, we should not go backward. We urge that you stand strong against any weakening of TSCA and fight for an effective national program that delivers strong public health protections to all Americans.”

Take action

In addition to the joint sign-on letter, Toxic-Free Future activists and partners are urging members of Congress to reject chemical lobby efforts and defend TSCA’s public health protections.",https://toxicfreefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/TSCA-sign-on-letter-blog.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:01:00.815191

Energy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters Ford’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.
The grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China.
Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers.
Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.","Ford, a century after it launched the modern automotive era, has given up on its early ambitions to charge into the electrified future.

The company announced that it will delete nearly $20 billion in book value to extricate itself from its EV investments, an eye-popping loss that amounts to one of the biggest corporate impairments ever.

The company, of course, views it differently: The move is a ​“decisive redeployment of capital,” it said on Monday, as it rolled out a string of related strategic changes alongside the write-down.

The pivot hits particularly hard in the southeastern Battery Belt, where Ford had invested in multibillion-dollar BlueOval plants to produce batteries and electric vehicles. The EV battery facility in Glendale, Kentucky, will lay off about 1,600 employees, and local outlet the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported that a Ford factory in Tennessee will hire around 1,000 fewer workers than previously planned, now that it is making gas trucks instead of electric ones.

As Ford retreats from EVs, though, it’s enthusiastically embracing battery-making — announcing plans to repurpose the Kentucky plant to fuel its entrance into the grid storage market. It expects to spend roughly $2 billion over the next two years to launch production of lithium iron phosphate cells and package them into 20-foot containers that hold at least 5 megawatt-hours of storage capacity, equivalent to a Tesla Megapack. The plan is to ship at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

“This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford,” the company said in a statement. Ford also plans to make cells for home battery units at its factory in Marshall, Michigan.

Ford recently cut a deal with partner SK On, the South Korean battery maker, to dissolve their joint venture. Ford will keep the Kentucky battery plant while SK On takes the one at the sprawling BlueOval City complex near Memphis, Tennessee. That means batteries will still be made in that factory, just not exclusively for Ford products.

“They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at financial services firm Raymond James. ​“While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Ford’s sunny rhetoric about a ​“customer-driven shift” can’t hide the sheer enormity of the blow to its overall business.

As of Sept. 30, Ford’s accountants pegged its corporate value at more than $47 billion. Now Ford must lower that by $19.5 billion to reflect the dissolution of the joint venture agreement with SK On and the loss of planned EV models. The company will have to spend money to end production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, switch to producing a gas-and-battery-powered extended-range model, and retool factories for new, non-EV production.

The move comes as EVs account for just about 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S., far below the global figure of 25%. Though EV sales reach new records each year, the rate of growth has slowed, and there’s little reason to expect momentum to improve given recent federal policy changes.

“U.S. EV sales have never lived up to expectations,” said Molchanov. ​“That was true even while the tax credit was in place. Now, there’s no more tax credit, and EV sales have fallen off a proverbial cliff.”

The consumer EV tax credit ended in September as a result of the Republican budget law, taking away an incentive that helped lower or eliminate the premium for buying electric compared to a similar gas-powered model. Now, too, the average price of regular gasoline has dipped below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, while residential electricity prices rose 13% over the first three-quarters of this year, much faster than inflation.

“In terms of commodity prices, this is the worst of both worlds for EVs,” Molchanov said.

Energy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters

Ford’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.

It used to be that EVs were on the exponential growth curve, and stationary storage offered a modest side hustle for any leftover batteries. Now, between American automakers’ apparent inability to make affordable models and the Trump administration’s slashing and burning of federal EV incentives, that market is heading for some doldrums.

Grid battery providers, by contrast, are seeing business surge. Revenue from Tesla’s energy division, home to the Powerwall home battery and Megapack for large-scale storage, grew 67% last year compared to 2023, and broke $10 billion for the first time, even as the company’s market-leading EV business lost revenue.

Overall, the U.S. will install a record amount of battery capacity on the grid this year. Though analysts predict some dropoff over the next couple of years as the industry adapts to new federal anti-China rules, the utility-scale outlook through 2030 has actually increased 15% since the first half of this year, according to industry group American Clean Power.

Demand from AI data centers plays a massive role in that: Hyperscalers are realizing that strategically placed batteries can unlock capacity at critical constrained hours, in some cases letting the companies build computing hubs years earlier than they could if they waited for conventional grid upgrades. Ford, not coincidentally, will target data centers with its new battery products.

The grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China. But when President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, he preserved federal tax incentives for energy storage deployment while adding a new bureaucratic regime to make projects prove they don’t source parts from China in excess of newly set limits.

Starting in 2026, that will push storage developers to source U.S.-made batteries. There aren’t a lot of options today: LG, after making EV batteries in Michigan for years, began producing lithium iron phosphate cells there for grid use earlier this year. Tesla, Fluence, and others are following suit — in fact, the U.S. is on track for self-sufficiency in cell production for grid storage use by the end of 2026, according to the Energy Storage Coalition.

If project developers end up in a race to secure scarce domestic supply come 2027 or 2028, Ford could find eager buyers in spite of its short track record.

Still, that’s no guarantee of success. Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers. Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.

Put another way, Ford is copying Tesla’s strategy of leveraging EV prowess to sell grid storage, but doing so a decade later and without the EV prowess to lean on.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/04.01.25-KY-Plant-14.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=73c351b330ba4a22e35fbdf23cd8b3de,N,,2025-12-17 16:00:17.060412

In this last election, climate change was a defining issue in states like Virginia and Georgia, where voters grappled with rising energy costs. And no matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs—much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago—and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74% between 2008 and 2024—and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40% in the past two decades—meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes, and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island—site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history—to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution, and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources, and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills, and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100% renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access, and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans' energy costs soaring.

Sarah Nelson, assistant inspector general for the Energy Department's Office of Inspector General, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review ""whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are ""unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting ... intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are ""unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting ... intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.

The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect … Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”

That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.

Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

In Q3 2025, over 5.3 GW of energy storage was installed nationwide.
“Strong growth in the U.S. energy storage market reflects a simple reality: meeting rising demand and keeping the grid reliable increasingly requires storage,” said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis, ACP.
The residential energy storage market continues to make strides, installing 647 MW in Q3, marking the seventh consecutive growth quarter for the segment.
Community, commercial and industrial battery energy storage declined 8% year-on-year for Q3, installing 33 MW.","The US energy storage industry continues to mount impressive year-on-year growth, according to a quarterly report from Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

In Q3 2025, over 5.3 GW of energy storage was installed nationwide. Third-quarter installations increased 31% year-over-year. Q2 2025 remains the record quarter for deployments, with deployments decreasing in Q3 by 6% quarter-over-quarter.

Through three quarters, the industry has exceeded the total deployment of the full year 2024, said the report.

“Strong growth in the U.S. energy storage market reflects a simple reality: meeting rising demand and keeping the grid reliable increasingly requires storage,” said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis, ACP.

The utility-scale segment was the primary driver of capacity totals, with 4.6 GW of the 5.3 GW total carried by this segment, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Texas and California represented 82% of total utility-scale storage deployment.

The residential energy storage market continues to make strides, installing 647 MW in Q3, marking the seventh consecutive growth quarter for the segment. Residential energy storage deployments grew 70% year-over-year in Q3. Wood Mackenzie projects Q4 2025 will set a record for the residential sector as customers accelerate installations ahead of the Section 25D tax credit expiration. The residential segment’s shift toward third-party ownership models, which accounted for 57% of the market in Q3 2025, is helping to mitigate the impact of the Section 25D expiration, said the report.

Community, commercial and industrial battery energy storage declined 8% year-on-year for Q3, installing 33 MW. California represented 54% of installations in this segment. Wood Mackenzie said Illinois and Massachusetts have emerged as key markets for the segment. California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) 3.0, and Illinois’ rebate programs are expected to sustain steady deployment through 2029, said the report.

Wood Mackenzie increased its five-year forecast for utility-scale storage deployments by 15% compared to its projections released in the first half of 2025. It said that the market may plateau or even decline in 2026 and 2027.

“Although domestic battery manufacturing continues to ramp up to meet new tariffs and non-foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirements for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Wood Mackenzie projects near-term supply chain adjustments and constraints will drive an 11% contraction in the US utility-scale storage market in 2026 and an 8% decline in 2027,” said the report.

However, Wood Mackenzie expects strong recovery, with double-digit year-over-year growth in 2028 and 2029 as U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity comes online.

The firm forecasts nearly 93 GW of storage deployment across the U.S. in the next five years.

“Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_image004-1.png,N,,2025-12-17 19:04:21.043638

The joint venture was founded by eight carmakers (BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Toyota). Seven of them were present at the event, sharing their views on the entire project.

While the third part is dedicated more to hardcore EV charging enthusiasts, without flashy presentations, we noted a few interesting things.

The founding members of Ionna are EV manufacturers and competitors. However, they say the Ionna joint venture is a shared effort to address EV charging infrastructure challenges.

The companies agree that range anxiety is not as big an issue today as it was 10 or 15 years ago. There are already 300-mile EVs on the market. On the other hand, charging is a major barrier to growth in the EV segment.

The founding members agree that there is a gap between the EVs in North America and the available EV charging infrastructure. This specifically concerns DC fast chargers, but home charging has its issues, too, they believe.

The Ionna joint venture is intended to expand EV charging infrastructure, increasing the number of available chargers. We assume, although it was not said, that it’s important for other EV manufacturers to have a counterweight for the Tesla Supercharging network, which accounts for more than half of all DC fast-charging stalls in North America.

Ionna is expected to improve the situation quickly (“Ionna Speed”) and simultaneously enhance the overall user experience (reliability, amenities, Plug & Charge feature, high 400 kW power, and NACS connectors from day one).

A side element of the collaboration is the joint efforts and laboratories working to improve the reliability of charging by testing new models and developing software updates.

An interesting point is that, about two years ago, the founding members initially wanted to deploy CCS1 chargers exclusively. However, after adjusting the plan, the Ionna network launched with a 60% CCS1 / 40% NACS (SAE J3400) connector mix. In the future, the share of NACS chargers is expected to increase.

Ionna’s founding members are investing serious money into the company to install 30,000 DC fast-charging stalls by 2030. The financial aspects of the company’s plans were not discussed, although it was repeatedly stated that the goal is to make the network profitable at some point in the future.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251217-BASE-8-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:05:03.335604

Aggregating demand: Just as utility-scale solar and fleet EV purchases drove down costs, adaptation can benefit from collective purchasing.
Building an adaptation market starts with risk data Imagine a world where adaptation is fully integrated into economic and policy decisions.","At COP30, countries agreed within 10 years to triple support provided to developing nations for their adaptation priorities to increase resilience to climate change. This commitment comes at a critical moment. As progress to reduce planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels lags behind what scientists say is necessary, money is urgently needed to adapt to a warming world. And it’s worth the investment: every dollar spent on resilience yields ten times the return in avoided losses and economic benefits.

We need more decision-makers to understand this return on investment—and to do that, we need to build a market for adaptation solutions.

Climate impacts are accelerating faster than systems and societies can handle. This year alone, we witnessed 14 winter wildfires in Southern California and floods displacing millions from Texas to Nepal. At the same time, slow-onset impacts—like extreme heat, rising seas, and desertification—are reshaping cities, driving up food and energy costs, and threatening jobs and livelihoods. The adaptation gap and the affordability crisis are closely linked.

The reality is clear: climate change is already costing us. What we need now is a shift in mindset. Investing in adaptation today—proactively—will make our economies and communities safer and more prosperous well into the future.

Market roadblocks to adaptation

One reason adaptation lags behind is market failure. Traditionally, adaptation has relied almost entirely on public funding. While essential, public dollars alone won’t get us where we need to go. We must mobilize private capital and create market conditions that reward resilience.

Moreover, right now, markets don’t adequately price climate risks or value climate resilience. Risks remain invisible, resilience isn’t rewarded, and proven adaptation technologies and services fail to reach the people who need them most.

Taking a page from the clean energy playbook

The market challenges we face on adaptation are not new. In fact, we faced similar barriers when building clean energy markets. But today, renewable energy is often cheaper than fossil fuels because we created incentives, set standards, aggregated demand, and raised awareness. We can apply pages from this market-building playbook to drive access to and affordability of adaptation solutions.

Think about what drove clean energy adoption: electric vehicle mandates, Energy Star certification, LEED building standards, and tax incentives for solar. These tools spurred investment, scaled demand, and brought down costs. Adaptation needs its own version of these market drivers.

To make resilience visible, valuable, and investable—and do it at scale—will require shifting adaptation from primarily an emergency response to a more proactive, long-term economic strategy. Here’s what that looks like:

Creating incentives: Just as renewable energy tax credits and EV mandates boosted innovation and investor confidence, adaptation is following a similar path. For example, resilience bonds in cities like Miami link infrastructure upgrades to reduced insurance premiums, offsetting a portion of the cost of flood protection. Or look to policy mandates like those in Puerto Rico for community solar, which have catalyzed investment in energy systems that are both low-carbon and storm-resilient.

Aggregating demand: Just as utility-scale solar and fleet EV purchases drove down costs, adaptation can benefit from collective purchasing. If we can unite stakeholders to pool together investment in adaptation solutions and technologies, then we can drive demand up and price down. For example, EDF’s work with dairy entrepreneurs in India shows how coordinated adoption of climate-smart practices reduces costs and improves resilience. The 3-month program, launched in 2024, has now trained 120 rural entrepreneurs, with 130 more on deck, in dairy science, livestock rearing and business, with a focus on sustainable and climate-smart strategies that also improve bottom lines.

Setting standards: Energy Star and LEED transformed clean energy markets. Adaptation is beginning to benefit from similar benchmarks. The FORTIFIED Home™program certifies hurricane-resilient buildings, and states like Alabama, South Carolina and Florida offer homeowners incentives, grants and credits to make their homes safer with retrofits and materials that meet these standards. More broadly, we see an opportunity to align resilience metrics for infrastructure and supply chains with international frameworks to guide credible, risk-informed decisions.

Raising awareness: Just as clean energy campaigns highlight savings and benefits, adaptation needs compelling narratives. Research shows that adaptation investments can yield up to $10 for every $1 invested—but few communities are aware of this return on investment. The more we can arm decision-makers in communities, companies and government with information on risks, costs and returns on investment in resilience, the more we can work together to implement adaptation solutions that work.

Building an adaptation market starts with risk data

Imagine a world where adaptation is fully integrated into economic and policy decisions. The climate-resilient choice becomes the common sense, economically sensible choice. That means:

Building in ways that account for changing shorelines, wind speeds, and extreme heat.

Families accessing affordable tools to reduce wildfire and flood damage.

Businesses factoring climate risk into supply chain decisions.

To achieve this, we need to start with data: high-confidence, high-precision climate risk data for specific locations and industries. Then we pair it with economic modeling to understand the benefit-cost implications of adaptation options. This approach isn’t new, but what’s different now is the quality of data we have to act on. If companies, community and government decision makers can better understand the risk they face, the resilient choice can become the obvious and economically sensible choice.

To go beyond pledges and negotiations, governments, businesses and investors must work together to make resilience visible, valuable, and investable. True success means factoring in the real costs of climate impacts today, so we don’t just survive a changing climate—we protect lives, strengthen economies, and unlock opportunity. Because when we invest in resilience today, we secure a safer, more prosperous tomorrow.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//iStock-841448806.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:00:33.994389

The U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) on December 16 told TransAlta, a Calgary, Canada-based independent power producer (IPP), to keep the 730-MW, coal-fired Centralia Unit 2 online. DOE Secretary Chris Wright, as he and his agency have alleged in previous orders, said the region faces an energy emergency.

Officials in several states, along with power industry experts, have said no such emergency exists, although several agencies—including grid operators—have warned that increasing demand for electricity, including from artificial intelligence and data centers, threatens grid reliability.

It is not known how the DOE order could also affect TransAlta’s recently announced plan to switch the Centralia unit to burn natural gas. TransAlta on December 17 said the company is evaluating the DOE’s order. TransAlta on Wednesday said it would provide more information once available.

For more insight into how the Trump administration is using emergency orders in the energy sector, read “Federal Grid Interventions Enter a Second Phase as DOE Extends Emergency Orders,” published by POWER earlier this year.

“The shutdown of our last coal plant [in Washington] is two weeks away, and now the Trump administration has manufactured a fake emergency ordering TransAlta to keep burning coal against everyone’s wishes,” said Patti Goldman, an Earthjustice attorney, in a statement.

There is bipartisan support for keeping coal-fired power plants online. The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed legislation aimed at forcing utilities to keep coal-fired units operating beyond their scheduled retirement dates. The Republican-backed bill has support from some Democrats.

The “Power Plant Reliability Act,” H.R. 3632, is sponsored by Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.). The bill, which passed 222-202, would grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) new authority to require utilities to continue operating power plants if their closure would threaten reliability of the power grid.

“Nothing can be more destructive to our communities than a blackout,” said House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy Chair Bob Latta (R-Ohio). “When a state seeks to close a power plant without identifying sufficient replacement, there is little recourse for consumers.”

More Operational Orders on Tap

Tuesday’s order signed by Wright said closing the plant “could lead to the potential loss of power to homes, businesses, and facilities [in the region] critical to the national defense in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.” The DOE, citing Federal Power Act section 202(c), already has told coal-fired plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to remain online. Industry analysts have said at least five other coal-fired plants—all set to retire at the end of 2025—could also be ordered to remain in operation.

“The last administration’s energy subtraction policies had the United States on track to experience significantly more blackouts in the coming years—thankfully, President Trump won’t let that happen,” said Wright. “The Trump administration will continue taking action to keep America’s coal plants running so we can stop the price spikes and ensure we don’t lose critical generation sources. Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy to heat their homes all the time, regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”

Legal challenges to the DOE’s orders already are underway in federal court, with the cases centered on Consumer Energy’s coal-fired 1,420-MW J.H. Campbell power plant in West Olive, Michigan, and Constellation Energy’s two 380-MW gas- and oil-fired units at its Eddystone power plant near Philadelphia. The suits in part charge that the DOE has not shown any evidence of energy emergencies that would impact the plant’s service territories.

The grid operators for both Michigan and Pennsylvania— the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and the PJM Interconnection (PJM), respectively—had signed off on the closures, saying retirements of the power plants would not impact the reliability of the power supply in either region.

The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School earlier this year wrote that “Government research and independent assessments (from RMI, also known as the Rocky Mountain Institute and Energy Innovation) contradict President Trump’s findings about insufficient energy supply and grid unreliability.” The group also noted, “There are, of course, legitimate grid reliability challenges to tackle, such as those brought on by increased extreme weather events caused by climate change. But evidence suggests that current energy supply and price conditions simply do not constitute a national emergency.”

The DOE’s emergency order for Centralia noted, “The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) determined in its 2025-2026 Winter Reliability Assessment that the WECC Northwest region is at elevated risk during periods of extreme weather, such as prolonged, far-reaching cold snaps.”

90-Day Order

Wright in issuing a 90-day emergency order ordered the Centralia unit to remain running until March 16, 2026. Wright said the plant should operate under the auspices of either the Bonneville Power Administration—in its role as a balancing authority in the Pacific Northwest— or the California Independent System Operator, which is the reliability coordinator for the region.

Washington legislators passed a state law ordering the Centralia plant to retire, and Unit 1 at the site was retired by TransAlta in 2020. The state’s Clean Energy Transformation Act bans the use of coal to produce electricity starting in 2026; Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said the order issued Tuesday would violate that law.

TransAlta’s financial filings show the IPP has sold the power produced at Centralia on a merchant basis and through long-term contracts.

Opponents of keeping U.S. coal-fired plants operating past their scheduled retirements have said the cost of continuing operations will fall on ratepayers. Consumers Energy in an October filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote that the costs of complying with the order for the Campbell plant—which was scheduled to close in May—had reached $80 million through the end of September. The utility said the cost of operating the plant was being paid by ratepayers in Michigan and 10 other states.

Earthjustice and other advocacy groups have said the emergency orders amount to a “power grab” by the Trump administration. The groups have argued that forcing what they call “unreliable and uneconomic” power plants to stay online will lead to higher bills for ratepayers, and will threaten the health of those in communities served by the facilities.

Wright told TransAlta to propose tariff revisions, or seek waivers with FERC, “as needed” to pay for operations at Centralia. Wright said rate recovery is available through the federal regulation governing energy emergencies.

Officials have said that with regard to the plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Consumers Energy and Constellation will be paid via charges imposed by MISO and PJM on the loads on their systems. Officials said that’s because the emergency orders for the Campbell and Eddystone plants were directed to MISO and PJM, not the power plant owners. Consumers Energy in its October SEC filing said its costs to continue operating the Campbell facility totaled $164 million from May through September, but said it was able to offset a portion of those costs through $84 million of revenue it earned from selling power to the MISO system.

TransAlta earlier this month announced it had agreed to sell Puget Sound Energy electricity, capacity. and ancillary services across a 15-year period starting late in 2028, after the Centralia plant was converted to burn natural gas. TransAlta had said it expected to make a final investment decision on the project after receiving needed regulatory approvals from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, which are expected in 2027.

Other coal-fired units that had been scheduled to close by year-end include:

The 590-MW Big Cajun II Unit 3 in Louisiana (part owned by Entergy).

The 90-MW F.B. Culley 2 in Indiana (CenterPoint Energy).

The 772-MW R.M. Schahfer power station in Indiana (Northern Indiana Public Service Co.).

The 335-MW Comanche 2 in Colorado (Public Service Co. of Colorado/Xcel Energy).

The 427-MW Craig 1 in Colorado (jointly owned by PacifiCorp, Platte River Power Authority, Salt River Project, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, and Public Service Co. of Colorado/Xcel Energy).

Merrillville, Indiana-based Northern Indiana Public Service Co., known as NIPSCO, already has filed plans to build a 2.3-GW natural gas-fired power plant at the Schahfer site in Wheatfield. The utility, which earlier said it would build a gas-fired peaker plant at the location, has said new generation is needed to support potential load growth from data centers.

Xcel Energy in November filed a petition with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to extend operations at its 50-year-old Comanche 2 unit in Pueblo for an additional year. The agency approved the petition earlier this month. The utility has said the generation from Unit 2 is needed because the 750-MW Unit 3 at the site—scheduled for closure in 2031—has been offline since mid-summer due to “notable damage,” and is not expected to return to service for several months.

The Craig 1 unit in northwest Colorado also is expected to continue to operate. Mark Stutz, a Tri-State spokesperson, earlier this month told POWER that the utility “expects to receive an order before the end of the year” to keep the Craig unit operational. Stutz said Tri-State is following the court cases filed around the earlier emergency orders.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/centralia-power-plant-september-2020-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:01:47.407526

This trend saw solar capture prices across ERCOT's three hubs fall around $21.50 on average to a price near $30.25/MWh, a decrease from Dec. 14 just under 41%. Conversely, Dec. 14-15 ERCOT's total wind supply fell 79.47 GWh, or around 24%, generating 253.5 GWh of wind power Dec. 15. This caused its capture rates to significantly rise as regional demand grew, with ERCOT's South and West locations rising around $121 and $37, respectively, to prices of $135.80/GWh and $59.52/MWh. MISO Capture prices were mixed within the Midcontinent Independent System Operator Dec. 15, with the Indiana wind hub and Louisiana solar hub experiencing the greatest regional change on day. Indiana's wind hub rose just under $19 to price at $76.83/MWh, while Louisiana's solar hub rose $8.31 to $40.32/MWh. Explaining the rise in wind capture rates, total supply Dec. 14-15 fell 23.19 GWh, or 6.61%, to 327.76 GWh. Meanwhile, peakload demand increased 5.70 GW, or just under 10%, to 102.8 GW. — Ricardo Plata iii, ricardo.plata.iii@spglobal.com-- Edited by Ashanti Rojano, newsdesk@spglobal.com--Platts Electricity Alert--",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:02:11.310643

The bill would boost clean, American manufacturing and cut industrial pollution in the United States and abroad.

The bill would encourage American manufacturers to reduce emissions, and protect those that do, by placing a fee on the worst polluters in carbon-intensive sectors like fossil fuels, aluminum, steel, and cement. The fee, which would also apply to imports, ensures that global bad actors do not undercut innovative American producers that have invested in lowering pollution.

Revenue from the polluter fee would be reinvested into domestic industrial decarbonization projects so that companies with high-emitting facilities have the opportunity to upgrade and meet standards. Additional revenue would be set aside to support clean industry and the transition away from carbon-intensive manufacturing practices globally, which would ensure a level playing field for American manufacturers. Crucially, it would expand the global market for low-carbon goods made with processes successfully deployed in the United States and amongst trade partners.

As a result, the Clean Competition Act of 2025 clears a path to decarbonize US industry by 2050 and improves the marketability of US industry’s products.

In response, Sierra Club Industrial Transformation Campaign Lead Harry Manin issued the following statement:

“The Trump administration only pays lip service to American manufacturing, while giving a pass to pollution-cheats and raising prices on consumers. The Clean Competition Act takes the opposite approach of Trump’s handouts to polluters by rewarding companies who do the right thing and those who want to invest in innovation and promote health and efficiency. It seeks to level the global playing field by raising standards around the world, instead of exacerbating a race to the bottom that increases pollution and decreases wages. We are grateful for Sen. Whitehouse and Rep. DelBene’s leadership and urge all champions of American manufacturing, clean air, and a livable climate to support the bill.”

At times, it felt relentless: enough to take your breath away. Many of us knew that 2025 was going to be a ride since we’ve lived through this before. We just didn’t know how much of it we’d see again—and at what cadence.

It turns out the answer was a rapid-fire one. Project 2025 primed President Trump to come back into the Oval Office with no hesitation about his game plan. He issued 26 executive orders on his first day, quickly established himself as a pro–fossil fuel president, handed Elon Musk the tools needed to strip key science agencies of their staff, and began chipping away at environmental initiatives started under Obama and strengthened by Biden. He pushed Congress to largely defang Biden’s capstone Inflation Reduction Act and followed that up with the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which didn’t extend tax credits for electric vehicles and placed new restrictions on energy tax credits.

Looking back at what transpired on a policy level last year is rather astounding—but that’s just part of the story. As readers of The Understory know, it’s important to view this past year from all angles.

With this final newsletter of 2025, I wanted to take stock of what occurred over the past year by first looking at details that might have been lost in the headlines—or that only make sense in retrospect. I wanted to assess how much the White House really did, how many changes we saw, and how those shifts affected our lived experiences. Some of the numbers might surprise you.

From a climate perspective, there were major policy blows and setbacks when it came to slowing emissions and protecting the planet in the face of global warming.

Let’s start with the hard facts. In 2025, there were:

221 executive orders signed by the White House, 20 of which pertained specifically to energy or climate

1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters proposed to be opened to offshore drilling for the first time

A 27% decrease in electric vehicle sales from January to November

A 1.1% rise in global emissions, a record high

Just a 2-cent decrease in the national average price of gas from January to November

Q: Looking back on 2025, what do you think was the top upset for you when it comes to climate change, energy, or the environment? Something that you felt at the time, and perhaps still feel now, was incredibly jarring?

“The big one is the absolute passivity of Congress in the face of all this. The environmental movement of the 1970s was embodied in the legislation adopted in the period between 1970 and 1990. At that time, Congress focused in great detail on the environmental challenges facing the country. Now, as we face new challenges, Congress is nowhere to be found except in partisan sound bites untethered to facts, and has abdicated its oversight role … The current situation is unlike anything I ever saw in my 39 years with EPA.” –Stan Meiburg, former acting EPA administrator under Obama

“The previous administration had put us on a hopeful path to combat climate change with the Inflation Reduction Act. The illegal termination of grant programs, like the $7 billion Solar For All program, has profound implications for climate change, as well as deeply harmful impacts to communities all over the United States.” -Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center

“For too many, 2025 was a year of great sadness, fear, and loss. As a D.C. resident and a proud former federal employee, the dismantling of federal agencies and protections has been deeply concerning—specifically, how openly the Trump administration has stepped away from its basic responsibility to serve the people. Almost overnight, critical programs have been gutted, experts sidelined, and enforcement tools weakened without regard for the impacts.” -Corey Solow, legislative director for climate and energy at Earthjustice

“The first six months of the year were the costliest six months of weather disasters in U.S. history. More pollution’s only going to make those disasters more destructive, drive up insurance costs, and threaten home values.” -Joanna Slaney, vice president, political affairs and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund

“In August, the Trump Administration announced NASA would decommission satellites that are collecting climate and pollution data, despite the fact that they have already been paid for, and that operating costs were low. The Trump Administration is choosing to *pay* to stop having information. That, among other things, is a sign that this administration is not only governing by medieval ideology, but aiming to destroy any competing forms of knowledge. When a government recognizes data and information as its enemy, it has entered dystopia.” -Shi-Ling Hsu, environmental law professor at Florida State University College of Law

“What’s incredibly jarring to me has been the use of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to criminally investigate current and former EPA employees working on climate change programs. These mafioso-like tactics are part of a well-planned effort by the administration to intimidate public employees and create false narratives around programs that they use to destroy.” -Tim Whitehouse, executive director for the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility

Q: Considering that same time period, what is something that happened, or you’ve experienced or heard, that gives you hope?

“I have been encouraged by the resilience of some states, local groups, and communities, especially in the area of renewable energy. Despite massive propaganda efforts by the administration, both communities and businesses continue to discover that renewable energy, such as combinations of solar power and battery storage, are cheaper and faster to build and use than fossil fuel alternatives … Doing the right thing for the environment is being reframed, as it should, as also doing the right thing for our wallets—making health care and energy more affordable while improving our quality of life.” –Stan Meiburg, former acting EPA administrator under Obama

“Earthjustice and our partners are appearing before state public utility commissions to push back on utility plans to continue relying on aging coal plants to produce electricity. In Kentucky, we successfully argued before the Public Service Commission to require the utility to consider retiring coal plants and develop plans to implement energy efficiency and demand response programs. Meanwhile, our Right to Zero campaign is driving city, state, and regional action to electrify our transportation, homes, buildings, and industries and build a zero-emissions future for all.” -Corey Solow, legislative director for climate and energy at Earthjustice

“The elections in November were a referendum on energy prices—and people voted enthusiastically for candidates who said they were going to do something about it, and that included more clean, reliable, affordable energy. The results are clear: people want more choices. They want lower prices. That’s not what they’ve been getting.” –Joanna Slaney, vice president, political affairs and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund

“About five years ago, I realized that the same question was rising to the top of the questions I was receiving at nearly every talk I was giving, whether to high school students or architects: ‘What gives you hope?’ (or sometimes the flip side, ‘Are we screwed?’) … Hope itself is not an emotion: It is a choice, a practice, and a conviction that what we do will make a difference. In a nutshell, it’s action! Not only our own, but being aware of and sharing that of others… We are long past the time when we need to search for hope. Instead, the right question to ask is: “What are you doing to create hope?” Share your actions with others and learn and share about theirs, too. That is how we create hope together.” –Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy

Q. When it comes to looking ahead to 2026, what do you think will be a defining area of interest that will or should take up the news cycle when it comes to energy, environmental, and climate news?

“The explosion of AI has generated plenty of headlines, but the impacts of unchecked data-center expansion on public health and the environment must be at the forefront of the conversation. These massive data centers often consume as much energy as an entire city. The Trump administration is using projected AI energy demand as an excuse to prop up coal and gas plants, increasing pollution and delaying our transition to clean energy while leaving communities footing the bill through higher electricity rates.” -Corey Solow, legislative director for climate and energy at Earthjustice

“There is no question that climate-fueled disasters are on the rise: from disastrous wildfires across North America to unprecedented cyclones and typhoons in southeast Asia…Sadly, so too will [increase] the misinformation and disinformation that surround them, hampering the accurate communication of facts and efforts to assist with risk mitigation and recovery: an issue which is also at the very top of the World Economic Forum’s risks list! These risks are no longer distant; they are literally affecting the air we breathe, the cost of the food we eat, the quality of the water we drink, and even the expenses of the homes we maintain.” –Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy

“What I am looking for in 2026 are signs that China will be exporting its solar panels to less-developed countries, and that China might undertake leadership on emissions reductions, perhaps working more closely with the EU. That remains a pretty speculative possibility, but since Europe now finds itself utterly alone, there may be scope for a bargain with the only remaining rational (if still authoritarian and evil) superpower.” –Shi-Ling Hsu, environmental law professor at Florida State University College of Law

“The wheels are coming off the bus, so to speak—the bus being the administration. This means this coming year will be even more dangerous for this country than the past year. It will be important that those who report the news not overlook the important energy, environmental, and climate trends and issues that we need to address as a country in the midst of what will be a chaotic and difficult year politically.” -Tim Whitehouse, executive director for the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility

“Insight will come from the Court’s decisions about the ability of the executive branch to rescind or ‘claw back’ funds appropriated to Congress, especially for renewable energy and disadvantaged communities. Given that the administration seems to have abdicated its role in environmental enforcement, courts are also likely to see more citizen suit cases whose outcomes will be worth watching.” –Stan Meiburg, former acting EPA administrator under Obama

“I think we will start to get some clarity on where grantees can get relief for the illegal termination of their grants. As these cases start to reach final judgment, we could hope to see a big influx of funding back into programs to combat climate change.” -Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/climate-year-globe-hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 15:00:10.297186

Teschendorf (Germany) - Energiequelle GmbH has officially commissioned a new wind farm in Teschendorf, Lower Saxony, featuring five Enercon turbines of the E 138 type. Each turbine has a capacity of 4.2 megawatts, resulting in a total wind farm capacity of 21 MW.

Energiequelle expects the wind farm to generate an annual energy yield of around 60 million kilowatt-hours. This could supply approximately 17,000 households with CO₂-free electricity.

According to Energiequelle, the project’s implementation was lengthy: the regional planning phase took ten years, followed by a two-year zoning procedure. Construction work began in June 2024, and the project was completed as planned in October 2025.

In addition to contributing to the energy transition, the wind farm provides financial benefits for the region. A total of around three million euros will flow to the city of Wittingen and the surrounding districts of Teschendorf, Küstorf, Schneflingen, and Mahnburg. Of this, around 120,000 euros per year go to the municipality under § 6 of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG), while the Energiequelle Foundation provides an additional 15,000 euros per year. Furthermore, a 200-euro electricity bonus per household is granted to registered local residents over ten years – for approximately 180 households, this amounts to around 360,000 euros.

The Teschendorf wind farm serves as an example of successful acceptance work: transparent information and direct financial participation of residents are seen as key factors for local support of wind energy projects. Project manager Tina Hermerding also emphasizes the importance of involving the community: “In order to create acceptance for projects in the field of renewable energies, it is important to involve people and the community financially.”

On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) proposed a revised definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (Proposed Rule). The Trump administration announced that the Proposed Rule would “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.”

The new definition is expected to reduce the number of streams and wetlands that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and will impact several federal regulatory programs, including Section 404 permitting of impacts to regulated waters. The agencies drafted the Proposed Rule to closely mirror the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which held that the Clean Water Act extends to “relatively permanent” bodies of water connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to those waters.

The Proposed Rule adds definitions for several terms, including “relatively permanent,” “tributary,” “continuous surface connection,” “prior converted cropland,” and “ditch.”

The public comment period will begin when the Proposed Rule is published in the Federal Register. If finalized, it will replace the Biden administration’s 2023 definition of WOTUS. The definition of WOTUS has changed several times in the last decade. Each new definition has been challenged in the courts.

Bryan Hanson, chief generation officer of nuclear juggernaut Constellation Energy, told WGN News of Constellation's Byron location, ""If you add it up, over 2 million homes get their electricity just from this single plant.""

Nuclear power is one of many viable alternatives to dirty fuels. Unlike solar and wind, nuclear does not rely on unpredictable weather to work. Plus, nuclear power plants don't pollute the atmosphere. In fact, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, over 430 million tons of carbon dioxide were not released into the atmosphere in 2023, thanks to the use of nuclear energy.

However, there are downsides.

One of the many common misconceptions about nuclear energy is that it's renewable. Unfortunately, it's not. While its lack of air pollution gives it a leg up on dirty fuels, most nuclear power plants require uranium, a non-renewable resource, to make energy.

Uranium's radioactivity also poses a health risk. The mining process leaves behind radioactive waste, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has contaminated groundwater at former mining sites.

The reasons behind nuclear power aren't exactly environmentally friendly, either. As AI grows, so does the demand for power. Gil Quiniones, ComEd CEO, told WGN, ""The surge in load growth in certain regions of our country is because of AI and AI data centers. We've never seen this kind of growth.""

While nuclear-powered AI is a better alternative to data centers powered by dirty fuels, it still consumes a non-renewable resource at a rapid rate. According to the MIT Technology Review, the carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers is 48% higher than the U.S. average.

Even though their energy consumption is higher than average, these data centers often leave average American families to foot the bill.

So, while nuclear is the better option, there's still work to be done. Thankfully, there are researchers out there who are committed to doing it. For example, a government lab in Tennessee is 3D printing building materials for nuclear power plants, cutting down on construction costs and resources.

Yes, nuclear energy's reputation is complicated. Still, one thing is clear: Illinois is undoubtedly at the forefront of this shifting energy landscape.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Rj0q1wLuARYUSz49_wbU2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/afc307be19d3ad7f8048c7624cb69f07,N,,2025-12-17 17:03:59.742360

With FY2026 Budget on the Line, Former EPA Leaders Urge Congress to Advance Senate’s Bipartisan Bill to Halt the Dismantling of Protections to Americans’ Health

“Congress now has the first real opportunity to put some checks on this serial shutdown and to reaffirm that Americans still expect EPA to do its job.”

Washington D.C. – Former EPA leaders and policy experts from the Environmental Protection Network today urged Congress to reject deep House-proposed cuts to EPA’s budget and instead adopt the bipartisan Senate FY2026 appropriations bill, which preserves core health, safety, science, and clean water protections.

In a press briefing at the close of what speakers described as “a year of serial shutdown inside EPA,” EPN experts pointed to the deliberate pattern of weakened protections, sidelined science, and staff attrition has left Americans more exposed to toxic chemicals and environmental hazards.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

EPA’s Ability to Protect Americans is Being Dismantled

Marc Boom, EPN Senior Director of Public Affairs, opened the briefing with a clear warning: “For nearly a year, political appointees have taken step after step that add up to a serial shutdown of EPA’s ability to protect people’s health. The result is simple: more unsafe air, more contaminated water, and fewer safeguards when pollution or industrial accidents occur.”

Boom outlined multiple actions taken in the past 11 months, including proposals to weaken PFAS protections, delays on toxic wastewater standards, weakened mercury pollution rules, and plans to eliminate EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD).

He emphasized the real-world impacts: higher cancer risks, more lead exposure, greater PFAS contamination, and longer delays in identifying hazardous chemicals.

House vs. Senate: A Clear Choice for Congress

EPN experts stressed that with the federal funding deadline approaching, lawmakers face a consequential decision:

The House Bill: Deep Cuts that Endanger Communities

23% cut to EPA’s budget

Major cuts to enforcement—limiting the agency’s ability to hold polluters accountable

Slashing science funding and enabling plans to close ORD

Cutting millions from clean water revolving funds, jeopardizing states’ ability to address lead pipes, PFAS, and failing water systems

“These cuts translate directly into harm: Slower cleanups, fewer inspections, and higher risks for families,” said Boom.

The Senate Bill: A Bipartisan Plan that Preserves Core Protections

5% cut to EPA’s FY25 budget

Blocks closure of ORD, with Senate appropriators calling that proposal “appalling” and posing “immeasurable risk”

Maintains state clean water revolving funds

Passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 26–2

“Passing the Senate bill would send a powerful message that Americans want real guardians on the job protecting their health and safety,” Boom said.

States Will Feel the Cuts First—and Hardest

David Coursen, former EPA attorney, highlighted that EPA’s budget is also state funding: “States depend on EPA and federal money for a substantial part of their core budget, so they really need this money to operate.”

Coursen and others noted significant cuts in the House bill to state revolving funds that provide money to states that help municipal water systems provide safe drinking water.

Budget cuts in the House bill would mean:

More brown water at the tap

More stormwater contamination

More illness

Higher water bills for families who can least afford it.

Science on the Chopping Block: ORD and the Health Risks

Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former Acting Assistant Administrator for ORD, detailed the danger in eliminating EPA’s scientific backbone: “Dismantling EPA’s Office of Research and Development would devastate the agency’s ability to protect us from legacy pollution, emerging threats. … Guarding against chemicals like PFAS, lead, and wildfire smoke and other harms really depends on sound policy, sound enforcement that’s built around the foundation of sound science.”

She emphasized ORD’s essential role in:

Chemical risk assessments

Disaster response

Supporting states and Tribal Nations with actionable science

Without ORD, Orme-Zavaleta said, “America will no longer have the benefit of the world’s premier environmental health research organization to help us understand the impacts of toxic pollution and other environmental threats.”

ADDITIONAL KEY QUOTES

Marc Boom, former EPA Senior Advisor on policy and EPN Senior Advisor

“We’re here today because Congress now has the first real opportunity to put some checks on this serial shutdown and to reaffirm that Americans still expect EPA to do its job.”

“This is a moment of choice for Congress. Passing the Senate approach would send a clear message that the serial shutdown of the EPA must be reined in, that congressional intent must be followed, that Americans still expect guardians on the job protecting their health and safety.”

“The bill reported out of the House Appropriations Committee … would cut EPA’s budget still by a very large 23%. And that would mean slash enforcement funding, deep cuts to science, a reduction of $1.7 billion, or more than 60%, in what’s available through the state revolving funds for communities that rely on those to keep their drinking water safe.”

David Coursen, former attorney in EPA’s Office of General Counsel

“This is a lot more than just talking about taking money away from EPA. It’s taking money from the whole regulatory structure, superstructure. And so it’s important to bear that in mind and recognize that states are going to lose a lot of money here. There are grants that go to states and federal assistance that goes to states and logistical support and state revolving (funds that go) to the states.”

Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former Acting Assistant Administrator of EPA’s Office of Research and Development

“Congress has the chance right now to put up a giant stop sign. Adopting the Senate proposal is the clearest way to protect Americans’ health and safety.”

“EPA’s first administrator had three guiding principles for the agency, which has been followed for most of the agency’s 55 years of existence, which is to follow the science, follow the law, and be transparent. Science is really foundational to EPA in its ability to achieve its mission, and now it’s at risk.”

EPN has commended the Senate for taking a bipartisan approach to the FY 2026 budget and opposed the massive, partisan cuts to EPA proposed by President Trump (a 55% cut) and by the House.

“While this transition is challenging, it does not define our future, Semiconductor Research Corp. CEO Todd Younkin said in an emailed statement to The News & Observer.
University and private sector funding announced alongside the CHIPS award gave SMART USA more than $1 billion to operate.
She also said SRC’s longer-running semiconductor research projects remain active.
SMART USA is one of 18 Manufacturing USA institutes, a nationwide group of public-private centers designed to advance domestic manufacturing.","The U.S. Department of Commerce has canceled CHIPS funding for a major semiconductor research center near Research Triangle Park, citing “refocused” priorities under President Donald Trump.

This comes less than a year after the Biden administration awarded the Durham nonprofit Semiconductor Research Corp. a five-year, $285-million contract to launch Semiconductor Manufacturing and Advanced Research with Twins, or SMART USA, an institute designed to improve domestic semiconductor manufacturing through the use of virtual replicas known as digital twins.

“While this transition is challenging, it does not define our future, Semiconductor Research Corp. CEO Todd Younkin said in an emailed statement to The News & Observer. “We have united the semiconductor community for decades, and will continue to do so.”

Founded in 1982, SRC is a consortium that manages university research to benefit its members, including the tech companies IBM, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Semiconductors are a category of materials in the chips that power a range of applications, from cell phones to electric vehicles to fighter jets. Their importance to the U.S. economy and national security propelled passage of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which allocated more than $10 billion to support research and development initiatives.

On Jan. 3, the Commerce Department finalized its SMART USA award, one of many CHIPS contracts the outgoing Biden administration signed in the weeks before Trump’s inauguration. The institute opened at SRC’s campus to the east of RTP.

Digital twinning aims to save time and money by allowing researchers to pinpoint and patch production inefficiencies in a virtual space. It also facilitates greater information sharing between partners, said Laurie Locascio, then-undersecretary of commerce for standards and technology, during an event announcing SMART USA in November 2024.

U.S. Commerce steers CHIPS toward ‘venture-capital’ mindset

Under Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has sought to bring “a more venture capital-style approach” to the CHIPS Research and Development Office, informing recipients the federal government may seek equity, royalties or revenue sharing as a condition of awards. In August, the Department reversed Biden’s policy to create a nonprofit called Natcast to operate a $7.4 billion national hub for semiconductor research, choosing instead to administer these CHIPS funds itself.

“The Department of Commerce has opted to terminate its award to the SMART USA Institute, as the Administration’s vision for the CHIPS Research and Development program has been refocused to advance the President’s stated agenda of securing the U.S.’s position as the unrivaled world leader in critical and emerging technologies,” a spokesperson for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which oversees the R&D program, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.

Semicondcutor Research Corp. met all performance benchmarks under its contract, SRC spokesperson Paris Stringfellow said. SMART USA has 121 members, she noted in an email to The N&O, and the future of the nascent institute is unclear. University and private sector funding announced alongside the CHIPS award gave SMART USA more than $1 billion to operate.

SRC says the government told them of the termination on Dec. 10 The Triangle Business Journal first reported on the award ending Monday.

Stringfellow declined to share whether SRC received any money through its now-cancelled award but said the nonprofit had finished the initial phase of its contract. She also said SRC’s longer-running semiconductor research projects remain active.

SMART USA is one of 18 Manufacturing USA institutes, a nationwide group of public-private centers designed to advance domestic manufacturing. SRC said it is unaware of others in this network losing federal funding.

The remaining 10 percent would have to be offset through the use of low-carbon EU steel, e-fuels or biofuels.
In a statement, the Commission insisted the plans were consistent with the EU's 2050 climate targets but take a ""pragmatic"" approach.
German environment minister Carsten Schneider said the proposal gives automakers ""greater leeway to manage the transition to the electric future.""
Martin Kaiser, head of Greenpeace Germany, said the EU is gifting Chinese electric carmakers an ""early Christmas present"" and ""sacrificing Europe's climate goals.""","German chancellor Friedrich Merz and European carmakers welcomed proposed changes to the European Union's post-2035 rules on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars, backing what they described as a more flexible, technology-neutral approach to cutting emissions.

""More openness to technology and more flexibility are the right steps to take so as to better align climate targets, market realities, businesses and jobs,"" said Merz, adding that regulations shouldn't lead to ""more bureaucracy"".

The new proposal, which still needs approval from EU member states and the European Parliament, would replace the 2035 deadline to register new combustion engines with a requirement to cut tailpipe emissions by 90 percent. The remaining 10 percent would have to be offset through the use of low-carbon EU steel, e-fuels or biofuels. It also includes incentives aimed at boosting the bloc's battery industry.

The European Commission proposal follows intense lobbying from countries like Germany and Italy as well as many of the continent's automakers, forcing the proposed changes against a backdrop of sluggish car sales, growing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles and a trade war with the United States.

In a statement, the Commission insisted the plans were consistent with the EU's 2050 climate targets but take a ""pragmatic"" approach. Moving away from a de-facto ban would allow plug-in hybrids, range extenders and internal combustion engine vehicles to play a role beyond 2035, alongside battery-electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Other ""key flexibilities"" include lowering the 2030 CO2 reduction target for vans to 40 percent from 50 percent, introducing super credits for small, affordable electric cars and setting mandatory national targets for zero- or low-emission corporate fleets. The targets would be tailored to each member state, with national authorities choosing how best to meet them.

German environment minister Carsten Schneider said the proposal gives automakers ""greater leeway to manage the transition to the electric future."" Germany's car industry association VDA criticised the proposal as ""disappointing"" and ""fatal,"" saying it would ""impose new requirements on the auto industry — for example on the use of green steel or renewable fuels."" Such requirements were beyond the industry's control and could leave manufacturers exposed to penalties if expectations were not met, said VDA president Hildegard Müller.

Martin Kaiser, head of Greenpeace Germany, said the EU is gifting Chinese electric carmakers an ""early Christmas present"" and ""sacrificing Europe's climate goals.""

Transport is the EU's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The sector's emissions have fallen only slightly since 2005. The Commission's proposals ""are expected to slow the momentum of Europe's EV market at a time when global car electrification is accelerating,"" the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said in a statement. But it added that proposals on corporate fleet regulations are a silver lining and could help speed up the adoption of zero-emission cars and vans, ""increasing their future availability in the second-hand market.""",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-17 14:59:41.044954

Ford notified LG of the canceled order on Wednesday, the South Korean company said in a regulatory filing in Seoul. The amount is equivalent more than a third of LG’s total revenue last year.

LG is the latest casualty of Ford’s retrenchment in EVs — the carmaker recently said it would take $19.5 billion in charges tied to the business and that it would scrap plans to make an electric F-Series truck. The company is also breaking up its U.S. battery venture with Korea’s SK Innovation Co.

Ford’s announcement this week kicked off a cascade of signals that the EV era is entering a more uncertain, more contested phase. The European Commission backed away from what had been the world’s most aggressive timeline for phasing out internal-combustion engines, granting manufacturers and consumers more time to move off gasoline.

Those who took early resignation but were not eligible to retire were paid until the end of September.

In an email, EPA spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said the “vast majority of those employees on administrative leave” took the deferred resignation option.

“We are doing more with less and remain confident EPA has the resources needed to accomplish the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, fulfill all statutory obligations, and make the best-informed decisions based on the gold standard of science,” Hirsch said. “EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer resources and will be better able to deliver on its core mission of protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback.”

Other EPA employees received reduction-in-force notices and were placed on leave beginning in February because the agency determined their roles no longer aligned with the agency’s goals, including work associated with environmental justice, and diversity, equity and inclusion.

During an event for reporters last week, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency started with more than 16,000 employees at the start of the Trump administration’s return to office and would end with about 12,500 by the end of the year.

But former employees, advocates and attorneys said the leaves and the subsequent terminations could harm the public and environmental health.

Longtime staffers who signed the letter said in interviews that they feared the agency’s long-standing approach to protecting human health and the environment “would be reversed,” according to Ted Yackulic, a former attorney and adviser who litigated for the cleanup of Superfund sites in EPA’s Region 10. Yackulic, who had helped negotiate cleanup for more than 30 high priority polluted sites across 36 years, was nearing a settlement for a waterway that was inundated with heavy metals and hazardous substances in Seattle when he was placed on administrative leave in July for signing the dissent letter.

Yackulic, one of six former employees who have appealed their terminations, said that the loss of several attorneys has meant that “the cleanup of contaminated properties may be significantly delayed.”

But Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who directs the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said that given the Trump administration’s push to boost fossil fuel production and lower energy costs, “some people at EPA are not needed.”",,N,,2025-12-17 15:00:14.724965

Strengthening the Nation’s Clean-Energy Manufacturing

The research team will analyze the economic, employment, environmental, and climate implications of emerging domestic manufacturing hubs and clusters and identify evidence-based strategies to strengthen U.S.’s clean-energy manufacturing.

The project will collaborate with experts from the University of Maryland Center for Global Sustainability, New York Climate Exchange, University of California Berkeley, University of Dayton, and Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, with additional partners for local implementation and policy impact.

Combining empirical analysis, energy-systems modeling, and case studies, the project will evaluate the effectiveness of federal and state manufacturing incentives, examine spatial patterns of clean-energy investments, map supply-chain shifts, estimate impact on clean energy jobs, assess impacts on emissions and climate effects, and organize a stakeholder workshop to gain insights on strengthening domestic clean energy manufacturing.

The project will also create research and training opportunities for Baruch College students through the Deep Energy and Climate Policy Lab.

Interdisciplinary and Cross Institutional Research Team

The research team includes experts in industrial policy, trade economics, energy systems, sustainability, and international supply chains. Each co-PI highlights the project’s unique contributions:

Gang He, Baruch College

“This generous support from the Sloan Foundation enables us to take a rigorous, data-driven look at one of the most consequential industrial transformations underway in the United States. Understanding how domestic clean-energy manufacturing evolves, and who benefits, is essential for designing policies that support workers, communities, and a competitive low-carbon economy.”

Kaifang Luo, Baruch College

“By coupling integrated assessment modeling with supply-chain analysis, we can better understand the technology evolution, cost trajectory, and decarbonization pathways associated with different combinations of industrial policies.”

Michael Davidson, University of California San Diego

“Federal incentives are reshaping the geography of clean-energy manufacturing at a scale we haven’t seen in decades. This project will help identify which policy strategies create durable industrial ecosystems, and which may struggle to take root.”

Ahmad Lashkaripour, Indiana University

“Domestic manufacturing is deeply intertwined with global trade dynamics. By examining how U.S. policies interact with international supply chains, our work will shed light on trade implications that are critical for long-term competitiveness and economic resilience.”

Minghao Qiu, Stony Brook University

“Clean-energy supply chains have profound consequences for environmental sustainability and climate mitigation. Our analysis will quantify how different manufacturing pathways affect emissions, air quality, and broader environmental outcomes, insights that are essential for guiding responsible industrial transformation.”

Ilaria Mazzocco, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)

“Effective industrial strategy requires more than data—it requires dialogue. This project will bring policymakers, industry leaders, and community stakeholders together through workshop and collaborative engagement to ensure that our research directly informs real-world decisions.”

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.","DETROIT — Sixteen states, including Maryland, and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration for what they say is the unlawful withholding of over $2 billion in funding for two electric vehicle charging programs.

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday’s separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Maryland, Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

The author argues that communities can negotiate terms with data center companies to ensure local benefits and responsible development.

Modern data centers are being built with cleaner, more efficient technology, including renewable energy and closed-loop cooling systems.

Building this digital infrastructure is seen as vital for keeping Wisconsin's economy competitive with other states.

(Editor's Note: This column was updated for minor editing to add clarity.)

Charlie Berens has a real gift for capturing what people love about this state. As someone who is a voice for the unions that represent nearly 50,000 skilled tradespeople across Wisconsin, I value those who share what an amazing place we live and work in.

That’s why I paid attention when he engaged on data centers. He has made a career out of bringing to life the Wisconsin working guy we all know and love - flannel shirt, Kwik Trip runs, and all. Well, those same folks he channels? They're the ones building these facilities. I was disappointed to see data centers painted as a threat to Wisconsin.

We don’t see it that way. These projects support our members’ lives, and those who do this work every day experience the story differently from what’s gaining traction online. The digital future our world is moving toward is tied to this infrastructure, and it can be a powerful catalyst for community growth when done right.

Doing Wisconsin data centers right is what matters

Done right. That part matters. Communities have the power to negotiate the terms of these projects. It is not a situation where we have no say. Local leaders can require community benefits that make a real difference for decades. That might be infrastructure upgrades that utilize renewable resources, support for schools, investments in roads, or a tax agreement that takes pressure off homeowners. We must set expectations early, and hold companies to them.

Here’s the thing: for us in the building trades, data centers aren’t some big, scary mystery. They’re high-skill, long-term work. The kind of work that feeds families, pays mortgages, and sends kids to college. They’re complex builds that require skilled blue-collar workers, such as electricians, ironworkers, and operators.

This is the work that builds the middle class. It sustains local construction workforces for years, and gives our apprentices the chance to learn cutting-edge skills that translate to our factories, hospitals, and utilities. It also means continued maintenance work and high-tech jobs when construction ends. When people talk about jobs that allow families to stay in the communities they grew up in, this is the sort of project they are talking about.

Misinformation plagues environmental impact of data centers

There is also significant misinformation about the environmental impact of data centers. A few years ago, the concerns Berens highlights were major considerations. The technology is constantly evolving, and these facilities now operate cleaner and more efficiently than many other projects currently under construction. For example, one recently proposed Wisconsin data center would be powered by 750 mW of new renewable energy generation with a closed-loop cooling design that would not impact local water supply.

Our tradespeople fish the same lakes and hunt in the same woods we all do, they would not support something that threatens those places. We live here, too.

These projects also keep Wisconsin competitive. If we want our small businesses, schools, clinics, and communities to thrive, we need reliable digital infrastructure, attracting future-focused skill sets. Other states are competing aggressively for this investment. While we shouldn’t accept those investments lightly, we should weigh the fact that they can pay dividends for decades if we negotiate strong agreements and insist on responsible development.

Our members love Packers Sundays, Friday fish fries, and a good old-fashioned. We're bumping into each other at Fleet Farm on Saturday mornings. But we also need good jobs and strong communities. We hope Charlie will listen to some of us who see opportunity, not catastrophe, in building the infrastructure that supports the next generation of work.

Bloomington Energy Works funds energy usage audits and outreach efforts as part of a national program to build the market for clean energy projects like solar systems or electric vehicles that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

Shawn Miya, assistant director of sustainability at Bloomington’s Economic and Sustainable Development Department, said the program will help the community save on energy bills while pushing Bloomington toward its Climate Action Plan goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% below 2018 emission levels by 2030.

For the first stage of the program, Bloomington Energy Works hired energy development company Donovan Energy, which provides consulting services for businesses interested in reducing their carbon output and energy bills.

Developers and large building owners who apply and are selected can receive free technical assistance, which could include an analysis on 12 months of energy usage data or an on-site visit to determine the best path to improving the building’s energy usage.

Donovan Energy could also provide recommendations for specific clean energy projects or a financial analysis of potential solutions, including information on possible cost-saving measures like tax credits or incentives.

The possible solutions include measures like solar energy systems, optimized temperature controls, LED lighting and electric vehicle charging stations.

To inform homeowners and residents on clean energy solutions, Bloomington Energy Works hired local green energy nonprofit Electrify Indiana to spearhead community involvement and outreach.

Electrify Indiana is seeking adults and high schoolers to serve as “Energy Navigators,” who will give educational presentations or go door to door informing residents on solutions for energy efficiency and financial incentives or cost-saving measures for implementing the solutions.

It is also looking for homeowners who have implemented electric energy solutions like induction stoves, heat pumps or solar panels to host a show-and-tell displaying the technology.

Building owners or homeowners in or near Bloomington can learn more on the Bloomington Energy Works website, or watch its launch webinar for detailed information.

The City of Bloomington launched the program in partnership with the Indiana Energy Independence Fund, a nonprofit “green bank,” or financial institution that facilitates investment in green energy projects.

IEIF paid for the project with a $250,000 Municipal Investment Fund grant, a funding opportunity designed by the Coalition for Green Capital, a national nonprofit green bank. ICLEI USA, a national chapter of a global network for sustainable urban development, awarded the funding to the IEIF with the intention of using it for Bloomington’s program.

Through the MIF program, about 49 local and tribal governments and nonprofits have received $250,000 each to help create a list of potential public-private partnership plans.

By April 15, Miya said Bloomington Energy Works plans to create and submit a public-private partnership plan for the second phase of the MIF program, which will select 10 of the original grantees for an additional $2 million in funding to further develop the project plans.

The Coalition for Green Capital is partly funded with money from the National Clean Investment Fund, a program of the Inflation Reduction Act. Earlier this year, the Trump administration froze billions of dollars of that funding.

In response, CGC filed a lawsuit against Citibank, the bank holding the grant money.

CGC plans to build the funds for the next phase of the MIF grant through “philanthropic and private resources,” according to a statement from ICLEI USA in July.

Miya said the outlook of what money Bloomington and other cities would get is uncertain.

“Everything is potential at this point,” Miya said.

IEIF Executive Director Alex Crowley said Bloomington Energy Works plans to do its best with its current funding.

""This is a great beginning, or down payment grant. We will optimize that, and then let's set ourselves up to compete for whatever's available,” Crowley said.

If the next phase of the grant is able to be funded, Crowley said Bloomington Energy Works could be positioned to stand out against other applications.

Indiana lacks tools like Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy, a system for financing clean energy projects available in other parts of the country, and many Indiana counties ban solar energy installations.

The EPA estimates that 80 percent of wetlands in the U.S. would fall outside the definition of “Waters of the United States” and thus would not be under federal protection under the new rule.
“Our developments take multiple years to plan, build, and this proposed definition will finally give us a consistent set of rules that will provide much needed predictability,” he said.
Environmental groups say the rule would jeopardize protections for wetlands that protect water quality in rivers and streams and public drinking water systems.
If we are not protecting our wetlands and headwater streams to suck up that stormwater, downstream communities bear the consequence,” he said.","This week, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency heard testimony in Pittsburgh from environmental groups, scientists and industry representatives about proposed changes to the enforcement of the Clean Water Act.

The Trump administration says the new rules are needed to comply with a recent Supreme Court ruling in the 2023 Sackett decision, which said wetlands receiving federal protection must have a “continuous surface connection” to a river, stream or other waterway.

The EPA estimates that 80 percent of wetlands in the U.S. would fall outside the definition of “Waters of the United States” and thus would not be under federal protection under the new rule. Some would still be protected by state laws, as would be the case in Pennsylvania.

Wes Brooks, deputy assistant administrator in EPA’s Office of Water, said at the hearing that the current rules created under the Biden Administration did not abide by the Sackett decision. The new rules, Brooks said, would make it easier for businesses to operate.

“Under the proposed rule, small, isolated [water] features that lack a surface water connection to adjacent rivers, streams, lakes, or oceans do not satisfy [the Supreme Court’s] conditions to warrant federal oversight, and therefore would fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of states and tribes to manage and conserve as they see fit,” said Brooks.

The new rules are favored by developers, ranchers, farmers and those in other industries.

Glenn Stoltzfus of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau operates a 700-cow dairy farm in Somerset County. He testified that current rules make it hard for farmers like him to operate.

“Many of these farms operate close to streams and wetlands. These changes would significantly reduce regulatory burden and provide greater operational flexibility,” Stoltzfus said.

He said that complying with current regulations to do things like maintaining drainage ditches, installing irrigation systems and maintaining farm ponds is difficult.

”The cost of hiring consultants to determine whether or not you are in compliance when trying to expand your operation sometimes can be astronomical,” he said.

The panel also heard from industries like road construction and home building.

Hans Klinger of the Home Builders Association of Virginia said the new definition would make it easier for builders to know which areas require a federal clean water permit.

“Our developments take multiple years to plan, build, and this proposed definition will finally give us a consistent set of rules that will provide much needed predictability,” he said.

Environmental groups say the rule would jeopardize protections for wetlands that protect water quality in rivers and streams and public drinking water systems.

Patrick Shirey, an assistant professor of geology and environmental science at the University of Pittsburgh, says reducing wetland protection in an age of climate change will hurt water quality.

“Storms are getting heavier, more frequent, and more devastating. If we are not protecting our wetlands and headwater streams to suck up that stormwater, downstream communities bear the consequence,” he said.

“In the long run, when we realize the degradation of our nation’s waters from dredging and filling wetlands…the consequence is to the future generations” to pay for, he said.

Eric Harder, the Youghiogheny Riverkeeper at the Mountain Watershed Association, called the rule change a “handout” to industry because it would allow developers to more easily build in areas that had been previously considered wetlands.

“This is just another tool for them to use to make it easier to build their proposal or operation and really limit the amount of public…interaction that can be done.”",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/47909150741_cb55893f9d_k.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:00:30.605552

From Westlands Water District

Today, the Westlands Water District Board of Directors voted to certify the Final Program Environmental Impact Report (FPEIR) and adopt Findings of Fact under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the Valley Clean Infrastructure Plan (VCIP). This action underscores Westlands’ leadership in charting a path forward for District growers and rural communities grappling with the impacts of widespread land fallowing driven by inadequate and unreliable water supplies and the ongoing implementation of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA).

This year alone, chronic water shortages have forced more than 215,000 acres—roughly 38% of the District’s irrigable farmland—out of production, with additional acreage expected to be fallowed as SGMA further constrains groundwater use. These reductions jeopardize the thousands of jobs supported by the District and threaten the economic stability of rural communities whose essential services depend on the revenues generated by active agricultural production.

The VCIP offers a responsible, forward-looking land-use strategy that helps preserve the long-term viability of agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley. The plan repurposes up to 136,000 acres of drainage-impaired and water supply-limited lands for solar generation, energy storage, and transmission infrastructure, using previously cultivated acreage to support clean energy development while reducing pressure to build on undisturbed lands. In doing so, VCIP supports SGMA implementation and helps protect critical infrastructure from subsidence. The VCIP provides landowners with new, stable revenue streams through long-term leases, and allows growers to concentrate limited water supplies on their most productive and resilient acreage.

At full buildout, VCIP could generate up to 21 gigawatts of renewable energy, create thousands of construction and long-term jobs, and help California meet its statewide renewable energy goals. Through implementation of the board-affirmed community benefits commitment, local communities will directly share in the economic and social advantages of the clean-energy transition.

“Inadequate and unpredictable water supplies, made worse by SGMA’s demands, have forced more than 215,000 acres out of production this year alone, with real consequences for hardworking family farmers, workers and rural communities,” said Allison Febbo, General Manager of Westlands Water District. “Westlands is leading in finding solutions that protect the future of farming in the District and provide landowners with viable alternatives when water simply isn’t available. VCIP does exactly that. It strengthens the District’s agricultural resilience by giving fallowed acreage a new purpose, generating stable revenue streams for landowners, and helping preserve family farms for the next generation.”

Next Steps

Adoption of VCIP establishes a long-term blueprint for developing clean-energy facilities and supporting transmission infrastructure on repurposed lands that can no longer sustain irrigated agriculture. Certification of the FPEIR and adoption of VCIP allow the District and its partners to begin advancing project-level planning, permitting, and implementation steps.

Implementation of VCIP is supported by new authorities granted under AB 2661 (Soria 2024), which allow the District to develop, construct, and own solar generation, battery storage, and transmission facilities identified in the plan and require the District to adopt a community benefits plan. The District will also evaluate placing these facilities under the operational control of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). Westlands will continue working with stakeholders on environmental compliance, land-use coordination, and phased development activities consistent with the adopted plan.",https://mavensnotebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Solar-panels-pixabay.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:03:50.987990

Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.","Ford is scrapping plans to make fully electric full-sized pickups.

Ford will take a roughly $20 billion hit, but the company expects the recalibration of its electric vehicle strategy to prove more profitable in the long run.

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said the “customer-driven shift” will strengthen the company.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business,” Farley said in an announcement Monday.

Kelley Blue Book automotive expert Sean Tucker said the cancellation of the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup headlines the changes announced by Ford.

“They're cancelling a number of large EVs that they had planned, but they're not abandoning the EV market,” Tucker said.

Ford said it still expects about half of its global inventory will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030, up from 17% this year.

And the company has big plans for its universal EV platform, which will be used to roll out lower-priced, smaller cars and trucks, beginning with a midsize pickup in 2027.

Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV uses gas power to recharge the EV battery, but the gas doesn't directly power the vehicle's movement.

The engine is effectively a generator, not actually attached to the drivetrain in any way, Tucker said.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.

“All trucks lose about half the range when they tow, regardless of what their fuel source is,” Tucker said. “But that's a much bigger deal when stopping to recharge takes hours than it is when stopping to fill a tank takes two minutes.”

Plus, big trucks are most popular in the parts of the country where EV infrastructure is poor, Tucker said.

Ford said the next-generation extended-range EV, or EREV, F-150 Lightning will add an estimated 700-plus mile range and tow “like a locomotive.”

Tucker said Ford made the right call.

“It was an understandable decision in 2021 to say, ‘Our bestselling product is the F-150. Why don’t we just electrify our bestselling product first?’ But the market for electric full-size trucks is just, it hasn't really emerged,” Tucker said. “And I think that the EREV is probably a more realistic technology, that the sort of person who's interested in a full-size truck might listen to that more than they would to a pure EV.”

RELATED STORY: Trump tries to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements

Tucker said KBB estimates that dealers have about a 147-day supply of fully electric F-150 Lightning trucks, so folks who want to buy one still have time.

Tucker said American automakers have a tough time balancing domestic and international markets, with about a quarter of the overseas market already electric. Stateside, it’s just 7% or so, Tucker said.

That creates a two-tiered, expensive production strategy, one for the North American market and one for the rest of the world.

Tucker said the U.S. market is still moving toward EVs, but it’s moving more slowly than initial projections.

And Tucker said Ford’s decisions have more to do with market demands than politics, with President Donald Trump trying to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements.

“Politicians want a lot of headlines talking about the automotive industry, but the automotive industry does not move at the speed of politics,” Tucker said. “If you sit down to design a new car today, it's going to roll out to the public in about five to seven years. It's a long design cycle. So, I don't think they're making a lot of quick decisions based on something the president did last month.”",https://bakersfieldnow.com/resources/media2/16x9/8380/1320/47x575/90/443d8481-4e5a-4d33-97ee-293b7f730794-GettyImages2252102754.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:01:31.234235

AUSTIN – Here’s what the Texas Transportation Commission discussed and approved at its December meeting.

Year at a glance

Acting Commission Chair Alvin New presented a recap of notable accomplishments and events the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) saw in 2025.

When devastating flooding impacted Central Texas in July, 869 TxDOT employees from across the state responded to repair and reopen roads, clear debris and inspect bridges. In the Austin area, Cow Creek bridge was rebuilt just 29 days after being swept away.

Crews responded to other severe weather events across the state, including winter weather and dust storms in North Texas. TxDOT employees also responded to numerous dangerous situations while out in the field, helping save citizens from flooded roads and vehicle fires.

TxDOT celebrated the opening of the new Harbor Bridge in Corpus Christi in June. The $1.3 billion project is the longest concrete segmental cable-stayed bridge in North America.

The 89th Legislative Session brought new legislation that enhances TxDOT’s ability to recruit and maintain employees, as well as support for aviation, rail and maritime infrastructure.

TxDOT received a renewal in its participation in the Federal Highway Association’s National Environmental Policy Act assignment program.

TxDOT continued to set records in construction. The department currently has more than $60 billion in active construction projects.

Construction milestones included the groundbreaking of the Spur 399 widening, I-27 and I-69 unveilings, new bridges in the Atlanta area and the demolition of old bridges.

The Paris District opened its new district headquarters building.

TxDOT used a robotic dog for mapping, including the surveying of a cave in the Austin area. In San Antonio, another cave was preserved to protect endangered cave species. And an archaeological excavation in Lubbock uncovered prehistoric animal bones.

HERO (Highway Emergency Response Operator) launched a program in the Odessa area.

Adopt a Highway celebrated 40 years.

Texas Clear Lanes congestion relief initiative celebrated 10 years of progress.

12 Days of Safety Blitzen

This year, Texas is currently on track to have the lowest number of roadway deaths in more than five years, showing a promising downward trend – even compared to national levels.

TxDOT wants drivers to keep this downward trend going by making safe driving decisions this holiday season, ensuring everyone can have a happy holiday season with loved ones. TxDOT is sharing safe driving messages on digital highway signs and “12 Days of Safety” messaging on social media during December.

Senior leadership

TxDOT appointed two new senior leaders. Saul Romero is the new Odessa District Engineer, and Katie Martin is the new Atlanta District Engineer.

Employee recognition

Two TxDOT employees were honored at the 2025 American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials annual meeting.

Construction Engineer Ray Buzalsky was awarded the Thomas H. MacDonald Memorial Award for five decades of service, and Transportation Engineer Amanda Austin was awarded the President’s Transportation Award for her work on Roundabout and Alternative Intersection Design.

Aviation

The Commission awarded $18.7 million in state and federal grant funding for capital improvement projects at 10 airports.

Contracts

The commissioners awarded low-bid value amounts of $589 million for 61 highway improvement projects and $31 million for 22 routine maintenance projects.

Utility relocation

The Commission approved the state payment of utility relocation on SH 185 in Victoria County at the cost of $932,000.",https://www.txdot.gov/content/dam/images/icons/TxDOT-favicon-large.svg,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:33.896776

Prefabricated stations deployed in 2025 can charge up to 14 vehicles simultaneously, depending on the site, and exclusively feature high-power 350kW fast chargers.","EVgo, one of the largest providers of public fast charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the U.S., has deployed more than 40% of its stations this year by leveraging domestically manufactured prefabricated modular skids.

EVgo exceeded its goal before year-end, driven by a high rate of new station commissionings early in the fourth quarter. The Company’s partnership with Miller Electric Company (“Miller Electric”), a leading electrical contractor based in Jacksonville, Florida, with expertise in complex electrical systems, has led to accelerated station installation timelines and a decrease in station installation costs by an average of 15%.

Prefabrication ensures consistent, high-quality assembly in a controlled environment by assembling all charging equipment onto a single base frame made from American steel and aluminum at Miller Electric’s facility before shipment to the installation site. Since the partnership first launched in 2023, EVgo’s expanded work with Miller Electric has supported local job creation. Miller Electric has scaled capacity at its prefabrication facility and employs more than 1,400 people in the Jacksonville area.

“The prefabrication model is a win-win for EVgo because we can fast-track infrastructure deployment to meet charging demand and support workforce development in this growing industry,” said Dennis Kish, President of EVgo. “Utilizing prefabricated modular skids from Miller Electric is key to scaling EVgo’s nationwide network.”

“By prefabricating EV skids, we’re able to deliver consistent, high-quality installations while reducing timelines and costs. This approach accelerates infrastructure deployment and supports domestic manufacturing and job creation—key pillars for a sustainable future. This collaboration with EVgo demonstrates innovation and efficiency in the EV charging industry,” said Pat Eliason, Group President at Miller Electric.

In addition to cost and time efficiencies, prefabrication can seamlessly integrate features that enhance customer experience such as Wi-Fi infrastructure, lighting, security cameras, and canopies.

Despite near-term year-over-year declines in the utility-scale and residential segments, the report projects 92.9 GW of storage will be installed in the U.S. over the next five years.
Residential storage is expected to deliver a record-breaking Q4 this year “driven by demand pull-in due to the expiration of the Section 25D [investment tax credit],” the report said.
“In 2026, the residential market is expected to contract 6% and will transition toward third-party ownership models, which accounted for 57% of the residential storage market in Q3 2025.” Keep up with the story.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

2025 is set to be another record-breaking year for energy storage after the U.S. installed 12.9 GW in the first three quarters, surpassing 2024’s total installed capacity of 12.3 GW, according to a Tuesday report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.

At the same time, prices for utility-scale battery systems have dropped 11% year-over-year, from $1,050/kW to $938/kW, the report found.

“Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, in a release. “Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”

2025 is on track to increase new capacity installments by 54% over last year, the report said. However, the market is still adapting to supply chain constraints that have emerged as the result of tariffs and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s new foreign entity of concern rules for claiming Inflation Reduction Act credits.

The OBBBA largely spared energy storage from the harshest cuts it made to the IRA’s clean energy tax credits. The report noted that its utility-scale five-year storage forecast “has increased 15% compared to pre-[OBBBA] projections, while the [community-scale, commercial and industrial] segment is projected to grow 23% from 2025 to 2029.”

Wood Mackenzie projects a 10% contraction in 2026 across all segments and another drop in 2027 before the storage sector rebounds with double-digit year-over-year growth projected for 2028 and 2029 as domestic manufacturing capacity comes online.

“The market is positioned for strong recovery,” it said.

Despite near-term year-over-year declines in the utility-scale and residential segments, the report projects 92.9 GW of storage will be installed in the U.S. over the next five years.

Residential storage is expected to deliver a record-breaking Q4 this year “driven by demand pull-in due to the expiration of the Section 25D [investment tax credit],” the report said. “In 2026, the residential market is expected to contract 6% and will transition toward third-party ownership models, which accounted for 57% of the residential storage market in Q3 2025.”

Dana Nessel has filed an opinion in the case before the Michigan Public Service Commission. Consumers have asked for a 10% hike on gas customers.

Big picture view:

Consumers Energy is looking for a $240 million increase in its gas rates, which would come out to approximately an 8% increase for residential customers.

The MPSC approved a previous hike from Consumers three months earlier, authorizing a $157.5 million increase in rates.

This is the fourth year in a row that the utility has asked for an increase.

Consumers Energy sells gas to 1.8 million households in Michigan, including in Southeast Michigan.

The original filing is available here.

What they're saying:

Nessel said the public service commission has repeatedly authorized reduced increases compared to what Consumers has asked for.

""Consumers Energy has consistently filed these rate hike requests filled with unjustifiable costs, and my office has consistently intervened to ensure any unfair or indefensible costs are not foisted onto its customers,"" she said. ""This happens over and over again and amounts to millions of dollars. My office will once again thoroughly review this latest request, which – based on nearly every past experience with Consumers Energy – will undoubtedly contain many of the same unjustified and overstated costs we’ve seen time and again from its incessant rate hike requests.""

The other side:

Consumers Energy says it will ""stand by our natural gas rate request.""

Spokesperson Megan Kirk with Consumers Energy released a statement saying:

""(We) will demonstrate to the Public Service Commission that our proposals are needed to continue heating homes and businesses safely, reliably and affordably. Our customers’ rates today are below the state, Midwest and national average, and we will continue to work actively to squeeze every dollar out of our system for the well-being of our customers.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox2detroit.com/www.fox2detroit.com/content/uploads/2023/08/1280/720/GettyImages-1239647204.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:17.103135

Dive Brief:

The Environmental Protection Agency last week launched a webpage to provide local communities and data center developers with “a central location for Clean Air Act (CAA)-related resources,” including regulatory information, guidance and technical tools designed to accelerate the ability to build data centers and the backup power generation they require, according to a press release.

Also last week, a coalition of more than 230 national, state and local organizations sent a letter to Congress calling for a nationwide moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, saying their rapid expansion “presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.”

“We are seeing how difficult it is to move any policies forward at the federal level,” Jim Walsh, policy director for Food and Water Watch, told Smart Cities Dive. “In the near term, it’s more likely that states, counties or municipal governments would enact moratoriums until there are standards in place to actually address the litany of concerns about data centers.”

Dive Insight:

Tech companies are investing billions of dollars to build data centers to train and run AI platforms.

President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order forbidding state AI laws that conflict with his administration’s AI-forward policies and threatening to restrict federal funding if their laws are found to be burdensome. That order follows one Trump signed in January calling for a national AI action plan “to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in July that the EPA was “committed to increasing certainty in the permitting process that is crucial to securing power demand for data centers” and partnering with state, local, and tribal air-quality agencies to promote “ways for Americans to invest and develop AI domestically.”

EPA is updating Clean Air Act rules requiring companies to “maintain proper pollution control” that it says “have not been updated to reflect technological advancements of the 21st century,” according to last week’s press release.

“EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback,” Zeldin said in a statementannouncing the new website. The website furthers two core pillars of that initiative: making the U.S. the AI capital of the world and “advancing cooperative federalism,” according to the press release.

In their letter to Congress, the environmental organizations stated that tripling the number of data centers in the next five years would require as much electricity as about 30 million households, as much water as about 18.5 million households and contribute to escalating electricity costs.

Bloomberg reported in September that wholesale power costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers.

U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced Thursday that they are opening an investigation into “alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as AI data centers’ energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities.”

“City leaders are faced with significant challenges when data centers decide to locate in their communities, because the data centers themselves are so resource-intensive, both in terms of energy and water usage, it can be challenging for a municipality to actually evaluate and understand the full impacts of what permitting that data center in their community might be,” Walsh said.

Walsh said Trump’s executive order “doesn’t do anything to prevent local communities from exercising their existing powers” to enact moratoriums on building new data centers in their jurisdictions.

Local governments are beginning to push back.

Latin America is at a pivotal moment, when strategic actions can significantly reshape its economic future.","The world is entering a new era characterized by significant changes. The global order is in the midst of shifting from a unipolar to a multipolar structure, with recent developments in trade policies reshaping global dynamics. The green transition is spurring increased demand for key commodities and final goods, while the expanding middle class and global population growth are putting pressure on land use systems and raising concerns about food security. In addition, the rapid advancement of new technological platforms is transforming production and the competitive landscape across industries.

These global trends present challenges and opportunities for all countries. But Latin America’s competitive strengths make the region particularly well positioned to meet the moment. Its abundant and cost-competitive renewable energy and talented workforce could enable Latin America to benefit from an ever more digital and compute-intensive global economy. Further, its rich, diverse natural resources put the region at an advantage amid rising demand for food, energy, and critical minerals. Meanwhile, its production capabilities, geographic location, and relatively neutral geopolitical stance could offer its advanced-manufacturing sector a competitive edge.

Of course, we recognize that Latin America is made up of a diverse mix of economies, peoples, and histories. Indeed, the notion of “Latin America” as a single entity may resonate more outside the region than within it. Nevertheless, our research grapples with the idea that Latin America has been a land of unrealized potential for more than 50 years. As we see it, the current global shifts present a once-in-a-generation chance to change course. The region’s investment levels and productivity output have struggled to keep pace in a rapidly shifting global economy, and the expansion of its labor force is losing steam. Moreover, about 60 percent of the population today lives below the empowerment line, and it faces the prospect of “getting old before getting rich” due to demographic pressures and a weak growth outlook.

If GDP growth per capita persists at recent rates, it will rise only 19 percent by 2040—just one-third of emerging Asia’s growth over the same period. Therefore, growth will be critical to enable more households to meet their basic needs and start to save. This report explores pathways Latin America can take to jump-start productivity and enable its population to reach high-income status.

Increasing Latin America’s productivity and closing investment gaps

Increased investment and more effective capital allocation are essential to achieve higher productivity growth in Latin America and unlock the region’s full potential. Historically, low investment has hindered productivity in the region. Over the past 25 years, additional capital per worker boosted the region’s productivity growth by just 0.9 percentage points a year, half that of its peers.

From 1997 to 2022, productivity accounted for 35 percent of Latin America’s GDP growth (0.8 percentage points of the total 2.3 percentage points of growth), reflecting the region’s persistent underinvestment in capital-deepening sectors. This is significantly lower than the contribution seen in comparable countries, which achieved at least double or triple Latin America’s rate. For example, Poland and Türkiye achieved 3.5 and 3.0 percentage points, respectively.

If Latin America had matched the productivity growth of its peers such as Egypt, Poland, and Türkiye over this period, its GDP in 2023 would have been 60 to 110 percent higher and the region could have reached high-income status, on average (Exhibit 1).

Weak local investment is a primary contributor to slow productivity growth. In Latin America, gross fixed capital formation, a metric for total investment in an economy’s stock of assets, is approximately 20 percent of GDP, on average, trailing comparable regions (Emerging Asia and Central and Eastern Europe) and countries such as Türkiye and Malaysia. From 1997 to 2019, Latin America’s capital stock per worker grew by only 30 percent, while countries such as Poland and Türkiye experienced a twofold jump in this metric and achieved productivity growth rates two to three times higher than that of Latin America.

A high-income scenario by 2040 would require accelerating productivity growth to match the rate of faster-growing peers

What would Latin America’s productivity look like in the coming years with higher growth? We conducted an analysis of 14 comparable economies that produced two scenarios (see sidebar, “About the productivity growth methodology”). The high-case scenario represents the median of the yearly average productivity growth of these 14 countries during the past two decades, while the low-case scenario represents the average of the lowest quartile.

If Latin America’s productivity growth matched the low- and high-case scenarios of these reference economies, it would achieve a jump of 1.1 and 2.0 percentage points, respectively, beyond the region’s yearly average productivity growth of 0.6 percentage points over the past 20 years. An annual average productivity growth rate of 1.7 to 2.6 percent would enable Latin America to reach a GDP range of $8.9 trillion to $10.3 trillion (in 2023 dollars) by 2040.

Growth of 2.6 percent annually could be achievable for Latin America, given that half the countries in the sample exceeded this level. Although a jump in productivity growth from 0.8 percent to 2.6 percent might seem ambitious, more than a third of the countries we analyzed have recorded even larger increases over the past two decades. This precedent suggests that with the right strategies, Latin America could achieve these growth rates, paving the way for significant economic expansion.

Average annual investment of $1.9 trillion to $2.3 trillion through 2040 could enable Latin America’s GDP growth

The growth of middle-income economies depends on sufficient levels of investment, among other variables. Based on the correlation between capital per worker and productivity as countries develop economically, achieving a GDP of $8.9 trillion to $10.3 trillion in Latin America by 2040 would likely require average annual total investment in the range of $1.9 trillion to $2.3 trillion.

Assuming the region’s GDP reaches the high-case scenario of $10.3 trillion, this ramp-up of investment could reach approximately 28 percent of GDP by 2040, up from 20 percent today and aligned with other fast-growing regions such as China (around 40 percent), Türkiye (31 percent), and India (30 percent) over the past 20 years.

Unlocking Latin America’s growth potential amid global shifts

Four trends, from changing global power dynamics and technological advancements to demographic transitions and evolving resource and energy systems, are influencing the course of the global economy. Together, they could usher in a new era of economic opportunity, but they also bring specific challenges.

Multipolar world

The global order is shifting from a unipolar to a multipolar structure. Global integration still shapes trade, migration, capital flows, and intangibles (such as knowledge transfer), but underlying trends are evolving. Recently, trade has been reconfiguring along geopolitical lines. Since 2017, the average geopolitical distance of goods trade has fallen by 4 to 10 percent for economies such as China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Meanwhile, economies such as Brazil and India have achieved high trading volumes across the geopolitical spectrum. As countries seek to mitigate risks, supply chains could become more regionally concentrated or aligned with countries with similar geopolitical goals.

Although this trend poses economic challenges, it also creates opportunities. Regions or countries with strategic geographic locations, neutral geopolitical stances, or significant reserves of resources (such as those critical to the energy transition) could strengthen their position in new supply chains and address emerging demand.

Technological advancements

Rapid technological advances, particularly in AI, cloud computing, and digital services, could open a $100 billion export opportunity for Latin America in knowledge-based services. To convey the magnitude of the opportunity, total global revenues for AI software and services and cloud could rise to as much as $8 trillion by 2040. Together, they could be two of the most dynamic and mutually reinforcing arenas of growth in the decades ahead, with multitrillion-dollar revenue opportunities and significant productivity impact on the rest of the economy.

This growth is fueling demand for IT services, business process outsourcing (BPO), and digital infrastructure. Global data center IT load, for example, is projected to quadruple from 55 gigawatts (GW) in 2023 to 219 GW by 2030, creating an opportunity for certain regions to both supply services and cover the infrastructure gap.

Demographic transitions

The world is undergoing a profound demographic transformation. Fertility rates are declining, leading to aging populations in many regions. This trend increases pressure on healthcare and social security systems and could result in labor shortages, widening regional inequalities, and the erosion of intergenerational wealth. Further, the world’s rural population reached a peak in 2020 and has since started to shrink. This urban expansion will predominantly occur outside the Western world.

As these developments raise new challenges around the world, they also bring evolving consumption patterns that could create new opportunities. Overall population growth, rising incomes, and urbanization will increase demand for manufactured goods, energy, and food. Indeed, global demand for food is projected to rise more than 40 percent by 2040, which will create an opening for producers across sectors.

Resource and energy systems

The global shift toward cleaner energy sources is underway, guided by ambitions to reach net-zero emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuel. Yet this transition is complex and requires a balance among energy security, affordability, industrial competitiveness, and decarbonization. On the supply side, geopolitical shifts have further exposed vulnerabilities in energy and materials supply chains. On the demand side, the transition could increase the need for products and intermediate goods.

Despite record volume in renewable and electrification investments, project deployment remains below the level required to meet 2030 and 2050 targets set by countries and companies in line with the Paris Agreement. In Europe and the United States, for instance, less than 20 percent of announced solar capacity and 15 percent of hydrogen projects have reached the final investment decision stage, creating a high risk of cancellation or delay. This persistent gap means oil and gas could remain a central part of the energy mix beyond 2050 (even under accelerated transition scenarios).

Latin America is well positioned to respond to global trends

The four global trends will alter demand across sectors. While Latin America’s distinctive strengths and assets could offer new sources of growth and competitiveness, it would need to develop new capabilities and unlock more potential from existing ones. Focusing investment on sectors and countries where capabilities and new sources of demand could align offers a microlevel strategy for beginning to advance the region’s possibilities. Where such investments succeed, the possibilities for broader-based growth across companies and sectors expand.

Our research examined the region’s sectors and identified three themes with the greatest potential to help the region attract investment and enhance economic growth: revitalizing Latin America’s industrial base, thriving in the age of global digitalization, and leveraging Latin America’s natural endowments.

Revitalizing Latin America’s industrial base. The changing global order presents Latin America with an opportunity to capitalize on the ongoing restructuring of global supply chains, especially for export-oriented industries such as manufacturing.

The region’s location, particularly its proximity to the North American market, offers a significant advantage in global trade. Its shipping times are roughly half those of Asia, enabling faster delivery, reducing logistics costs, and enhancing supply chain responsiveness. Further, at a time of shifting global supply chains and trade realignments, Latin America’s relative proximity to global extremes on the geopolitical spectrum could enable the region to deepen trade ties across diverse blocs, expanding exports to other countries and extending trade partnerships. In addition, Latin America’s manufacturing sectors are well placed to take advantage of the global energy transition. The region is home to some of the world’s most abundant and competitive renewable energy resources, including hydro, wind, and solar power.

By harnessing these endowments and building on existing industrial capabilities, Latin America has the potential to emerge as a key energy carrier for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Capturing this potential will require accelerating technology adoption, building know-how, strengthening supply chain integration, and deepening international openness.

Thriving in the age of global digitalization. The rapid acceleration of digital technologies is increasing global demand for digital services. Latin America is well positioned to capture this opportunity: Its advantages include strong knowledge from leading IT companies along with competitive labor costs, solid English proficiency, and highly competitive internet speeds.

Further, the region’s connectivity, competitive operating costs, and abundant renewable energy resources make it an excellent location for energy-intensive data center development. These advantages could allow Latin America to offer a sustainable and cost-effective solution to meet the rising global need for digital infrastructure. Achieving this goal will require closing gaps in digital access and infrastructure and strengthening technical training. Given that digital services and data centers are high-productivity sectors, capitalizing on these opportunities will enhance their contribution to Latin America’s economy, thereby boosting the region’s overall productivity.

Leveraging Latin America’s natural endowments. The global energy transition and AI race are driving a surge in demand for critical minerals, which are essential for renewable energy technologies and battery production. Latin America holds a significant share of the world’s reserves of materials such as lithium and copper. In addition, the region’s central geopolitical positioning could enable it to be seen as a reliable source of minerals for different trade partners.

Shifting demographics are projected to increase global food demand by more than 40 percent by 2040, presenting another opportunity for Latin America, which has 14 percent of the world’s arable land. Most Latin American and Caribbean countries could double agricultural productivity by modernizing just 25 percent of small farms with improved input application and cultivation practices. Capturing agriculture’s potential will require Latin American growers to embrace more-productive practices (such as farm equipment and automation) and reallocate resources from less- to more-productive subsectors (for example, fruits and industrial crops). Lifting labor productivity in agriculture would increase incomes for farmers while reducing overall employment share, with workers moving to higher-productivity jobs in other sectors.

These themes could add $1.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion to Latin America’s GDP by 2040

While the region has distinctive competitive advantages in each of these three themes, it still needs to address critical gaps, from human capital development, infrastructure enhancement, and macroeconomic stability to the creation of new trade corridors and expansion of current ones. Moreover, attracting investment will require coordinated action from both the public and private sectors. Nonetheless, sectors and companies are primed to build on the region’s advantages.

To understand a plausible growth scenario for Latin America, we divided the economy into two parts: sectors associated with the three themes, which currently account for 29 percent of the region’s GDP, and the rest of the economy. One potential path is for the three themes to increase by 3.0 to 5.0 percent annually, the range of productivity growth levels of benchmark countries in comparable sectors, while the rest of the economy grows 1.1 to 1.3 percent a year, a level in line with the lower-end performance of comparable economies. This rate of growth would generate an additional $1.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion to regional GDP above the current trajectory by 2040 (Exhibit 2).

This two-speed option is just one of many the region could follow to exceed $10 trillion in GDP by 2040, but it offers high-level validation of how building on strengths in certain areas could address the productivity imperative.

Seven sectors for transformative investment

The three strategic themes encompass a multitude of growth opportunities for Latin America. The region has an opportunity to transform its productivity through investments in seven high-potential sectors that exemplify the impact these themes could have on the region:

Revitalizing the industrial base.This includes next-gen manufacturing and Power-to-X solutions.

Thriving in the age of global digitalization.This includes digital services and data centers.

Extracting the potential of natural resources. This includes agri-foods, oil and gas, and critical minerals.

By 2040, these sectors could generate combined annual revenues of approximately $590 billion to $ 1.2 trillion, depending on the pace of investment, degree of policy alignment, and global demand (Exhibit 3). Achieving this growth would require cumulative investment of $1.7 trillion to $2.8 trillion through 2040.

Our analysis seeks to be ambitious and feasible while presenting a consistent view across sectors. Since the potential revenues of several sectors—next-gen manufacturing (including EVs and batteries), critical minerals, oil and gas, and Power-to-X—rely on the pace of the energy transition, we incorporated its potential impact on revenue calculations across sectors. We based the estimation of outputs for these sectors on two energy transition scenarios: continued momentum and sustainable transformation. For six of the seven sectors, continued momentum represents the low output and sustainable transformation is the high output. Oil and gas is the exception: Continued momentum is the low case, and slow evolution is the high case. When aggregating opportunities across sectors, we combined the range for oil and gas inversely with those of the others. Each sector scenario includes specific factors that are explained in the methodology section in the full report’s appendix.

For each sector, we identified the countries with the greatest potential and classified them into four archetypes, defined by the sector’s overall maturity within each country:

Global champions include regional players accounting for more than 10 percent of global exports, top five exporters, and countries with the potential to become even more relevant in the future, given emerging global trends.

Strong competitors are countries that have established robust capabilities (such as labor or technology) in a given sector but are not yet global leaders. Strong competitors are well positioned to enhance their global relevance as emerging trends reshape opportunities.

Promising contenders are regional players that hold a potential competitive edge but need to strengthen capabilities and invest in enablers to fully capture the opportunity.

Emerging frontiers are high-potential countries whose competitiveness depends on overcoming significant uncertainty through coordinated efforts and alignment among key stakeholders.

This categorization of archetypes applies to country–industry pairs, using industries within the seven sectors. It is done at the industry level because industries within the same sector in the same country could be categorized as different archetypes. For instance, Argentina’s critical minerals sector is a global champion in lithium production but a promising contender in copper, illustrating the multifaceted nature of competitiveness and the importance of strategies tailored to each industry’s stage of development. In cases where relevant opportunities did not exist for country–industry pairs, they were not categorized as an archetype.

The following interactive offers deep dives into the seven sectors, highlighting potential additional revenues, the investment required to capture the opportunity, and the performance of selected Latin American countries.

Latin America has an opportunity to transform its productivity trajectory. These seven sectors illustrate the potential across the three themes that could leverage similar capabilities. By capturing the total economic potential by 2040, the region could substantially accelerate productivity growth.

Achieving these goals would require targeted action to close capability gaps and address structural barriers. By focusing investment and policies on these areas, the region can build the skills, infrastructure, and institutional capacity needed to accelerate economic growth and create prosperity for its population in the decades ahead.

Strategic accelerators: Unlocking growth in Latin America

The sector-specific opportunities could not only have an outsize impact but also catalyze a virtuous cycle of investment and growth. To execute this strategy, we have identified four strategic accelerators that could enable the region to increase its productivity at an economy-wide level. The first two aim to take advantage of the opportunities from shifting trade patterns; the other two are capability accelerators that could help attract investment and drive productivity growth.

Diversifying and proactively opening new trade corridors

Geopolitical tensions are altering global trade. Since 2017, commerce between geopolitically distant partners has fallen, indicating the reconfiguration of trade is underway. To understand the impact of factors such as tariffs and industrial policy on trade, McKinsey research explored three scenarios, developed using the Global Trade Analysis Project. McKinsey Global Institute analysis found that more than 30 percent of global trade in 2035 could swing from one trade corridor to another.

Latin America could seek to double down on trade by opening and exploring new trade corridors. Each new one could not only create demand for the region’s production but also attract targeted investments and technology partnerships in high-growth sectors. The creation of robust trade corridors with key (and sometimes new) global trading partners would likely depend on strong agreements and cooperative frameworks. In addition, clear and predictable trade policies, together with reciprocal commitments such as local investment in priority sectors, can help strengthen the resilience and adaptability of the region’s trade network.

As noted in chapter 3 of the full report, four strategic sectors rely heavily on external demand beyond the United States: Power-to-X, agri-food, oil and gas, and critical minerals. Expanding and building new interregional corridors, such as to the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia, could also increase Latin America’s trade with emerging markets, which are expected to see above-average growth and could offer stability amid global uncertainty.

Enhancing intraregional collaboration and investment

Regional integration in Latin America remains limited relative to other major economic blocs. Its intraregional exports currently make up only about 15 percent of its total exports versus 60 percent for the European Union. Gaps in physical connectivity—particularly cross-border road and transport networks—contribute to this dynamic and remain a focus for future development.

Latin America has an opportunity to diversify its trade relations while deepening its regional integration. These twin actions could bolster the region’s resilience and strengthen connectivity among its markets. Progress would require expanding and modernizing regional trade agreements to systematically lower trade barriers, standardizing regulations, and promoting the development of cross-border supply chains and investment flows.

Regional integration can benefit most sectors, but it is essential for next-gen manufacturing. Both intermediate products (minerals, batteries, and car parts) and final products (EVs) rely on a robust supply chain. In addition, intraregional trade of energy and fossil fuels could create more-reliable energy grids.

Streamlining regulatory frameworks in key sectors

A welcoming business environment is essential for sectors where Latin America needs to attract both investment and expertise. The region’s capacity to develop complex industries such as EVs and semiconductors relies heavily on its ability to draw the right companies and technology. This effort will benefit from ongoing collaboration between public and private stakeholders to address administrative and operational bottlenecks. As laid out in the full report, a welcoming business environment created through good governance and successful investment is mutually reinforcing and can get stronger over time.

Initiatives that enhance regulatory clarity, predictability, and efficiency—particularly in priority sectors—could strengthen investor confidence and unlock stalled projects, supporting broader competitiveness across the region. Actions could involve streamlining regulatory processes and making business setup, permits, and dispute resolution more efficient while maintaining transparency and rigor. A successful effort could unlock billions of dollars in stalled projects and increase the region’s competitiveness as a manufacturing hub.

Moreover, establishing the appropriate regulatory environments could accelerate growth in sectors such as critical minerals, oil and gas, and Power-to-X, which require substantial investment and where new projects take considerable time to become operational. Efforts that enhance regulatory clarity, predictability, and efficiency—particularly in priority sectors—could strengthen investor confidence and unlock stalled projects, supporting broader competitiveness across the region.

Upskilling the future workforce

In many regions, the misalignment between educational institutions and the demands of the job market has grown considerably over the past 20 years. This situation is particularly relevant in Latin America: For example, 80 percent of companies in Colombia anticipate a shortage of skilled workers by 2027. At the same time, 84 percent of employers in Latin America plan to upskill their workforce to meet the demand for digital and tech talent.

Efforts to strengthen skills and technology adoption would likely hinge on expanding access to high-quality education and targeted training programs. Collaborative initiatives involving government, academia, and the private sector have the potential to accelerate progress, particularly if implemented at scale. Bridging the region’s talent gap would spur growth across the economy, but such efforts would have an outsize impact on certain sectors, such as digital services, data centers, and next-gen manufacturing (semiconductors and EV production).

Over the past 25 years, Latin America’s GDP growth has trailed global averages and primarily been sustained by an expanding labor force. Now, the region must enhance its productivity to meet rising economic and social needs—including education, healthcare, and social security.

Latin America is at a pivotal moment, when strategic actions can significantly reshape its economic future. This report lays out a pathway that could enable the region to increase its GDP from $6.2 trillion in 2023 to between $8.9 trillion and $10.3 trillion by 2040, sufficient to achieve high-income status.

The region could overcome a challenging macroeconomic context—not through undertaking wholesale change but by focusing on the success of specific sectors with the potential to unleash a new wave of investment and growth in the region. These strategic opportunities, which arise from the match between current and future global trends and the region’s distinctive assets, encompass three broad themes: revitalizing its industrial base, thriving in the digital age, and leveraging its natural resources. Successful efforts could help to extend investment across the region’s economy.

Fully capitalizing on these opportunities requires decisive action. Mobilizing capital, adding new trade corridors, deepening intraregional trade, modernizing regulation, and building human capital could substantially improve Latin America’s resilience and responsiveness to global shifts and close persistent investment and productivity gaps. The result could be a clear path to sustainable growth.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/americas/seizing%20the%20moment%20latin%20americas%20productivity%20opportunity/gettyimages-1144228456-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:00:19.108019

More than 75% of Duke Energy customers in the region now benefit from this technology.
This room would be completely full of people working to dispatch crews and restore power,"" McCord said.
McCord said Duke Energy continues investing in grid improvements, including pole and line upgrades, capacity additions and expanding smart technology deployment.
""Duke Energy is always investing to improve the grid reliability for our customers,"" McCord said.","HARRISON, Ohio — When winter weather strikes — or really, any major storm — and power lines go down, utility crews spring into action across southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky. But behind every field repair is a sophisticated operation most customers never see: Duke Energy's Midwest Power Distribution Control Center in Harrison.

The state-of-the-art, 140,000 square foot facility serves as the brain of the electrical grid, where dozens of operators work around the clock to manage power distribution for 800,000 customers across Ohio and Kentucky.

""This facility is responsible for managing all the technology out on the grid,"" said Joshua McCord, director of operations for Duke Energy Distribution Control Centers Midwest.

The control center, which opened in 2021, represents a dramatic shift from the utility industry's past. Gone are the days when customers had to call to report outages and crews had to patrol entire sections of power lines to find problems.

""We had no visibility into the system. It was just poles and wires,"" McCord said.

Now, advanced technology allows operators to pinpoint outages and dispatch crews to specific locations. Smart devices installed throughout the grid communicate directly with the control center, providing real-time information about system conditions.

WATCH: Go behind-the-scenes in the power distribution control center

Duke Energy says smart grid technology prevented nearly 400K outages this year

Self-healing technology

One of the center's newest tools is called ""self-healing technology"" — a system that automatically reroutes electricity when problems occur, similar to how GPS navigation finds alternate routes around traffic.

When a car hits a power pole or a tree falls on lines, McCord said the technology can instantly detect the problem and redirect power around the damaged area. What might have left 1,800 customers without power now affects only 250 customers, who experience brief flickers as the system switches power sources, McCord said.

""Those customers would have seen a blink. And so that's the lights flashing sometimes, sometimes once or twice or three times,"" McCord said.

This year alone, the self-healing technology has prevented nearly 400,000 customer outages in Ohio and Kentucky, saving nearly 1.4 million hours of total outage time, according to Duke Energy. More than 75% of Duke Energy customers in the region now benefit from this technology.

McCord said the impact becomes clear when comparing today's capabilities to past storms. During Hurricane Ike in 2008, some customers went without power for over a week. The self-healing technology didn't exist then.

""The improvements that we've made since that time would have an impact on restoration, because of those self-healing teams, because of the electronic devices we're putting out on the system,"" he said. ""There would be situations that occurred then where customers were out for a long duration that they may only see a blink in today's time with all the self-healing equipment that we have out there.""

Operators manage the grid 24/7

The control center operates with a demanding schedule. Thirty operators rotate through 12-hour shifts, working every day of the year.

During severe weather events, the facility becomes a hub of intense activity, McCord said. Ice storms pose particular challenges, as ice accumulation on power lines and trees can cause widespread outages. Wind, thunderstorms and lightning also create significant problems for the electrical grid.

""If there was a major icing event, we would experience outages. This room would be completely full of people working to dispatch crews and restore power,"" McCord said.

Even during routine cold spells, operators stay busy managing system loads as customers increase their electricity usage for heating, hot water and lighting.

The operators undergo extensive training — a rigorous two-year program followed by annual continuing education requirements to maintain their certification to operate the grid safely.

Technology and humans working together

While artificial intelligence may play a larger role in grid operations in the future, McCord said that human oversight remains essential, especially for safety-critical decisions involving high-voltage equipment.

""My personal hope is that we always see people in the room,"" McCord said. ""We have a lot of high voltages; it can be hazardous work, and so making sure our crew's safety is paramount.""

The Harrison facility is one of five distribution control centers Duke Energy operates across its service territory, which includes locations in St. Petersburg, Florida; Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina; and Plainfield, Indiana.

McCord said Duke Energy continues investing in grid improvements, including pole and line upgrades, capacity additions and expanding smart technology deployment.

""Duke Energy is always investing to improve the grid reliability for our customers,"" McCord said. ""The customer is number one. Every single person in this room is focused on the fact that they know a customer is without power, and they treat it with that level of sincerity and that level of criticality.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/88008e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3538x1857+0+68/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Fa9%2Fb37dad944e039859e3ff9174863b%2Fscreenshot-2025-12-16-at-4-53-06-pm.png,N,,2025-12-17 17:04:56.962982

“Solar is the most scalable, reliable, and low-cost energy available today, and I look forward to the future of American solar running through Rockdale, Texas,” added Barcelo.
However, the lack of clarity on the Section 232 ruling has left many unanswered questions for the US solar manufacturing sector, particularly for polysilicon, as US module manufacturing capacity has grown much faster than polysilicon manufacturing capacity.
For their part, T1’s partners expressed optimism today that the deals put in place with the company would help deliver a robust US solar supply chain.","Cells will be used in the construction of modules at T1’s G1 Dallas module manufacturing plant, which the company acquired from Trina Solar last December as part of its rebrand from Freyr Battery and its move from the battery sector to the solar manufacturing industry.

The company has already seen significant demand for its modules—selling 725MW of modules in the third quarter of this year, driving sales volume of US$200-210 million—and the addition of cell manufacturing will expand a production line that makes heavy use of US-based manufacturing.

In August, T1 signed a supply deal with US ceramics and glass producer Corning to acquire polysilicon and wafers from the company and its subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor, from a manufacturing facility in Michigan. Then, in October, the company signed a deal to acquire steel module frames from US tracker manufacturer NEXTPower, then known as Nextracker, for use in its modules. T1 chairman and CEO Dan Barcelo said today that both deals, and the production of cells at the G2 Austin facility, would help deliver an “integrated US polysilicon solar supply chain”.

“Solar is the most scalable, reliable, and low-cost energy available today, and I look forward to the future of American solar running through Rockdale, Texas,” added Barcelo.

Building a domestic supply chain

The milestone is an important development for the US solar manufacturing industry, which has sought to bring online more capacity, particularly of wafers and cells, in recent months. T1 praised the Trump administration’s “pro-growth economic and trade policies”, likely referring to the wave of tariffs placed on imported goods and investigations into imports from Chinese-backed firms in an effort to stimulate domestic manufacturing.

This sentiment echoes comments made by T1 in July, when it said that the Department of Commerce’s (DOC’s) Section 232 investigation into polysilicon imports “will result in strengthening US energy security and boosting American advanced manufacturing”, by determining how polysilicon imports to the US should be affected by tariffs and other trade policies.

However, the lack of clarity on the Section 232 ruling has left many unanswered questions for the US solar manufacturing sector, particularly for polysilicon, as US module manufacturing capacity has grown much faster than polysilicon manufacturing capacity. Figures from Solar Media Market Research show that, by the end of 2025, the US is expected to lack 18GW of domestic polysilicon manufacturing capacity to meet its annual module manufacturing capacity, creating a gap that would have to be plugged by foreign imports, exactly the kind of imports that would be targeted by a strict Section 232 ruling.

For their part, T1’s partners expressed optimism today that the deals put in place with the company would help deliver a robust US solar supply chain.

“Corning is proud to supply G2 Austin with wafers that will power the next chapter in American-made solar technology,” said AB Ghosh, vice-president of solar at Corning, chairman and CEO of Hemlock Semiconductor.

A new report projects that home heating costs will rise by 9.2 percent this winter, with colder temperatures and increasing energy prices playing a role.

The report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), which represents state governments in securing federal funding, projects that households will spend $995 on heating this winter, an increase of $84 from last winter. Costs for households using electric and natural gas heaters will increase by 12.2 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively.

The Hill has reached out to the Department of Energy for comment.

The projected increases significantly outpace the overall rate of inflation, which hit 3 percent in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). That same month, energy costs were up 2.8 percent relative to 12 months prior, while electricity and natural gas prices were up 5.1 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively.

The BLS will release inflation data for November on Thursday, after not collecting it for October due to the 43-day government shutdown.

The NEADA also noted in its report that an average monthly electric bill has increased by 29.2 percent since 2021, while natural gas prices have risen by nearly 50 percent over the past year.

“These increases may not sound dramatic to higher-income households, but for families already struggling, they are devastating,” NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe said in the report. “Millions of households are being pushed deeper into utility debt and closer to shutoffs simply because they cannot afford to keep their homes warm.”

Meanwhile, Congress has allocated $4 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), down from $6.1 billion in 2023. In the report, the NEADA called on the legislative branch to increase funding for the LIHEAP to prior levels and invest in grid modernization and clean energy sources.

Utility prices will likely play a key role in the 2026 midterms, after Democratic candidates in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City pledged to tackle the cost of living en route to victory in November.

President Trump campaigned on tackling inflation, including with regard to energy prices, throughout the 2024 campaign. But amid growing affordability concerns from Americans, including his own supporters, the president began a domestic tour in Pennsylvania last week to tout his administration’s work to lower costs.

“Energy is one of Louisiana’s greatest competitive advantages,” President and CEO of Entergy Louisiana Phillip May said. “Our ability to deliver reliable, scalable power while maintaining some of the lowest electricity rates in the country gives companies like Hut 8 the confidence to invest here, fueling economic growth and creating long-term value for our customers and communities.”

The State of Louisiana has positioned itself as a premier destination for global-scale projects like River Bend through a competitive portfolio of incentive programs. Hut 8 is expected to participate in Louisiana’s state and local sales and use tax rebate on qualifying purchases or leases of data center equipment, established in Act 730 of the 2024 Regular Legislative Session. Hut 8 also plans to participate in the state’s Quality Jobs program.

“River Bend demonstrates that Louisiana’s economic strategy is taking our state from plans to progress,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “This project will generate high-wage jobs and create pathways for Louisianans to build long-term careers in the industries of the future. It’s a clear example of how aligning policy, partnership and people translates into lasting opportunity.”

Construction on the data center is already underway with operations expected to commence by the second quarter of 2027.

“West Feliciana Parish is proud to welcome Hut 8 and River Bend to our community,” said Parish President Kenny Havard. “This is a once-in-a-generation project that will bring jobs, opportunity, and investment to our parish for decades to come. It shows what’s possible when local, state, and industry partners work together toward a shared vision of growth and progress.”

Hut 8’s River Bend campus builds on Louisiana’s momentum of landmark economic development projects over the past year that have reshaped the state’s economy and strengthening its global competitiveness. In the past year, Louisiana has secured milestone investments including Meta’s $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana and Hyundai Steel Company’s nearly $6 billion investment to establish its first North American manufacturing facility in Donaldsonville.

“We’re pleased to see Hut 8 reach this milestone in the Capital Region,” President and CEO of the Greater Baton Rouge Economic Partnership Lori Melancon said. “This is a great win for West Feliciana Parish, and it reflects the continued momentum across the Capital Region as a strong place for new and growing industries.”

In July, Wisconsin regulators approved a 20MW/200MWh long-duration energy storage (LDES) project by Energy Dome and Alliant Energy.

Federal policy changes The US utility-scale storage market is expected to shrink by 11% in 2026 and 8% in 2027 year-over-year as supply chains adapt and domestic manufacturing increases.
Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie said of the report, “Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong.","Notably, Wisconsin installed 210MW over Q2 and Q3. In October, Wisconsin utility Alliant Energy integrated its first 100MW/400MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), next to a 200MW solar project in Grant County.

In July, Wisconsin regulators approved a 20MW/200MWh long-duration energy storage (LDES) project by Energy Dome and Alliant Energy.

In Q3 2025, community-scale, commercial, and industrial (CCI) storage was predominantly in California, which accounted for 54% of installations. Illinois also became a significant market, representing 4% of deployments.

Residential storage installations increased by 8% quarter-over-quarter, led by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates reached new peaks and larger capacity systems gained market share.

Puerto Rico experienced the highest quarter-over-quarter growth in installations, mainly due to high retail power prices and ongoing demand for resiliency. Meanwhile, North Carolina and Arizona achieved record quarterly installation levels in Q3 2025, influenced by the PowerPair Programme and decreasing solar export rates, respectively.

Forecasted installations

ACP and Wood Mackenzie forecast that 92.9GW/317.9GWh of storage will be installed in the US over the next five years, driven by project economics and policy incentives.

The utility-scale storage five-year forecast has grown by 15% following the passage of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ (‘OBBBA’), which, during its lengthy negotiations, had initially led Wood Mackenzie to lower its expectations. In the Q2 edition of the report, published just a few days before the legislation passed for final debate in the Senate, the research firm estimated that, had the bill eliminated tax credits for energy storage, it could have led to a 29% fall in utility-scale deployments in 2026.

Deployment is fuelled by ongoing access to the investment tax credit (ITC), competitive domestic cell manufacturing costs, merchant revenue opportunities, state policies, and load growth.

Wood Mackenzie anticipates the C&I storage market will reach an additional 892MW between 2025 and 2029 as programmes like California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) 3.0, and Illinois’ rebate initiatives mature, alongside expanding wholesale market access.

Federal policy changes

The US utility-scale storage market is expected to shrink by 11% in 2026 and 8% in 2027 year-over-year as supply chains adapt and domestic manufacturing increases.

However, it is projected to bounce back in 2028 and 2029 with double-digit year-over-year growth once domestic cell supply becomes more accessible. In the Q3 edition of the report, Wood Mackenzie had said that, although demand remained strong, the OBBBA and global trade uncertainty could still lead to a 10% year-over-year fall in utility-scale installations in 2027.

Responses in distributed storage show mixed results. The CCI segment will continue steady growth despite federal restrictions, mainly because deployments are focused in California, Massachusetts, New York, and Illinois, which offer significant state incentives.

Meanwhile, the residential storage sector is predicted to decline by 6% in 2026 due to the removal of Section 25D ITC, with residential solar facing an even sharper drop of 18%.

Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie said of the report, “Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong. Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-82.png,N,,2025-12-17 11:02:40.253881

About NRDC NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists.","WASHINGTON STATE – With the prospect of people across the country losing out on the benefits from cleaner transportation, today, Sierra Club, Climate Solutions, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), and Earthjustice filed a new challenge to the Trump administration’s hold on $2.5 billion in federal funding through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program.

The federal government had awarded more than 140 charging grants totaling nearly $1.8 billion to local and state agencies and tribes to fund crucial community charging and transportation corridor projects. However, the Trump administration froze the vast majority of these funds, meaning neither funds under those grants nor new grants have been moving forward. As a result, the transportation projects across the country promised by this program are in jeopardy, and more people will be harmed by pollution from extracting, transporting and burning gasoline to power vehicles with internal combustion engines.

These charging grants have a particular emphasis on reducing emissions from the transportation sector, a big source of air pollution. In addition to contributing to the climate crisis, pollution from burning fossil fuels to power vehicles creates major public health threats for millions of Americans and especially dangerous for marginalized communities across the nation that often live next to major freight corridors due to the history of redlining. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are harmed by vehicle pollution every year.

The groups’ lawsuit follows a lawsuit filed earlier today by 16 states and the District of Columbia in federal court for the Western District of Washington. Led by California, Colorado, and Washington, other states filing include Arizona, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

QUOTES FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF FILING ORGANIZATIONS:

“We’re suing to unlock clean energy infrastructure funds that have been promised to communities for cleaner vehicles, cleaner air, and good jobs. If this Congress-approved money isn’t used, it disappears—exactly what the Trump administration is hoping will happen. We won’t let the Trump administration sit on it any longer,” said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Zachary Fabish.

“This program will cut emissions, improve mobility, and expand charging access, especially in the communities that need it most. This unlawful freeze has stalled projects that local governments and tribes have already planned for and invested in. The longer it goes on, the more projects that are at risk. The administration must end this unlawful hold and release the funds that Congress mandated on a bipartisan basis,"" said Beth Hammon, a senior advocate at NRDC.

“Washington drivers want clean, fast and affordable ways to get around. This funding being unlawfully blocked by the Trump administration should be helping power up and connect rural communities across our state from Mount Vernon and Port Angeles to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. Threatening the funding for these promised projects is an attempt to delay Washington's progress while we are stuck paying the price through higher costs and more pollution,” said James Hove, Washington Director at Climate Solutions.

“People want and deserve access to reliable electric vehicle charging, and it’s egregious that the administration is taking us backwards. The impacts of the Trump administration's reckless decision to freeze funds already allocated by Congress are stark. Without dollars flowing to modernize our infrastructure, Americans will continue to live with polluted air and an outdated system stuck in the early 2000s,” said Marvin C. Brown IV, senior attorney at Earthjustice.

Additional Background:

The CFI program was created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which appropriated $2.5 billion for the program over five years. It represents one of two major federal funding programs for critical electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the other being the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program.

In May, our organizations (alongside others) filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful freeze of the NEVI program, a transformative, $5 billion national initiative to build electric vehicle charging stations along major highway corridors and to enable long-distance EV travel across the country.

In that lawsuit, a federal judge issued a preliminary order directing the federal government to release NEVI funding, and the Trump administration responded by beginning to restart the program in August.

The utility said combining Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas will “unlock more than $1 billion in net system savings to customers,” though the final amount could vary.
The University of Massachusetts Amherst’s analysis of 2022 data ranked Duke Energy as the nation’s third-largest carbon emitter.
Instead, Duke Energy plans to slowly merge existing rate schedules over multiple rate cases until both current service territories pay the same rates.
That new analysis projected potential savings of approximately $2.3 billion from 2027-2040,” Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton wrote in a written statement to WFAE.","Duke Energy has begun the process of fully combining its two service territories, a dozen years after Duke Energy merged with Progress Energy. This week, state regulators hosted public hearings on the utility’s proposal.

The utility said combining Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas will “unlock more than $1 billion in net system savings to customers,” though the final amount could vary. Duke provided a written statement to WFAE that these savings would result from “planning and execution for future resources and operational efficiencies.”

Tuesday night, two members of the public testified before state regulators during a virtual public hearing. Asheville-based Rachel Cohen commented on Duke’s pending rate hike proposal, a separate case.

“Raising rates for customers now, on the cusp of a deal that should lower Duke’s costs and increase profits for shareholders, doesn’t make a lot of sense for me, and I think it’s a bad deal for ratepayers,” Cohen said.

Cohen proposed holding off on any rate hikes until after January 2027, when the business combination would be complete.

Duke Energy filed a proposal to raise rates for all customers in November. The proposed rate hikes would increase Duke Energy’s revenues by over $1.7 billion.

Raleigh-based Gary Smith, chair of the North Carolina Council of Churches, said the group urged Duke Energy to increase its environmental commitments as part of the combination. He encouraged Duke to adopt, as company policy, the original interim carbon-pollution reduction target, which would require the utility to lower carbon emissions to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030.

“Summers here have become hotter, ocean levels continue to rise and storms have become more severe,” Smith said. “All of these are making life more difficult for North Carolinians.”

Burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of human-caused climate change, which scientists have linked to rising temperatures, elevated sea levels and worsening storms. The University of Massachusetts Amherst’s analysis of 2022 data ranked Duke Energy as the nation’s third-largest carbon emitter.

The combination would take effect Jan. 1, 2027. It would not impact the current rate case proceedings, in which Duke Energy is requesting the following adjustments to rates:

Residential rates for DEC customers would increase 11.9% in 2027 and 4% in 2028.

Residential rates for DEP customers would increase 14.1% in 2027 and 3.5% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEC customers would increase 8.7% in 2027 and 3.9% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEP customers would increase 9.2% in 2027 and 4.6% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEC customers would increase 6.3% in 2027 and 3.4% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEP customers would increase 7.4% in 2027 and 4.3% in 2028.

Instead, Duke Energy plans to slowly merge existing rate schedules over multiple rate cases until both current service territories pay the same rates.

“We supplemented our filing in October with new analysis based on updated modeling in the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

The more than 50-year-old facility – Washington state’s last remaining coal plant – was slated for conversion to natural gas, under a long-standing agreement between the state of Washington and the plant’s owner.

DOE’s latest mandate, issued late Tuesday, follows orders issued earlier this year forcing the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in Michigan and the Eddystone oil-and-gas plant in Pennsylvania to stay open past their retirement dates, which public interest groups have challenged. DOE has repeatedly extended the emergency orders for both plants, despite evidence that both plants are unreliable, highly-polluting facilities, and are not necessary to meet near or long-term energy needs. Financial filings show that the Campbell plant alone racked up $80 million in net losses – over $600,000 every day during the months of June through the end of September. Those costs are being recovered from households and businesses across 11 states in the Midwest, even though the regional grid had more than enough electric power over that period.

“Once again, the Trump administration is upending state and local decisions to force an aging, costly, polluting coal plant to stay open,” said Ted Kelly, Director and Lead Counsel for U.S. Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund.

“Like we’ve seen with the Michigan coal plant, it’s households and businesses that end up paying out of pocket to keep these old, uneconomic plants on life support. It’s completely unnecessary, since years and years went into carefully planning the retirement of Washington’s last coal plant and shifting the grid to cleaner, more affordable power sources.

“Unfortunately, households and businesses across the region can expect higher electricity bills and more asthma-causing pollution in the new year.”

This week, state regulators hosted public hearings on the utility’s proposal.

The utility said combining Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas will “unlock more than $1 billion in net system savings to customers,” though the final amount could vary. Duke provided a written statement to WFAE that these savings would result from “planning and execution for future resources and operational efficiencies.”

Tuesday night, two members of the public testified before state regulators during a virtual public hearing. Asheville-based Rachel Cohen commented on Duke’s pending rate hike proposal, a separate case.

“Raising rates for customers now, on the cusp of a deal that should lower Duke’s costs and increase profits for shareholders, doesn’t make a lot of sense for me, and I think it’s a bad deal for ratepayers,” Cohen said.

Cohen proposed holding off on any rate hikes until after January 2027, when the business combination would be complete.

Duke Energy filed a proposal to raise rates for all customers in November. The proposed rate hikes would increase Duke Energy’s revenues by over $1.7 billion.

Raleigh-based Gary Smith, chair of the North Carolina Council of Churches, said the group urged Duke Energy to increase its environmental commitments as part of the combination. He encouraged Duke to adopt, as company policy, the original interim carbon-pollution reduction target, which would require the utility to lower carbon emissions to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030.

“Summers here have become hotter, ocean levels continue to rise and storms have become more severe,” Smith said. “All of these are making life more difficult for North Carolinians.”

Burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of human-caused climate change, which scientists have linked to rising temperatures, elevated sea levels and worsening storms. The University of Massachusetts Amherst’s analysis of 2022 data ranked Duke Energy as the nation’s third-largest carbon emitter.

The combination would take effect Jan. 1, 2027. It would not impact the current rate case proceedings, in which Duke Energy is requesting the following adjustments to rates:

Residential rates for DEC customers would increase 11.9% in 2027 and 4% in 2028.

Residential rates for DEP customers would increase 14.1% in 2027 and 3.5% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEC customers would increase 8.7% in 2027 and 3.9% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEP customers would increase 9.2% in 2027 and 4.6% in 2028.

Read more about the partnership.

Federal tax incentives for clean energy upgrades are going away at the end of this year, cutting into potential savings on rooftop solar, heat pumps and more.

In 2026, homeowners who install a heat pump will no longer be able to apply for federal tax credits amounting to 30% off installation costs or new equipment.

At the same time, a pilot program from Central Maine Power that charged a lower rate in the winter to certain customers with heat pumps is also set to expire.

This means that homeowners may see costs associated with installing and running a heat pump go up next year, particularly as electricity rates continue to climb. Maine’s average electricity prices increased at the third highest rate in the country over the last decade, a previous analysis by The Maine Monitor found.

The federal energy efficiency tax credits, established under Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, are set to expire earlier than planned because of changes made this summer in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Federal home energy rebates for low- and moderate-income families, however, will remain in place.

Efficiency Maine Trust, the quasi-state agency responsible for energy programs, plans to continue offering several types of heat pump rebates, including up to $9,000 for low-income customers and up to $3,000 for any income level.

Efficiency Maine has no plans to modify its heat pump incentives when the federal tax credits expire, according to Executive Director Michael Stoddard. Funding for the heat pump rebates comes from a variety of sources, including electric utilities, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act and a grant from the federal Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Other efforts to increase heat pump adoption and make them more affordable are underway.

Maine is part of a five-state coalition called the New England Heat Pump Accelerator, a $450 million effort that launched last month to get more heat pumps installed by offering financial incentives to distributors and contractors; supporting new pilot programs and workforce development efforts; and improving educational outreach. The accelerator was funded with money from the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program created by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Maine surpassed Gov. Janet Mills’s goal to install 100,000 heat pumps by 2025 back in 2023. Now the state is working toward installing 275,000 units by 2027.

Maine Won’t Wait, the state’s climate action plan, tallied 143,000 heat pumps installed at the end of 2024. Rebates, combined with energy bill savings, have made heat pumps a popular alternative to heating systems that use oil, gas or propane.

Whereas traditional heating systems can only turn on and off, a heat pump can ramp up and down, said Shawn LaPlante, co-owner of LaPlante Home Services in Scarborough.

“It can use a little bit of electricity. It can use a lot of electricity when it needs it, and then it can go back down to a little bit of electricity. So it has the ability to vary,” LaPlante said.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, as The Maine Monitor has previously reported, cost savings associated with heat pumps have become a key part of the sales pitch. The clean energy think tank RMI calculated that, in Maine, a household can expect an average of $700 in energy bill savings annually after switching from delivered fuel to a heat pump.

Ryan Shea is the manager of RMI’s buildings team, which focuses on research and policies related to reducing carbon emissions and boosting efficiency. Shea said the annual cost savings calculations were made using RMI’s Green Upgrade Calculator, which factors in details about a given home, such as its size and when it was built, as well as energy rates, heat pump type and climate.

“There really is a lot that goes into quantifying energy bills, especially when you’re switching fuels,” Shea said. “What this tool tries to do is factor in all of those inputs and generate an output that’s quite accurate.”

When stacked against the cost of installation, LaPlante said most customers can expect to make back their initial investment in five to eight years, depending on their circumstances. LaPlante said there’s been a “slight uptick” in the number of customers looking to install heat pumps since the change was announced to the federal tax credits.

“This just gave them a little push to say, well, why not, because I can get the federal tax credit,” LaPlante said. “It’s an extra $2,000 potentially, so I think that allowed them to push up their timeline, but they had to have already been thinking about it.”",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/Climate-Heat-Pump-Announcement.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-17 13:01:06.424137

Well, technically, it has been there since Trump took office. This is a weird period in automotive history; A chunk of the industry is full-steam ahead with EV development, another is cutting back, and the consumer is left wondering what the electrification landscape will look like next year, let alone in three, during the next administration.

But what about the automotive aftermarket? Typically, this corner benefits from whatever progress is made on the OEM front—have Trump’s policies expanded or contracted its EV technological development? I recently spent some time chatting with personnel of the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) at its yearly tradeshow in Las Vegas to find out. I also hit the bricks (or, rather, bright carpeting) of the massive show itself, seeking out some new, unique developments in the space that behoove EV tech’s inherent benefits.

Above one of the show’s several sprawling halls, I met with Mike Spagnola, SEMA’s CEO, and Karen Bailey-Chapman, senior vice president, public and government affairs, to learn what the organization’s official stance is. First and foremost: It doesn’t want to be told what to do.

Trump-like talking points

“Thirty-three percent of our industry would’ve been wiped out had EV mandates continued,” Bailey-Chapman said, referring to future federal fuel efficiency regulations that would have required automakers to sell many more EVs to avoid punishing fines. Those efficiency targets were just ripped up by the Trump administration.

“The reality is that we embrace EVs, we embrace all technologies. If it moves on wheels, we’re good… but what we are against is that we have to choose this, and that’s it,” she said.

She claimed that over the past couple of years, SEMA has become more political than ever before, advocating heavily for what it finds to be the best way forward for its members. Part of that includes limiting the power of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which was given the power to regulate California’s air quality after decades of smog affected the Los Angeles basin.

“We’re not against EVs; we just think that all technology should move forward,” Spagnola added. “We’re environmentally respectful—we do a lot of work with CARB and the EPA—but we think technology should move forward, and you should have a choice of what you drive.” Indeed, SEMA has an emissions lab in Diamond Bar, California, to help its member companies create a wide range of products that meet stringent CARB-level requirements.

On one hand, not giving American consumers the choice is counter to how our economy functions, and it limits technological progress. If there are benefits to be found, they typically are found no matter what, especially in the name of horsepower, chassis development, and so on. But on the other hand, stricter guidelines also breed innovation. Increasing emissions and fuel economy standards have gotten us to a level of internal combustion technology that we could have only dreamed of 30 years ago. Who’s to say the same wouldn’t happen with stricter requirements for electrification?

Talking about torque

After speaking with Spagnola and Bailey-Chapman, I ventured over to SEMA’s FutureTech Studio, where a handful of EV-centric companies were highlighted. Two immediately piqued my interest.

The first was Sierra, a company that specializes in customizable single-seater off-road chassis, including its assemble-it-yourself Echo, which uses an EV powertrain. The benefits of an EV powertrain are immediately noticeable in its packaging. The motor and battery sit far inboard from the rear axle, and due to their compact overall combined dimension, give it small dimensions that would be hard to match with any engine, transmission, and fuel tank.

But the real benefits are found elsewhere. “The biggest thing is torque application,” a company representative told me. “When you’re in off-road racing, going through whoops [and other trail features], I can get all the torque out of that motor instantaneously.” He also highlighted that there are just four moving parts instead of around 400 in an internal combustion-powered rig, so durability is less of a concern. To keep temperatures in check, it sports an active cooling system that flows glycol through the motor and high-velocity fans for the electronics. The application is intended for short-course desert racing that’s less than 200 miles (321 km), in addition to just going for a rip in the dirt.

Classic car top hats?

The next company made me reminisce about my freshman-year science class in the early ’00s, when I first learned that EVs could one day have skateboard chassis. Meaning, there would be a basic chassis that you could swap different bodies between. Elkington Motors of Provo, Utah, follows a similar concept: bolt a classic muscle car (particularly any gen-one Ford Mustang) or truck body onto a ready-to-go chassis.

The specs are appealing: 90 kWh battery, 508 hp (379 kW), 2,212 lb-ft (3,000 Nm), all-wheel drive, and around 220 miles (354 km) of range. All chassis, suspension, and accompanying electronics to make it work are part of the build. Even in the sea of shoulder-to-shoulder attendees, it was apparent how well-thought-out and beneficial this sort of EV conversion could be, especially to the intrepid DIYer.

Has aftermarket EV tech and development stalled in the wake of increased fuel efficiency and other clean vehicle regulations being off the table? It may be that all the advancements over the past decade have matured enough for the sector to take the basic concepts and run. The benefits are apparent (packaging, output potential, chassis engineering, fascinating traction control tuning, etc.), and there’s clearly enough work still being done to create some new and exciting developments.

But I also can’t help but think that progress may be slowed, at least here in the US. Less investment on the OEM side means less for the technologically talented among us to say “I can do that better,” a cornerstone of the aftermarket industry. Remember when turbocharging took F1 by storm in the ’70s and ’80s? It not only helped form the basis of what forced induction is today, but it also made for one of the series’ most fascinating eras. It would be a shame if we miss out on that on the EV front.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SEMAPhotos20251-1152x648.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:00:31.391502

It's Wednesday, December 17, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, a fairly sizable chunk of U.S. states are suing the federal government over President Trump's decision to suspend two EV charging programs that would have helped with infrastructure, the European Union has officially proposed killing off its 2035 combustion-engine ban, Scout Motors will be allowed to sell directly to customers in Colorado and Jeep is asking for forgiveness following 4xe recalls.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are suing the federal government in response to President Trump's decision to suspend two grant programs for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the President's Department of Transportation has refused to approve any new funding under two EV charging infrastructure programs created by Congress. They were part of the $1 trillion infrastructure law signed by former-President Biden in 2022.

This latest lawsuit is being led by the attorneys general of California and Colorado, but it has been joined by AGs from Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as the governor of Pennsylvania.

Back in June, a U.S. judge actually blocked Trump's plan to withhold funding awarded to 14 states from a seperate $5 billion electric vehicle charger infrastructure fund that was approved in 2022, so there's some precedent here. From Reuters:

""This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,"" Bonta said.

One of the programs directs $2.5 billion in funding to states and cities for EV charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The suit, led by California, Washington and Colorado, said Trump's action ""has placed $1.8 billion in federal awards to dozens of state and local governments in jeopardy and made the vast majority of these funds unavailable.""

[...]

Trump has taken aim at electric vehicles on a number of fronts. In June, the Republican president signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California's landmark plan to end sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 and two other vehicle rules.

Trump has also —rather infamously — signed legislation that killed the $7,500 EV tax credit, and earlier this month, he proposed slashing fuel economy standards the Biden Administration finalized last year. It's all part of an effort to make it easier for American automakers to sell gas-powered cars.

Let's hope this money can get flowing again so our EV infrastructure can be built up to where it needs to be. And, before you all start complaining about subsidies for the EV industry, ask yourself what sort of subsidies the oil and gas industry is getting.

The European Union is trashing its 2035 combustion engine ban after receiving a hell of a lot of pressure from the automotive industry, which has struggled to really make EVs catch on as quickly as it had hoped. Now, rather than requiring automakers to completely eliminate carbon-dioxide tailpipe emissions for new cars starting in 2035, the EU's new proposal calls for a 90% reduction from a baseline level. That remaining 10% would need to be made up through the use of low-carbon steel or from e-fuels and bio-diesel.

The European Commission said its plan maintains a strong market signal in favor of zero-emission vehicles while also giving automakers a bit more flexibility. It basically means that, along with full EVs and hydrogen vehicles, car companies can also sell plug-in hybrids, extended range electric vehicles and even some internal combustion-powered cars past the 2035 deadline.

At the moment, it's still just a proposal. It'll need to gain approval from the EU's member states and the European Parliament before it can become law. From The Wall Street Journal:

Industry groups said the proposal was a positive first step but raised questions about the details. The measures ""are too complex"" and won't be enough to protect production and jobs, the European Association of Automotive Suppliers said.

Carmakers had argued that the original 2035 target for zero emissions was unachievable because of a slower-than-expected uptake of EVs among consumers.

In Europe, automakers have had to price their EVs aggressively to hit regulatory targets this year, resulting in a surge in sales but weaker profits.

Volkswagen, for example, reported a loss for the third quarter. The region's largest carmaker said it sold more lower-margin EVs while its Porsche brand was hit by write-downs related to EV investments that hadn't yielded the expected returns.

Europe's vast complex of automotive suppliers is being particularly hard hit by the transition. EVs contain fewer of the mechanical parts the companies specialize in and more electronics, where Asian supply chains are dominant.

Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen—two of Europe's largest automotive suppliers—announced thousands of job cuts in recent months. A study by consulting company Roland Berger for the European Association of Automotive Suppliers found that as many as 350,000 jobs could be lost by 2030 if the current trend continues.

Obviously, I cannot see the future, but I've got a terrible feeling that in a few years, we're going to look back at these decisions being made by governments in the U.S. and Europe and be able to point to exactly where it all went wrong. We're going to be able to see exactly where tailpipe emissions got out of control, once and for all. Hopefully I'm wrong.

Scout Motors has wanted to do direct-to-customer sales from the get-go, and that hasn't really gone over so well with dealers. Still, it hasn't stopped the Volkswagen-owned SUV-maker from getting its dealer license in Colorado, which means it can indeed sell cars directly to buyers in the U.S.

Colorado's Motor Vehicle Dealer Board voted 6-2 to approve Scount's application to become a dealer in the state. As you may have imagined, dealers aren't thrilled about this development, and I'll tell you what: I don't give a rat's ass. From Automotive News:

""We're disappointed,"" Colorado Auto Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves told Automotive News. ""We have a law that specifically prohibits manufacturers from having control of the dealership and now the state's just granted a manufacturer control of the dealership.""

Scout's detailed roadmap to sell an electric SUV and pickup to American consumers includes experience centers, speedy purchase transactions, stores in key U.S. markets and a flexible nationwide service footprint at launch.

Denver was one of the first 25 markets Scout identified for brand-owned rooftops in October 2024.

Groves acknowledged that there is a loophole for Tesla, Rivian and Lucid to sell vehicles in Colorado because those are all-EV brands and do not have franchise agreements with legacy automakers.

Groves said Scout is financially backed by VW Group and plans to offer an extended-range EV energy system which will utilize a gasoline engine as a generator.

[...]

VW Group, VW Group of America and Scout maintain the startup is and will remain independent.

Right now, it's not clear how many locations Scout is planning to set up in Colorado or if it was granted licenses in other states as well, but we do know that its Colorado license is valid from December 16, 2025, through October 31, 2026. It'll allow the automaker to sell new, used and wholesale vehicles.

In a rare (and slightly strange) move, Jeep's CEO apologized and promised a $100 gift card in a note to 4xe plug-in hybrid owners who have been dealing with a slew of issues related to three separate battery fire recalls in the past two years.

CEO Bob Broderdorf said most Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe hybrids haven't been impacted by the battery problems, but he acknowledged recalls could be ""unsettling."" He asked owners of these troubled cars to ""Please accept our sincerest apologies."" Most recently, 320,065 owners were told to stop charging their 4xes and park them away from structures. From The Detroit News:

""As a valued member of the Jeep family, you deserve a reassuring ownership experience, and we are truly sorry if this situation caused any disappointment or concern,"" the email said. The brand is offering $100 Mastercard gift cards to ""cover unexpected fuel costs since you are being asked to not travel in EV mode,"" the CEO confirmed, while also providing loaner vehicles and extended warranties for the Samsung SDI-made high-voltage batteries.

The apology came as the Stellantis NV brand also released details to dealers for how to fix the Wrangler plug-in hybrids, though not yet the Grand Cherokee versions, after the battery recall was issued in late October. Owners began to book repairs on Tuesday.

The fix, as with the prior two Jeep battery recalls, doesn't involve immediately replacing the battery. Instead, it involves a software update that is supposed to be able to detect if there is damage in a battery component called a separator. If an issue is detected, battery charging will be disabled, the company said, at which point the battery will be replaced.

The company in a recent statement said it now has a ""deeper understanding of the factors involved"" and has found a ""more comprehensive remedy"" to fix it.

Aside from the latest ""park away from structures"" recall, the others involved a software update causing some 4xe drivers to suddenly lose power, as well as a really bizarre one that we told you about: sand in the engine that could cause a fire.

This is nothing a $100 gift card can't fix.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/federal-government-sued-by-16-states-over-trumps-decision-to-pull-ev-charger-programs/l-intro-1765984132.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:30.039851

The development could become one of Europe's first fully-integrated operations to produce lithium while also generating renewable energy.

The agreement involves a package of three contracts valued at over US$50m under which ABB is responsible for delivering the project's entire electrical infrastructure.

This remit includes powering Vulcan’s Lithium Extraction Plant in Landau, the Central Lithium Plant in Industriepark Höchst, near Frankfurt, and the surrounding well sites.

ABB will manage the full electrical scope of the project, from the high-voltage grid connection, down to building-level processes, ensuring a consistent and reliable power supply for the facility's operations.

Strategic partnership for EV supply chain

The partnership between Vulcan Energy and ABB could serve as a model for integrating clean energy production with advanced electrification.

Björn Jonsson Global Business Line Manager for Mining & Materials at ABB explained the project’s broader implications: “The Lionheart Project is a blueprint for how clean energy and advanced electrification go hand in hand.

“We are building the foundations for a stronger European battery supply chain, helping to meet growing demand for electric vehicles at a crucial point in the transition to clean mobility.”

The Lionheart Project is set to produce 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) each year. This refined lithium is a key component in battery manufacturing and the facility's output is projected to be sufficient to power approximately 500,000 electric vehicles annually.

Vulcan's integrated approach combines this lithium extraction with the generation of 275 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity and 560 GWh of heat contributing to both its industrial needs and wider clean energy objectives.

Offtake agreements and project funding

The facility’s integrated nature means Vulcan can supply lithium and renewable energy from a single location, which may offer a more sustainable option for downstream manufacturers in the battery supply chain.

Vulcan has secured ten-year offtake agreements to supply lithium from 2028 to major firms including Stellantis, LG Corp, Umicore and Glencore.

Speaking to Reuters, Francis Wedin, Executive Chair of Vulcan Energy, said construction was now fully funded and set to begin immediately. He confirmed the project would take two-and-a-half years with full-scale operations expected once commissioning is complete.

The project is supported by a multi-layered financing package of US$2.56bn combining equity grants and debt. The financing is backed by 13 institutions including the European Investment Bank, five export credit agencies and seven commercial banks.

Vulcan also received US$122m in grants from the German government.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/651eaccaa54a6bd8de66932329cf0e1e:988f64f10d705d4e6207ece09f1487d1/schleidberg-well-site-part-of-vulcan-energys-geothermal-operations-in-the-upper-rhine-valley-image-vulcan-energy.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:01:20.513166

WASHINGTON (P&GJ) — Environmental and consumer advocacy groups warned this week that continued growth in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports could drive higher energy costs for domestic consumers, citing new analysis and recent court action involving a proposed Louisiana export terminal.

During a media briefing, representatives from Sierra Club and Public Citizen pointed to a Louisiana state court decision that vacated a coastal use permit for Commonwealth LNG’s proposed export facility, as well as the state regulator’s subsequent reissuance of the permit. The briefing coincided with the release of a long-anticipated report from Public Citizen examining the inflationary impact of expanding LNG exports.

Eric Huber, managing attorney with Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said the court ruling hinged on a lack of environmental justice and climate analysis. “The judge vacated the Commonwealth permit because it didn’t consider environmental justice or climate change, but instead of a good faith effort to fix it, the state agency re-issued the same permit with no changes and no public participation, basically doubling down on its prior conclusions,” Huber said. “We are planning to file a new lawsuit as early as Thursday, December 18th.”

Opponents initially viewed the ruling as a setback for LNG expansion, but noted that Louisiana regulators moved quickly to reinstate the permit. Panelists also criticized what they described as broader federal support for LNG development, citing backing from the administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Department of Energy. In November, the U.S. House passed legislation aimed at limiting federal oversight of LNG expansion.

Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, argued that rising export volumes are already affecting domestic gas markets. “Eight LNG export terminals now consume more natural gas than all 74 million households with gas utility service,” Slocum said. “Twenty-five percent of all US gas production is now headed for export.”

Slocum added that export growth has translated into higher costs for consumers. “These record exports are causing an affordability crisis for American families,” he said. “American households have paid $12 billion in higher natural gas prices since Trump took office, amounting to $124 more per family.”

According to Public Citizen’s report, increasing LNG export volumes removes gas supply from the domestic market, contributing to higher prices for residential, commercial, and industrial users. The analysis also argues that higher gas prices could raise electricity costs, as gas-fired generation continues to account for a growing share of U.S. power supply.

Panelists concluded that while LNG export capacity continues to expand, policy and legal avenues remain available for communities seeking to limit or delay projects they believe could increase energy costs.

For the first time, New York explicitly evaluated nuclear power in its power system modeling and found that adding new nuclear energy would make it easier and less expensive for the state to meet its 2040 clean energy target.

With or without nuclear energy, the plan makes clear that there cannot be any excuses or delays in accelerating clean energy and storage deployment.
An effort to scale nuclear energy serves as a complement — not a substitute — for ambitious reforms that address near-term deployment barriers directly.","The New York State Energy Planning Board on Tuesday approved the latest State Energy Plan, a critical update to the roadmap guiding New York toward its nation-leading climate goals. Within the modeling undergirding it is an important finding. For the first time, New York explicitly evaluated nuclear power in its power system modeling and found that adding new nuclear energy would make it easier and less expensive for the state to meet its 2040 clean energy target.

This conclusion comes at a pivotal moment. The same modeling, conducted by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, acknowledges that New York is likely to miss its ambitious 2030 emissions reduction targets. While disappointing, the outcome reflects the scale of the challenge rather than a lack of effort. The state has reduced power-sector emissions by 43% from 1990 levels and launched crucial efforts including a Clean Energy Standard, siting and transmission reforms, the Coordinated Grid Planning Process, major offshore wind projects and the Build Public Renewables Act. The question now is whether the state will apply lessons from its own analysis as it looks ahead to 2040.

NYSERDA’s modeling makes a compelling case that nuclear power can deliver meaningful system-wide benefits. Across five scenarios and multiple variants that model different amounts of new nuclear that could be built by 2040 — anywhere from 2.2 GW to 4.4 GW — the cost-minimizing model consistently chose to max out new nuclear capacity built in New York. Even at the lower end, adding 2.2 GW of new nuclear power decreases the total costs of achieving the 2040 targets by an estimated $26 billion. That’s $26 billion saved from the pockets of ratepayers and taxpayers. It also significantly reduces the amount of infrastructure the state would need to build to achieve its targets, lowering the total required generation and storage capacity by about 11 GW by 2040 and 23 GW by 2050, which is equivalent to one-third and two-thirds of the peak demand in the state today, respectively.

These results may surprise some, as the technology’s levelized cost of electricity is higher compared to onshore wind or utility-scale solar. But NYSERDA’s assumptions about nuclear costs are relatively balanced, ranging from $11,600/kW to $12,400/kW up to 2035 with declining costs after. These assumptions are more conservative than a recent study by MIT that estimated lower new nuclear build costs. But what the levelized cost of energy metric does not capture is the value nuclear resources provide the electricity grid beyond the electricity they generate.

Nuclear energy’s large impact lies in its ability to provide zero-carbon, firm and dispatchable power. In a power system reliant mostly on intermittent renewable sources, nuclear’s ability to operate 24/7 can offset an outsized amount of other capacity. By building nuclear plants for baseload energy, we can forego building the most expensive, marginal intermittent resources for peak demand and focus on the fastest, least expensive renewables to pair with that nuclear baseload.

While new nuclear capacity reduces the total amount of capacity the state needs to build to achieve targets, the modeling in the state’s plans still underscores the need for renewables, storage and transmission to scale at warp speed. With or without nuclear energy, the plan makes clear that there cannot be any excuses or delays in accelerating clean energy and storage deployment. An effort to scale nuclear energy serves as a complement — not a substitute — for ambitious reforms that address near-term deployment barriers directly.

In fact, nuclear energy’s potential benefits are dependent on new transmission. In one scenario that developed 3.3 GW of new nuclear, 1 GW of additional transmission was needed from upstate to deliver the nuclear electrons to downstate load. This further underscores that transmission bottlenecks between upstate and downstate constrain New York under any mix of generating resources. Building this transmission capacity is critical for every viable decarbonization scenario.

Of course, running a power system model is relatively easy compared to scaling a new nuclear supply chain and overcoming nuclear financing challenges. While New York’s recent 1 GW goal and the development of a nuclear roadmap are a good start, more will be needed for the state to realize its vision. The state must quickly establish an energy program that will procure new nuclear — establishing mechanisms to manage project development risks, public financing mechanisms to lower the financial hurdles and interest costs, and leveraging its co-leadership in organizations like the National Association of State Energy Officials’ Advanced Nuclear First Movers Initiative for new nuclear development.

Ultimately, New York’s new energy plan sends an important signal: Deep decarbonization requires not just ambition, but technological inclusion. NYSERDA’s analysis clearly shows that nuclear energy can play a valuable role in the solution, and now state leaders must show the resolve to act on this and other lessons from the Energy Plan.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ceyBvnUEzllo2cVVtQ4Pqk8FQshk4nviVHxQdo0Wftc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjMyNjA5ODY3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-17 11:01:12.358397

This year, across the South, we worked together in the face of unprecedented attacks on our environment.

And while the challenges were daunting, something even stronger carried us forward: our shared commitment to make a difference here at home.

Alongside our supporters and partner organizations across the South we’ve worked together to protect the places we love, defend the communities too often overlooked, and safeguard the healthy environment every one of us depends on.

Together, we fought back against the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle our bedrock environmental protections, held polluters accountable, and worked to protect clean air, clean water, a stable climate, thriving wildlife, accessible public lands, and a healthier future.

With your support, we’re holding the line and even made progress as the White House paves the way for polluters. You were with us in the courtroom, in the halls of government, and in the communities we serve.

Taking on the Trump Administration

The Trump administration is doing everything they can to unravel the bedrock laws that keep our air breathable, our water safe to drink, and our public lands protected.

The consequence of this administration’s attempts to dismantle federal protections is being felt in our everyday lives. And over the past year, we stepped up because no one voted for dirty air or dirty water.

From filing litigation over funding to cuts for climate and environmental justice federal programs to organizing advocates to speak out on gutting safeguards for public lands, we stood up together and pushed back against the threats against our environment.

Safeguarding the waters we rely on

Clean water is one of our region’s most essential resources.

This year further demonstrated just how quickly it can be put at risk. Communities across the South are facing dangerous threats to their drinking water, from toxic industrial chemicals to leaking coal ash pits and outdated infrastructure that jeopardizes the health of our families. But when our clean water is threatened, people respond. And we are working with them.

Across the region, residents, local partners, and advocacy groups are demanding transparency, accountability, and stronger protections for our rivers, lakes, and the drinking water sources they rely on every day.

That was especially clear from North Carolina, where 900,000 downstream residents learned their drinking water was being contaminated by a cancer-causing industrial chemical from the town of Asheboro. And from Alabama where SELC secured a settlement to help address Tuscaloosa’s chronic sewage spills into Hurricane Creek.

Plantations to Pollution: confronting history, protecting communities

History isn’t behind us; it’s under our feet.

This year, SELC deepened its work to connect the South’s past to the pollution and policy failures still harming communities today. With more than 100 active environmental justice matters, our attorneys and advocates are enforcing the laws that safeguard clean air and water for communities of color across the region. Through Plantations to Pollution: Black Communities, Legacy Pollution, and the Path Forward, we traced the often-unbroken line from plantation slavery to modern environmental injustices — while spotlighting the people demanding fairness, accountability, and a healthier future. Because what was built on injustice still demands justice.

Communities leading the way for clean air

Communities across the South need clean air. This year, we deepened our work alongside residents, partner organizations, and local leaders to strengthen air protections at a time when state and federal oversight is increasingly strained. From training community members in Birmingham to identify and report air pollution to confronting new threats from rapidly expanding industries like data centers and landfills that could worsen air quality for already overburdened communities.

While the Trump administration is granting exemptions for some of our country’s most dangerous air polluters, SELC continues to push for transparency, enforce the Clean Air Act, and demand that decision-makers evaluate the health and economic consequences of pollution.

While the federal government may try to erase any mention of environmental justice, it cannot silence the voices of those living with the impacts.

Listen to the latest season of the Broken Ground podcast to hear more of the story.

Defending our climate future

Climate change continues to intensify across the South, but this year showed the strength of communities working to build a healthier, more resilient future. In rural Virginia, residents successfully stopped a massive methane gas plant proposed to fuel a sprawling data center complex. This is a clear reminder that local voices can shape the region’s energy future. We also challenged the Trump administration’s attempt to halt funding for electric vehicle infrastructure which would stall critical progress need to shift drivers toward cleaner options.

Across the region, we pushed for policies that address the South’s high energy burden, ensuring families aren’t forced to choose between keeping the lights on and meeting basic needs. And along the Gulf, we stood with local residents and commercial fishermen facing the rising impacts of the methane export boom that is having devastating impacts on these coastal communities’ health, livelihoods, and culture.

Protecting the wild places and wildlife we love

The South’s public lands and wildlife are among our region’s greatest treasures, and this year brought important progress toward safeguarding the places and species that define us.

In South Carolina, we helped protect an ancient swamp forest from a proposed power line expansion that would have cut through one of the state’s most ecologically significant landscapes. Along the coast, we secured protections for the fragile bird sanctuary at Lake Mattamuskeet, stopping a toxic chemical experiment that could have threatened migratory birds and the surrounding ecosystem.

Red wolves, the most endangered population in the world, saw renewed momentum after years of decline, thanks to ongoing legal pressure and strengthened commitments to recovery. And in Georgia, the Okefenokee Swamp took a major step toward lasting protection, marking a turning point for one of the South’s most iconic wild places.

A hopeful close to a hard year.

This year tested our environment, our region, and many of us personally. Yet through every challenge, one truth held steady: When we work together, we make progress.

You proved that it is possible even in the toughest of times. You reminded us that hope isn’t something we simply feel — it’s something we do. Hope is filing suit when communities and places are threatened. It’s showing up to public hearings. It’s supporting our work financially and through advocacy, refusing to accept that pollution is inevitable or acceptable.

Thank you for working with us. For believing in a better future for the South and taking action, day after day, to make it real. Thank you for working alongside us. Thank you for believing in the power and promise of this place and our organization.

At SELC, we say: Solutions start in the South. This year, you proved once again—they start with you.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-599412855-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 11:02:26.841511

For immediate expensing of research and experimental expenditures under § 174A, Federal Tax Coordinator 2d ¶ L-3075.","Baker Tilly experts outlined key tax strategies for individuals and businesses navigating changes enacted by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Panelists at a December 11 webinar hosted by the firm offered advice on strategic planning, compliance, and financial modeling in the wake of the new law, which permanently extended several existing provisions while introducing new credits and deductions.

Enacted in July 2025, the OBBBA makes many of the individual and business tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent, preventing a scheduled reversion to higher pre-TCJA rates.

For businesses, the Act restores and makes permanent several key provisions, most notably the immediate expensing for domestic research and experimental (R&E) expenditures and 100% bonus depreciation. However, the legislation also scales back some of the clean energy incentives established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), especially for wind and solar projects.

Proactive Strategic Planning

The Baker Tilly panel, comprised of experts in the firm’s credits and incentives and financial advisory practices, emphasized that taxpayers must engage in early and comprehensive strategic planning to maximize benefits. This is especially true for state and local incentives, which often require action before a project is publicly announced.

Director Gabriel Sermeno noted that businesses considering relocating a facility to a different state can trigger several incentives, such as those for “new equipment, new buildings,” and “infrastructure improvement.” But companies should allot “at least three” months “at the bare minimum, if not six or more” for reaching out to states as part of a thorough location analysis.

“It’s important to get ahead of that and make sure that we’re not calling them the day before we’re going to put a shovel in the ground, because they’re going to be less inclined to provide incentives to a project that they feel has already made a decision,” Sermeno said. He advised creating an internal project team with representatives from finance, tax, human resources, and the C-suite, to ensure incentive eligibility.

This proactive stance is also critical for federal credits. Senior Manager Colin Quill reminded taxpayers of the tight timelines for new clean energy credits. Phaseouts of solar and wind credits in particular were “really accelerated, he explained,” as developers “have to begin construction … before July 4, 2026.” Facilities should be placed in service by January 1, 2028.

For businesses involved in manufacturing, Managing Director Jarrid McAuliff recommended planning around the new qualified production property (QPP) rules, which allow for accelerated depreciation. “[P]roperty that would otherwise be required to be depreciated over 39 years for tax purposes could be fully expensed in Year One, to the extent that it is integral and directly related to manufacturing or production process that meets certain requirements,” McAuliff stated.

He cautioned, however, that this “integral part test” specifically excludes ancillary areas like offices, restrooms, and lobbies.

Compliance Risks

With new opportunities come new compliance risks, and the panel warned that the IRS is increasing its enforcement efforts. The transferability of federal tax credits, a feature of the recent IRA and modified by the new law, is a key concern. Quill warned that while the IRS registration portal verifies a project’s existence, there is no “certification by the IRS as to the value of the credits or the amount,” meaning “there’s still that audit risk on the back end after you transfer them and then claim.”

This risk is compounded by new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules. Quill affirmed that taxpayers should “go down your supply chain [and] look at where your manufacturing material is coming from.”

“If it’s coming from an entity that’s directly tied to China, North Korea, Russia or Iran, that’s an issue,” which “could cause you to not get a credit at all,” Quill added.

Thorough documentation is the primary defense, the panel emphasized. For businesses claiming QPP expensing, McAuliff recommended conducting an “engineering-based cost segregation study to safely identify those parts of the building, components of the building, that are deemed integral and necessary for the production process.”

Modeling State and Federal Impacts

The experts advised that taxpayers must model the financial impact of various state and federal incentives to optimize their tax strategy. Managing Director Brad Elmer shared a case study of a $35 million historic redevelopment project in Kansas City where a holistic approach yielded substantial benefits.

“About half of it was financed through some type of credit or incentive,” he said, citing a combination of federal and state historic tax credits, a state brownfield credit, new markets tax credits, and a local property tax abatement. But he cautioned that the value of incentives varies by jurisdiction and timing, making detailed financial modeling crucial.

The interplay between federal and state rules also requires careful analysis, the panel agreed. Discussing the new rules for IRC § 174A, which allows for immediate expensing of domestic R&E, Director Diana Walker observed that not all states conform to the federal changes.

“[Y]ou also need to look into that and see what impact you could have there,” Walker advised. “For some states, you may still need to do [IRC § 174] analysis on the domestic side.”

Small businesses “should gather your documentation to support that you meet the requirement to be considered a small business under the OBBBA,” she continued. “And finally, make sure that you get with your tax advisor and plan for your return.”

The funds include an approved loan of $347 million from the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program and selection of Fort Worth to receive $4,817,344 million from the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) grant program.

Fort Worth’s WIFIA loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse. A newly designed and built water reclamation facility will meet the needs of a growing population while treating wastewater to be reused for industrial and irrigation purposes. The SWIFR grant will help launch the Reuse Program and Recycling Enhancement Project to collect appliances, building materials, furniture, and electronics for reuse at drop-off locations.

Fort Worth’s WIFIA loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse

“Fort Worth’s growth has made it a premier destination in Texas for families and businesses, and has created a greater need for clean water infrastructure and materials management services,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “Funding from EPA can help this great city increase capacity to meet those needs and continue the historic pace of growth.”

“Fort Worth is committed to making smart, future-focused investments that keep our city strong and affordable for the families and businesses who call it home,” said Mayor Mattie Parker. “The EPA’s WIFIA loan for the Mary’s Creek Water Reclamation Facility allows us to stretch every dollar by securing low interest rates and flexible repayment terms. The solid waste grant helps us expand the reuse and recycling services our community relies on. Together, these investments are a major win for our wastewater and solid waste ratepayers and reinforce our commitment to delivering high-quality, cost-effective services as Fort Worth continues to grow.”

The WIFIA program aims to accelerate investment in the nation’s water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental credit assistance for regionally and nationally significant projects. Through its flexible financing features and competitive interest rates, WIFIA helps communities save money. By pairing the WIFIA program’s federal funding with state, local, and private investment, EPA accelerates water infrastructure investment worth billions of dollars.

The WIFIA program’s rolling selection process allows a wide variety of borrowers from across the country to access WIFIA financing. For example, in the last round of funding, the WIFIA program selected two private entities and five small communities to submit loan applications. To date, EPA’s WIFIA program has announced $22 billion to help finance over 140 projects across the country. These projects are creating over 160,000 jobs across the country.

EPA’s SWIFR program provides grants to improve post-consumer materials management and infrastructure; support improvements to local post-consumer materials management and recycling programs; and assist local waste management authorities in making improvements to local waste management systems.

From apples to grapes, MSU research covered the full beverage aisle this year.","From a new presidential administration and consequential tariffs to devastating wildfires and a new comet, to pop culture news and continued international conflict, faculty experts at Michigan State University offered thoughtful, research-based commentary to provide insight and context on these events.

MSU researchers continued to make breakthroughs and discoveries this year despite unprecedented federal research terminations, which present major implications to both Americans and people across the world.

As Michigan State University ranked as a top 50 global research university this year, the institution is often featured in the media for its research prowess, major discoveries and scientific breakthroughs. MSU faculty prioritize engaging media with the goal of advancing public knowledge and fact-sharing to support more informed decision-making and policy funding, as well as to combat misinformation and disinformation, both of which are on the rise.

Take a look at some of our top research and story placements as well as expert commentary in national, statewide and local media throughout 2025.

2025: When politics overpowered science

In 2025, the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, initiative became one of the year’s most contentious public health stories as federal leaders reshaped the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and rolled back established vaccine guidance while researchers warned that these changes frequently relied on flawed or nonexistent science. Even highly visible actions like phasing out synthetic food dyes drew criticism for lacking scientific rigor and relying on voluntary compliance.

When the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a $500 million budget cut for the research and production of vaccines based on mRNA technologies and changed its vaccine guidelines, MSU’s Rebecca Schein, a pediatric infectious disease physician in the College of Human Medicine, shared her knowledge about what people should know and how to prepare for these changes. Schein spoke with several media outlets, including writing an article about measles in The Conversation.

But the biggest shock to the scientific community came when the National Institutes of Health announced sweeping cuts to major grant programs — reductions that significantly impacted universities, hospitals and research institutes nationwide. Long-standing projects in cancer, neuroscience, infectious disease, maternal health and environmental health all saw sudden freezes or eliminations, leaving scientists scrambling to maintain labs, staff and clinical studies.

At MSU, faculty raised alarms about the immediate fallout: paused trials, disrupted student training pipelines and delays in life-saving research. Experts emphasized that these cuts don’t just affect universities — they slow medical progress, weaken the national research workforce and ultimately impact patients who rely on new diagnostics, treatments and public health breakthroughs.

Dawn Misra, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the College of Human Medicine, was halfway through a study on infant mortality among Detroit mothers when it was canceled and shared her experience with The New Yorker and The Detroit News.

Cara Poland, associate professor at the College of Human Medicine, who runs a drug treatment clinic, testified about the drastic cuts to opioid prevention. Other scholars, such as Red Cedar Distinguished Professor Natoshia Cunningham, authored op-eds about how the impact of program cuts, even abroad, will negatively affect Americans.

Jeffrey MacKeigan, a professor at the College of Human Medicine, submitted an article to The Conversation about how there is literally no replacement for government-funded cancer research.

But while national health policy drifted toward ideology, MSU’s faculty members have remained committed to providing public health guidance grounded in data and science-based breakthroughs like the research that led to the discovery of cisplatin, which continues to save lives after nearly 50 years.

One of MSU’s most celebrated moments in 2025 was the national recognition of cisplatin — the groundbreaking cancer drug discovered through MSU-led research. In 1965, a group of Michigan State University researchers discovered it while working on an unrelated chemistry project. Since then, cisplatin has become the industry standard for cancer-fighting chemotherapy treatments. In September 2025, MSU received a Golden Goose Award for the scientific success and global impact of cisplatin. The Golden Goose Award is meant to highlight the practical value of curiosity-driven research. The idea is that fundamental research can lead to unexpected, but profound, societal benefits.

Cancer is everywhere, unfortunately. From understanding the origins of cancer to engineering precision therapies, MSU scientists continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the fight against this disease. In September 2025, researchers at Michigan State University unveiled an innovative hydrogel with the consistency of shampoo that may help protect hair from falling out during chemotherapy. Designed to be applied before and kept on during treatment, the gel offers a potentially accessible, lower-impact approach to preserving patients’ appearance and dignity in what is often a difficult time.

In January, MSU Research Foundation Professor Teresa Woodruff joined one of the most exclusive circles in American science when former President Joe Biden awarded her the National Medal of Science — the nation’s highest honor for scientific achievement. Woodruff, the first Spartan ever to receive the medal, was recognized for groundbreaking contributions to reproductive biology, cancer research and the creation of an entirely new scientific field: oncofertility, which bridges oncology and reproductive health. As MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz said, “Her oncofertility research has given thousands of patients and their families hope for a better future.”

At MSU, we know that funding and research leads to ongoing discoveries. In 2020, Aitor Aguirre, associate professor and chief of the Division of Developmental and Stem Cell Biology in MSU’s Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering and his team started creating and perfecting tiny working models of the human heart known as organoids. His lab is now a pioneer and world leader in human heart organoid technologies. These organoids are truly mini hearts, complete with chamber-like structures and vascular networks including arteries, veins and capillaries. The team’s most recent development was to modify the organoids to replicate atrial fibrillation, or A-fib. This development will benefit an estimated 60 million people who have arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats. No new drugs have been introduced for this condition for more than 30 years because accurate models have not been available.

To solve real health problems like A-fib and strengthen Michigan’s leadership in science, health care and education, MSU will continue to look forward and prepare for what’s next. In 2025, MSU began to evaluate “One Team, One Health,” a major institutional shift that would integrate human, animal and environmental health in a way that would position MSU as a national leader. This new vision would benefit our students and the people of Michigan and beyond.

And in 2025, the College of Osteopathic Medicine celebrated an important milestone: becoming the first osteopathic medical school to be included in the prestigious National Institutes of Health Medical Scientist Training Program, or MSTP. This award officially recognizes MSU’s D.O.-Ph.D. Physician-Scientist Training Program as one of the top dual-degree programs in the U.S., elevating its influence in the biomedical research community. The MSTP is one of the most competitive medical education programs and provides funding and support for students pursuing dual medical and research degrees.

Tariffs hit ports and purses

From global markets to the grocery store, tariffs reshaped economic policy and conversation. The Trump administration announced “Liberation Day” on April 2, 2025, after imposing record-high global tariffs — importing controversy and exporting heated debate.

Jason Miller, Eli Broad Professor in Supply Chain Management at the Broad College of Business, not only published research on tariffs, but spoke with dozens of media, including ABC News, Bloomberg and Marketplace. These engagements helped land Miller to the state’s Commission for Logistics and Supply Chain Collaboration. As tariffs tested reactions, it tested legal questions. So Matthew Leffler, an adjunct professor at the MSU College of Law, commented about the legal debate amid the Supreme Court case, V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump.

Ports were not just affected but our pantries too. David Ortega, professor and Noel W. Stuckman Chair in Food Economics and Policy at the College of Agricultural and Natural Resources, discussed the impact on food prices and agriculture. Ortega was a key resource to localize the issue while being a go-to expert for numerous national outlets, including PBS, CBS and Reuters, to name a few. All this public engagement led Ortega to receive an award for his research communication in food economics and the opportunity to testify to lawmakers.

Beyond prices, the issue of tariffs created uncertainty about the overall impact to the economy. Reacting were Associate Professor Antonio Doblas-Madrid and Professor Emeritus Charles Ballard, economists at the College of Social Science, who discussed the impact to investments and how tariffs affected interest rates, respectively.

Stellar interstellar research and activity

Is it a bird? A plane? No, it’s the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS! And MSU’s own Darryl Seligman was on the team that discovered it and authored the first scientific paper on the icy traveler. It’s named 3I because it’s only the third interstellar object to enter our solar system. And ATLAS stands for NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, which consists of four telescopes — two in Hawaii, one in Chile and one in South Africa — that automatically scan the entire sky several times every night looking for moving objects. Seligman, assistant professor in the College of Natural Science, talked to media outlets around the globe, including NPR, CNN and the BBC, reaching over 1,000 articles since 3I/ATLAS was first discovered.

And a rare “planet parade” occurred Feb. 28, 2025, when seven planets — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — lined up in the night sky, offering a spectacular opportunity for sky watchers. MSU’s Shannon Schmoll, manager of MSU’s Abrams Planetarium, served as one of MSU’s most visible national experts, appearing in outlets like Newsweek and the Associated Press, discussing everything from planetary alignments to supermoons. She reached audiences across the country and reinforced MSU’s leadership in astronomy education and public science outreach.

When a black hole winks at you, should you wink back? Stephen DiKerby, a physics and astronomy research associate in the College of Natural Science, detected a rare X-ray “wink” from the supermassive black hole at the center of the Andromeda galaxy using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. By analyzing 15 years of telescope data, DiKerby and his collaborators uncovered previously unseen flares that shed new light on how galaxies and their black holes evolve. The discovery, published in The Astrophysical Journal and linked to ongoing neutrino research through the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, highlights the importance of sustaining high-resolution space telescopes like Chandra, which are critical tools for understanding the physics that shape our universe. Wink, wink!

Climate change: Turning up the heat and haze

It was another scorcher of a year, with expectations of 2025 coming in as the second or third hottest year on record. As temperatures climbed, so did conversations about all things weather. Discussing climate change was Wolfgang Bauer, University Distinguished Professor at the College of Natural Science, speaking with MSUToday and Yahoo. Tackling the big question of what can be done, Jeremy Orr, an adjunct professor at the College of Law, offered his insights in Crain’s Detroit Business.

The year was not just hot, it caught fire. The Palisades Fire blazed for weeks, becoming the most destructive wildfire in the history of Los Angeles. And the smoke in the west didn’t stay there. Michigan experienced fire-related haze from Canada, raising concerns about air quality for households, pets and wildlife alike. So, Robert Wahl, assistant professor at the College of Human Medicine, spoke to The New York Times and stations here in Michigan about how to mitigate health risk. To extinguish confusion, Chad Papa, director of the Forest Carbon and Climate Program, shed light on why fires occur to Bridge Michigan and the Detroit Free Press.

Another kind of fire started simmering, but underground: Mount Spur, a giant volcano in Alaska. The monitoring alerts went out on the heels of funding cuts. Professor Jeffrey Freymueller, professor and chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the College of Natural Science, spoke about the importance of geographic monitoring with CNN and The New York Times.

To cool things off, Michigan with its many miles of Great Lakes shoreline, saw water levels peak in 2020. As a result, Assistant Professor Ethan Theuerkauf at the College of Social Science has been studying the increase of shoreline protection efforts and environmental impacts and shared his findings with various outlets.

The year of the animals

This year was so full of creatures great and small that MSU practically needed its own ark. From fungi-loving dogs to butterflies on the brink, from cows moo-ving into their new digs, bees making headlines and veterinarians containing an avian flu outbreak — animals were at the center of some of MSU’s most meaningful stories.

In January, Gregory Bonito discovered two new species of truffles with some paw-fessional help by “truffle dogs.” Tuber canirevelatum, meaning the ‘dog-found’ truffle, was named in honor of all truffle dogs and Monza, the dog who discovered it with her trainer Lois Martin. The other, Tuber cumberlandense, was named for the Cumberland Plateau where it was found by Margaret Townsend and her truffle dog, Luca. Even fungi experts said the find provided mush-room for excitement. Food & Wine, Popular Science along with other outlets covered the story.

In July, MSU officially opened its massive new Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center, welcoming the first wave of cows into a facility designed to support cutting-edge animal science and student learning. At 165,000 square feet, the center gives dairy research space to grow — no more feeling udder-ly cramped. The transition from the 1960s barns to a modern operation signaled a major investment in animal welfare, agriculture and Michigan’s dairy future. The Associated Press was on hand to capture the story, which led to several other media hits as well.

In 2025, Maple, a retired police K-9, became one of MSU’s most unexpected research partners. At the Pollinator Performance Center, Maple helped demonstrate how trained dogs can quickly sniff out American foulbrood, a highly contagious disease that can devastate honeybee colonies if it goes undetected. The project highlights MSU’s creative, cross-disciplinary approach to protecting pollinators, strengthening agriculture and supporting beekeepers — all while reminding campus that sometimes big science breakthroughs come with wagging tails and a bee suit. The Associated Press, The Washington Post and several other outlets reported on Maple and MSU’s research partnership.

On a more serious note, a March study by MSU scientists raised the alarm that some countries could face the unthinkable: losing all native butterfly species if habitat loss and climate stress continue unchecked. The research, led by Elise Zipkin, director of MSU’s Ecology, Evolution and Behavior Program, and her MSU colleague and co-author Nick Haddad, professor of integrative biology in EEB, have been major figures in assessing the state of U.S. butterflies and highlighting the urgent need for conservation and better land-use protections before ecosystems reach a breaking point. In 2025, this study was catapulted into national conversation as a stark example of what is at stake as outlined in this article by The New York Times. Many other national outlets covered this startling news, including The Washington Post, Associated Press and Science Friday.

One of the year’s most significant stories was Michigan State University’s leadership in the national response to highly pathogenic avian influenza after the virus made an unprecedented jump into U.S. dairy cattle. With years of preparation already underway, MSU’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory — led at the time by Kimberly Dodd, who is now dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine — became one of the first labs in the country to detect the virus in milk and develop new diagnostic methods. In partnership with state and federal agencies, MSU helped launch the National Milk Testing Strategy, giving farmers and regulators an early-warning system that shaped the country’s response. MSU researchers and veterinarians were on farms within days collecting samples, guiding biosecurity and providing critical, science-based information to producers.

Their findings, including how long cattle shed the virus, how it affects milk production and why milk is the best sample for detection, informed national policy and helped Michigan become a model for rapid, coordinated response. As Dodd put it, the goal is to “detect the next COVID before it becomes a pandemic.” With the virus still circulating in wild birds, MSU scientists continue to track risks and support farmers, proving that when a threat won’t quit, neither will the teams working to stay ahead of it. The ABC News Medical Unit came to campus to help tell this important story.

Agriculture is in our DNA

MSU was founded as a pioneer agricultural college and has evolved over the last 170 years into a major land-grant research university devoted to agriculture, natural resources and beyond. Here’s some of our top agriculture research in 2025.

MSU researcher John A. Hannah Distinguished Professor Bruno Basso and his team made a big leap forward this year by improving how carbon markets work — systems that pay farmers and companies for practices that genuinely reduce greenhouse gases. The challenge is that these markets only work if the climate benefits are measured accurately, and most current methods rely on outdated assumptions. Basso’s group developed a new, science-backed way to show what would happen on farmland without any changes, making it much easier to tell whether practices like no-till or cover crops are truly helping the climate. Tested across 12 Midwestern states, the approach is simple enough to scale and gives farmers and businesses a clearer, more trustworthy foundation for investing in regenerative agriculture. Why does this matter? It helps ensure climate solutions are real and that farmers get credit for the work that actually makes a difference. This important story was covered in The New York Times.

Agriculture in space? Narendra Das, an associate professor in MSU’s College of Engineering, helped build a new tool for space, and farms here on Earth will benefit too. When the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar mission launched July 30, 2025, it carried MSU-developed technology that can map soil moisture from space at a fine scale (about 100–200 meters). That means farmers in Michigan, across the U.S. and around the world will be able to get up-to-date information on fields — even under clouds or at night — to help them decide when to plant, irrigate or harvest. The data could improve crop yields, boost food security and even help monitor drought or wildfire risk. MSU’s contribution puts farmer-friendly Earth science on the global radar. Media found this story out of this world.

And while MSU technology was soaring into space, MSU researchers Ben Belton, professor in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Leo Baldiga, a doctoral student in the College of Social Science, were helping transform what happens just a few feet above the ground. Modern agricultural drones that are now powerful enough to carry heavy loads like two sacks of fertilizer can also spray crops, plant seeds, map fields, monitor crop health and even help tend livestock. For farms large and small, that means more efficiency, less manual labor and far smarter, more precise farming. Together, MSU’s space-based sensors and down-to-earth drones show how the university is helping agriculture take off in every direction and the media liked the story.

And as drones were transforming how farmers work from the sky, MSU’s Anthony Kendall, an assistant professor in the College of Natural Science, was testing how solar panels on farmland could improve soil health, save water and support pollinators — all while giving farmers a new, steady income stream. Kendall’s team is using a $3.6 million National Science Foundation grant to build a first-of-its-kind outdoor lab to study how solar arrays interact with crops, groundwater and local ecosystems. The goal is to give farmers and communities clear, science-based guidance on when solar makes sense. Just yet another reason why funding research matters. Several media outlets picked up this bright story including Michigan Public radio.

Not all farm innovation comes from space or solar panels — some of it starts right in the barn. In October 2025, MSU research helped a Michigan dairy farm improve milk quality and cut feed costs by switching cows to a high-oleic soybean diet developed at MSU. The change boosted milk fat and protein while reducing the farm’s purchased feed expenses by about 20% each month. Why this matters: It shows how MSU science can strengthen farm profitability and sustainability at the same time, a subject of interest to various media outlets including Michigan Farm News.

Now here’s something to raise a glass to. From apples to grapes, MSU research covered the full beverage aisle this year. In vineyards across Michigan, Associate Professor Timothy Miles helped growers protect the state’s $6 billion grape industry by identifying the viruses that quietly drain yields — a big win for anyone who enjoys Michigan juice or wine, and the media agreed.

Meanwhile, deep in the woods, Professor Steve van Nocker and doctoral student Kaz Christian tracked down the last wild apple trees in Michigan, preserving rare genetics that could make future orchards more frost-tolerant. Together, MSU scientists kept the state’s fruit — and its cider, juice and wine — flowing smoothly. The Associated Press followed us in the woods for this story and other media reported on it as well.

AI, engineering and innovation

When the nation’s infrastructure made headlines, MSU experts made solutions. The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after being struck from a ship that lost signal. In response to safety concerns, Nizar Lajnef, professor at the College of Engineering, combined sensors and artificial intelligence to assess the health of infrastructure from bridges to dams to roads. He shared how this technology is going to benefit infrastructure in Michigan, including the Mackinac Bridge.

When discussing infrastructure innovation, it would be remiss not to bring up concrete. And speaking of concrete, did you know that it can bend and heal now? At least, it does at MSU. Assistant Professor Qingxu “Bill” Jin at the College of Engineering worked with his team to develop slabs of self-heating and self-healing concrete to improve road safety. Jin shared the success with almost every outlet in the state from Detroit to Grand Rapids to northern Michigan.

As physical innovations occurred, MSU researchers also examined digital innovation and AI running alongside it. Mohammad Ghassemi, assistant professor at the College of Education, discussed the reliability of AI, while David Markowitz, associate professor at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences, was not lying when it came to a study examining whether or not AI can detect lying. As conversations turned to regulation, Anjana Susarla, Omura-Saxena Professor in Responsible AI at the Broad College of Business, authored many commentaries in Forbes about policy and AI oversight.

The year in pop culture and sports

From the field to the screen, pop culture and sports took center stage. The Kansas City Chiefs came short of a historic three-peat Super Bowl. As the football slipped through hands, eyes shifted to the ads. Robert Kolt, professor of practice emeritus at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences, shared which ads scored and which ones missed, speaking with The State News and The Detroit News. Kendrick Lamar’s halftime performance, which set a record for most halftime viewers, stole the show. Analyzing how he struck a chord, Christina L. Myers, assistant professor at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences, shared her expertise in an article for The Conversation and in an interview about Lamar’s social and cultural impact.

Though Travis Kelce didn’t get another Super Bowl ring, he still managed to get another type of ring — an engagement ring for Taylor Swift, sending fans into a frenzy. The buzz did not remain online. Emily Muhich, assistant professor at the College of Social Science, took Taylor Swift to the classroom to teach concepts about pop culture, history and politics, which garnered media interest across mid-Michigan.

While Taylor Swift started in country music, Beyonce’s acclaimed country album and tour got fans talking in 2025, including the emergence of her daughter, Blue Ivy, as a burgeoning performer. Kinitra Brooks, professor and Leslie Endowed Chair in Literary Studies at the College of Arts and Letters, spoke to the Associated Press about her significance.

Fan bases also cheered on their sports teams. As the NFL saw many injuries this year, MSU President and John A. Hannah Distinguished Professor Kevin Guskiewicz discussed his concussion research and Matthew Harkey, assistant professor at the College of Education, shared research about how wireless ultrasounds can support on-field injuries.

Looking ahead to 2026, a different game of football got the world talking: the World Cup. MSU researchers are growing the grass for the competition’s 16 sites — and even launched a website ahead of the tournament. The team is led by Professor Trey Rogers at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, who has shared the success of the grassroots program with Michigan Farm News and outlets across the nation.

Diplomacy is not always diplomatic

Across borders and regions, tensions ensued throughout the year. October 7 marked two years since the Israel-Hamas conflict entered a new phase war. The release of the living hostages brought some resolution; however, stability in the region remains fragile. Russell Lucas, professor at James Madison College, not only discussed U.S. involvement but commented on the future of the Middle East to both U.S. think tanks and international media.

To the north, across the Black Sea, Russia’s war on Ukraine dragged on as the United States tried to be the peace broker. In reaction, Matthew Pauly, associate professor at the College of Social Science, spoke to Newsweek. At MSU’s campus, Pauly brought Ukrainian Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence Kseniia Borodin to teach students about Ukrainian language and history.

Geopolitical tensions also arose in unexpected places, such as Greenland, home to under 60,000 residents. However, the country occupied the headlines after President Trump floated the idea of annexation to the U.S., sparking strong reactions. Matt Zierler, associate professor at James Madison College, spoke with TheHill on the impact to global relations, while also commenting on the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico with Business Insider.

Immigration policy in the U.S. affected neighboring country relations and became a contentious issue as border security and deportations ramped up. Amid changing policies, Veronica Thronson, clinical professor of law and director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the MSU College of Law, commented on the executive orders and how the deportations could affect the workforce.

Touring Michigan the Spartan way

In May, MSU’s Spartan Bus Tour rolled through Detroit offering faculty and administrators a powerful two-day look at the city’s resilience, creativity and partnerships with the university. President Kevin Guskiewicz joined 60 Spartans at 14 stops across the region, including the Zekelman Holocaust Center, MSU Extension’s urban agriculture hub in northwest Detroit, neighborhood arts spaces, the Apple Developer Academy and the iconic Motown Museum. The stops highlighted how MSU’s work in education, health, mobility, the arts and economic development is deeply woven into Detroit’s story. Participants described the experience as inspiring and eye-opening, underscoring both the challenges Detroit faces and the innovation and strength that define the city today, as well as MSU’s responsibility to be a true partner in its continued growth. And the media, including WDET and the Michigan Chronicle, enjoyed the tour as well.

Then in October, a new group of MSU faculty and administrators traveled more than 1,100 miles across northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula on the fall Spartan Bus Tour — a rolling classroom designed to strengthen partnerships and spotlight MSU’s statewide impact. Over three days and 15 community stops, participants met with local leaders, health providers, artists, educators, tribal partners, researchers and alumni to learn firsthand how MSU’s work in rural health care, sustainable forestry, agriculture, education and economic development supports the region. From visiting community hospitals and wild rice restoration sites to touring maple syrup operations, mines, sports flooring manufacturers and local colleges, the tour emphasized MSU’s land-grant commitment to service, collaboration and listening. And UP media tagged along, as well, including to catch a surprise appearance by MSU basketball Head Coach Tom Izzo. As President Guskiewicz put it, after miles of meeting Michiganders where they are: “We have a responsibility as Michigan’s state university to serve its people through the work that we do at MSU. Times are tough, but we are Spartans — and we are built for this.”

Did you think we forgot about the Trump administration this year?

Since taking office this past January, the Trump administration has dominated the news — so we thought we would save it for last. You’re welcome. Within minutes after inauguration, President Trump signed over two dozen executive orders — and the actions did not stop. Matt Grossmann, professor at the College of Social Science, who was named a Carnegie Fellow in 2025, immediately began reacting to the orders and Trump’s first 100 days in office.

Trump’s actions prompted debate about executive power. Erica Frantz, associate professor at the College of Social Science, wrote an article for The Conversation and Jordan Cash, assistant professor at James Madison College was a frequent commentor. As the political climate intensified, the nation was stunned by political assassinations of elected officials and Charlie Kirk. Frantz spoke about the rise in political violence with Politico and the Wall Street Journal.

Despite it not being a general election year, there was still campaign buzz. Meghan Wilson, assistant professor at the College of Social Science, commented about the Detroit mayoral race with Michigan Public radio and authored articles on issues the city faces.

Other states held key gubernatorial and special elections, providing a first glimpse of 2026. Corwin Smidt, associate professor and interim director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, spoke about key issues such as health care to NPR and he previewed the major 2026 races in Michigan. Voters were also surveyed, including by Dante Chinni, director of the American Communities Project housed at the School of Journalism, who shared findings with The Associated Press.

What the Trump administration labeled as its government efficiency effort led to the loss of millions in research funding — including at MSU — and the university launched a Research for You campaign to show the value of funding research. In response, many faculty underscored the consequences to lost or revoked funding.

The federal government cut millions in USAID funding, resulting in losses for agricultural research. Dave Douches, professor at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, lost millions amid his research to engineer better potatoes to support food security, sharing the impact with MLive and CBS Detroit. Also from the college commenting about farm research loss was Professor David Tschirley, who spoke with Reuters and Fast Company, among other national outlets.

USAID cuts also affected public health. Robin Lin Miller, professor at the College of Social Science, authored pieces in The Detroit News and The Conversation on the U.S. retreat from trying to mitigate AIDS and HIV in Africa. These cuts also defunded education and engineering programs.

Researchers also discussed the impact of other federal programs and grant cancelations. Josh Cowen, professor at the College of Education, wrote many articles for The Conversation about Department of Education layoffs. Arts and humanities were affected too. Devon Akmon, director of the MSU Museum, wrote an article about the funding cuts to libraries and museums, and many researchers at MSU’s College of Arts and Letters shared the impact of their projects’ terminations.

To our surprise, some of these big issues found their way to the court room. One issue that could not scroll past the courts was the future of TikTok. Nancy Costello, clinical professor of law and director of the First Amendment Clinic, spoke with News Desk and Detroit media and continued to react to political speech issues.

Commenting on other Supreme Court cases were College of Law experts such as Frank Ravitch, professor of law and Walter H. Stowers Chair of Law and Religion, discussing cases on religion and schools with USA Today and Michigan Advance. There also were major cases on LGBTQ freedoms, so Heather Johnson, an adjunct professor of law, spoke with Bloomberg Law and localized the issues talking with Michigan stations.

But there were more legal woes. President Trump floated a potential third term, immediately raising constitutional questions. Brian Kalt, professor of law and Harold Norris Faculty Scholar, was everywhere commenting, not just on national television but in The Atlantic and The Hill. Pardon another topic, but presidential pardons also became a big issue. Not only was Kalt commenting, but also Quinn Yeargain, associate and 1855 Professor of the Law on Democracy, sitting down with PBS Detroit. Ahead of the midterms, redistricting battles began out of Texas, and Yeargain spoke with CNN. So, was this enough about politics?

The Trump administration may have dominated the news — but MSU experts dominated the reactions — providing research and fact-based explanation and insights.

Volkswagen AG and Rivian Automotive Inc. have ambitions of selling the electric vehicle technology they’re developing together to other carmakers in the future.

Their joint venture, known as RV Tech, said it has made solid progress on delivering the EV electrical and software platform that Volkswagen needs to compete with Tesla Inc. and Chinese rivals. The JV is focused on delivering models for Rivian and VW but is keeping communication open with third parties about the scalability of its platforms.

“We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry,” Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair, told journalists at an event in Palo Alto, California, in November. “That could become an opportunity” for others as well, he said.

Volkswagen is grappling with tariffs in the US, shrinking deliveries in China and muted demand in Europe. As part of its push to cut costs and bolster sales, it’s turning to Rivian for the kind of software and EV technology its initial battery-powered models were missing. The automaker is investing as much as $5.8 billion into the alliance, making it one of Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume’s biggest strategic bets.

The platform is designed to be scalable across vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets. The earnings potential from licensing the technology “is a very different ballgame,” Bensaid said, “and a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars.”

The venture plans to begin testing the system in winter conditions on Audi, VW and Scout models starting in the first quarter of 2026.

“There’s no Rivian versus VW versus Audi,” Bensaid said. “It’s Rivian and Audi and VW and potentially in the future other OEMs because of the breadth and scalability of the technology solution that we’re building.”

Like Tesla, BYD Co. and Xiaomi Corp., RV Tech is using zonal architecture, which requires fewer individual controllers to oversee a wider range of functions in the car’s front, central and rear sections. This reduces costs by cutting the number of computers and wiring needed.

Volkswagen has licensed its technology to other carmakers in the past, with Ford Motor Co. and Mahindra & Mahindra using the German carmaker’s first-generation platform for their own electric models.

The partners formed a joint venture one year ago that brings together software developers and engineers from both companies. They’re working with Rivian’s centralized electronics layout with fewer computing units that’s meant to help Volkswagen simplify development and cut costs. For loss-making Rivian, the investment is a financial lifeline as manufacturers rethink strategies in a slowing EV market.

While the JV is prioritizing the ramp-up and delivery of the underpinnings for electric models, there are parallels that would allow the technology to be used for combustion-engine cars as well, JV co-chair Carsten Helbing said.

The first car to get the new technology will be Rivian’s R2 sport utility vehicle, out early next year. VW’s compact EV, called ID. EVERY1, expected to cost around €20,000 (about $23,000), will follow in 2027, with rugged vehicles from the Scout brand due after that. Volkswagen has a similar partnership with Xpeng Inc. for the Chinese market.

Volkswagen’s earlier efforts to develop software in-house largely stumbled, first by holding up launches of its namesake brand’s ID models, then by handicapping those vehicles’ sales because of buggy features. The group, which also includes Audi and Porsche AG, has seen EV sales rise in Europe this year after improving software and updating models.

,EPA,2025-12-17 14:25:44+00:00,www.clarkhill.com,Whither WOTUS? What the Regulated Community Should Know about the Draft Revisions ...,Not Available,,,,,https://www.clarkhill.com/news-events/news/whither-wotus-what-the-regulated-community-should-know-about-the-draft-revisions-to-the-wotus-rule/,"Public comments on the draft rule are due by Jan. 5, 2026.
Does the draft rule prevail in these twin challenges of clarity and finality?
• The draft rule has an exclusion for ditches “constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.” However, the preamble asserts that a ditch that connects to a jurisdictional tributary is not itself jurisdictional.
• The draft rule provides that jurisdiction over a tributary is severed by reaches of non-relatively permanent flow.
Regulated entities should engage regarding both the federal WOTUS rule and in state processes to ensure their concerns are heard.","The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of pollutants from a point source to navigable waters without a permit. (33 USC 1311). This makes interpreting “navigable waters” key because this term defines the jurisdictional bounds of the Clean Water Act. Yet, the Act simply defines “navigable waters” as “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” (33 USC 1362(7)). Thus began the decades-long saga of the “waters of the United States,” or “WOTUS,” defined through multiple agency rulemaking bouts and no fewer than four journeys to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In the latest chapter, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published draft revisions to the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” on Nov. 20, 2025. 90 Fed. Reg. 52498. This is the second revision to the rule in the two-and-a-half years since the Supreme Court in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency held that WOTUS is limited to relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, and wetlands with a continuous surface connection to such tributaries. 598 U.S. 651 (2023). Public comments on the draft rule are due by Jan. 5, 2026.

The draft revisions follow the saga’s first actual foray into rhyme, as the notice of intent to engage in the rulemaking was entitled, “WOTUS Notice: The Final Response to SCOTUS.” 90 Fed. Reg. 13428 (March 24, 2025). Consistent with the theme of finality, the draft rule’s purpose was to “clarify the scope of Federal jurisdiction” in light of Sackett. 90 Fed. Reg. 52499.

Does the draft rule prevail in these twin challenges of clarity and finality? Significant aspects of the draft rule include:

• The key concept from Sackett of “relatively permanent” is defined as surface water that has standing or flowing water year-round or at least during the “wet season.” Similarly, the definition of “continuous surface connection” means a wetland that abuts a jurisdictional water and has surface water at least during the “wet season.” However, “wet season” remains undefined.

• The draft rule has an exclusion for ditches “constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.” However, the preamble asserts that a ditch that connects to a jurisdictional tributary is not itself jurisdictional. It is unclear how a ditch constructed entirely in dry land could physically connect to a jurisdictional tributary.

• The draft rule provides that jurisdiction over a tributary is severed by reaches of non-relatively permanent flow. However, it also introduces an exception when the tributary is “part of a water transfer.”

Although “wet season” is not defined in the draft rule itself, its potential application is discussed at length in the Preamble. Importantly, the concept may be challenging to apply in the arid west. The preamble discusses the fact that the “wet season” may occur during runoff from melting snowpack. However, this could be difficult to apply in practice. For instance, in Colorado, many plains streams do not flow in response to snowpack runoff at all. In mountain streams, the snowpack runoff period may be measured in weeks rather than months, and the timing may be variable from year to year. And, in many arid west states, surface water may occur during summer monsoons, but the monsoon season is also highly variable from year-to-year in terms of precipitation amounts and timing.

Meanwhile, the states have not stood still in their responses to Sackett. In the period following the publication of the draft WOTUS rule, western state developments include:

• New Mexico: The New Mexico Environment Department commenced the formal rulemaking process for amendments to the state’s regulations to create a discharge permit and dredge and fill permit program in a petition to the state’s Water Quality Control Commission on Nov. 24, 2025. This action follows legislation and informal regulatory activities earlier in 2025 (read more here). The petition requests a rulemaking hearing in June or July of 2026.

• Colorado: The Colorado Water Quality Control Commission completed a three-day rulemaking hearing on December 8-10, 2025, in which the WQCC adopted Regulation 87 creating a new state permitting program for discharges of dredged or fill material (Reg. 87 Dredge and Fill). Key issues resolved in the hearing included (a) standards for mitigation of ephemeral and intermittent streams; (b) projects requiring dual jurisdiction between state and federal programs; (c) whether to include a broad scale public interest review; (d) definition of a state-specific exclusion for wetlands adjacent to and supported by ditches; (e) the procedure to determine a project’s purpose and need, practicable alternatives and the subsequent alternatives analysis without injuring water rights; and (f) the fee structure for the program, which deviates significantly from the Army Corps’ fees.

• Arizona: The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has developed a list called the “Protected Surface Waters List” (PSWL), which includes both WOTUS and Non-WOTUS waters. If a water meets the federal CWA definition of a WOTUS, it is automatically included on the PSWL and regulated as a federally protected water. Waters deemed not to be a WOTUS under the current federal definition may be regulated through ADEQ’s Surface Water Protection Program (SWPP) as a Non-WOTUS Protected Surface Water if that water meets the definition of a state protected surface water, in accordance with Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S) §49-221(G). The PSWL is advisory only and does not constitute a final agency action or a jurisdictional determination for any water. It was created as part of the SWPP to increase regulatory clarity in Arizona. ADEQ does not have current plans to conduct a formal rulemaking to update the lists until guidance for a new WOTUS definition is finally released by the federal agencies (the EPA and United States Department of the Army) in response to the Sackett decision. (See 90 Fed. Reg. 52498, November 20, 2025). A list of waters regulated as WOTUS can be found in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 18, Chapter 11 (R18-11), Article 2 in Table B and Table C. A list of Non-WOTUS Protected Surface Waters can be found in R18–11, Article 2, Table A. If additional legal challenges are filed against the new WOTUS proposal by the federal agencies, then ADEQ will delay any final PWSL formal rulemaking.

What the Regulated Community Should Know Moving Forward

A significant issue going forward will be the relationship between state and federal programs, particularly given the differences between state definitions of “state waters” subject to regulation and the ever-shifting definition of WOTUS. Every action on the definition of WOTUS should be anticipated to prompt a reaction, at least in some states. Regulated entities should engage regarding both the federal WOTUS rule and in state processes to ensure their concerns are heard.

Precision means trying to find out the exact amount of input a plant needs.” On Dec. 10, growers connected with Ag-Center experts, state officials and representatives from the precision agriculture industry at the AgCenter’s Precision Agriculture Summit in Alexandria.
“Precision agriculture can generate great economic benefits provided we use it in the right way,” Goyal said while presenting at the summit.
Many precision agriculture technologies have developed slowly over the past 40 years, Zhou said, and recent technological advancements have accelerated the field’s progress.
For now, most precision agriculture technologies require a great deal of human labor, whether operating spraying drones or analyzing data.","Agricultural producers throughout Louisiana are embracing precision agriculture — a management strategy that relies on drones, sensors, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to collect data and make informed decisions to improve crop yields.

For decades, LSU Ag-Center researchers and extension agents have researched and taught producers about precision agriculture tools, such as sensors that aid in identifying plant stress and pinpoint crops’ fertilizer needs or variable rate technologies that can apply right amount of fertilizer, herbicide, fungicide and water at the right location.

As the precision agriculture realm has grown, the AgCenter has increased research and educational efforts to advance the field and added specialists, such as Congliang Zhou, an assistant professor for research and extension.

“For crop production, we need to have a lot of inputs — fertilizer, water, pesticides,” said Zhou, the AgCenter precision agriculture extension specialist. “But not every plant needs the same amount. Precision means trying to find out the exact amount of input a plant needs.”

On Dec. 10, growers connected with Ag-Center experts, state officials and representatives from the precision agriculture industry at the AgCenter’s Precision Agriculture Summit in Alexandria. At the summit, AgCenter researchers and extension specialists presented their findings on a wide range of topics that fit within the parameters of precision agriculture.

Precision agriculture research at the AgCenter explores several different avenues: using sensors to analyze soil and plant needs, testing sprayer drones that target weeds or dispense harvest aids over sugarcane, developing smartphone applications that can identify insects and many other projects.

These technologies have the potential to save producers time and money while also alleviating farm labor shortages, according to Raghav Goyal, an economist in the AgCenter Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness.

“Precision agriculture can generate great economic benefits provided we use it in the right way,” Goyal said while presenting at the summit.

Many precision agriculture technologies have developed slowly over the past 40 years, Zhou said, and recent technological advancements have accelerated the field’s progress.

For more than a decade, AgCenter engineer Randy Price has worked to test and improve agricultural drones while educating producers and young people about the technology. He has seen rapid improvements in unmanned aerial vehicles and has noticed an uptick in farmers adopting them.

“It looks viable now, and there is a lot of interest,” said Price, who is an associate professor based at the AgCenter Dean Lee Research and Extension Center in Alexandria. “They are remotely piloted, so it’s really safe for the pilot. We don’t worry about someone getting hurt or killed. And they are low cost — $20,000 to $30,000 or cheaper — and you could buy something and start spraying after meeting a few rules versus an airplane that’s $1 million or more or a (tractor-based) spray rig that is $500,000 or more. So, they’re really lucrative from those standpoints.”

Many Louisiana growers were introduced to precision agriculture through variable rate technologies, which relies on high-tech farm implements to vary the amounts of inputs such as fertilizer or pesticides applied to a field. The application amounts differ because of crop needs in specific areas, and these technologies can save farms money and prevent excess nutrients from washing off the field into waterways, said Brenda Tubaña, professor of soil fertility in the AgCenter School of Plant, Environmental and Soil Sciences.

“You’re not wasting fertilizer nor applying for nothing,” Tubaña said during her presentation at the summit.

During a panel discussion at the event, growers explained that precision agriculture has helped them become more efficient and save money, especially through variable rate technology. Using large drones to spray ripeners that aid in harvesting sugarcane has delivered a great return on investment for some producers and has allowed them to spray the ripeners, which promote sugar accumulation before harvest, at an optimal time.

“I want to sweeten my cane when I want to sweeten my cane,” said Josh Hebert, a central Louisiana farmer who bought a drone so he did not have to wait for a crop duster during the busy preharvest season.

Improvements in artificial intelligence also have unlocked new pathways for digital agriculture tools.

Ivan Grijalva, an Ag-Center assistant professor focused on precision pest management and data analytics, applies machine learning to train computers to detect redbanded stink bugs and other pest-related challenges, including weeds and diseases. He aims to develop technologies that help farmers scout fields more efficiently and generate prescription maps to guide management decisions and minimize chemical inputs.

Zhou has developed a robot that moves through sugarcane fields to help count cane stalks and assist with sugarcane breeding and variety development.

“When the robotic system is moving through the field, the sensor will collect data from different angles of each plot,” Zhou said. “Humans can only see from one angle. That’s the advantage. Then, AI can process the data in the field in real time, and based on our preliminary results, it will be more accurate than people we send into the field.”

The future of precision agriculture is “very exciting to see,” Zhou said. For now, most precision agriculture technologies require a great deal of human labor, whether operating spraying drones or analyzing data. That work will eventually be automated, too, Zhou said.

“Because labor shortages are a top issue for American agriculture,” he said, “I feel like AI and automation will be the future.”

One of Prism’s goals is to provide readers not just with accurate news about current events, but with the context needed to situate those events in the larger political landscape. Not just what is happening, but why and how. While Prism can’t cover every climate story, the reporting we do prioritize provides a way to read between the lines and connect the dots between seemingly disparate issues to paint a picture of how struggles for environmental justice are connected.

As promised by Project 2025, the Trump administration’s blueprint for dismantling the federal government, the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is disappearing. The U.S. is entering a period in which industry has near-total free rein to squeeze out profits in whatever ways it sees fit—including the weakening of regulations that govern chemical exposure and refusing to carry out programs for communities impacted by environmental justice.

As Prism has reported throughout the year, environmental injustice is not simply a category of harms levied onto vulnerable and disinvested communities of color, but the result of centuries of policy decisions. Legislative spending bills are statements of value and intentions for the future.

The last two decades in eastern Kentucky are prime examples. The community has spent years fending off attempts by Republican Rep. Hal Rogers to build a $500 million medium security prison. Appalachia has long been vulnerable to extractive industries, from coal mining to timber harvesting. In 2018, community groups succeeded in making sure that legacies of extraction would not continue into the modern era through the extraction of people’s bodies from their home communities. But the victory was short-lived, and the project was revived four years later. This year, however, an Indigenous women-led organization called the Appalachian Rekindling Project purchased some of the land slated for development, forcing the federal Bureau of Prisons to go back to the drawing board.

Prism has long drawn the manifold connections between incarceration and climate justice. This year, Prism Senior Reporter Alexandra Martinez doggedly covered the construction and legal evolution of the South Florida Detention Facility, also known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” because of its siting in the Everglades, a critical ecosystem that is home to hundreds of plant and animal species. The initial cost of Alligator Alcatraz was $608 million with a predicted annual cost of $450 million.

Built over eight days in late June, the immigrant detention center quickly drew ire from Indigenous tribes and local Floridians, who said that the development of the facility endangered those locked inside its walls as well as the ecosystems surrounding it.

Prism obtained records of a phone call made from a person detained inside the facility to his fiancée, in which he described how guards failed to provide emergency medical treatment to an immigrant who collapsed. He also described how guards subjected those detained at Alligator Alcatraz to chronic and arbitrary abuse, including beatings and humiliation, and how those inside did not have regular access to food and water. In December, the humanitarian group Amnesty International published its findings on the conditions inside the detention center, reporting that the treatment of immigrants detained at the facility operated by the Florida Department of Emergency Management constituted “torture.”

Most reporting portrays climate change as a series of discrete ecological events characterized by temperature variations: warmer oceans, colder winters, or more frequent storms. What these stories so often fail to acknowledge is that climate change isn’t just the weather. Rather, it’s the result of policy decisions that prioritize where to spend money and what—or who—to withhold public funding from.

In July, Prism reported on a surprise mid-May cancellation of environmental justice grants by the EPA. Grant recipients, such as Ira Vandever of the Navajo Nation, whose work includes the restoration of land polluted with heavy metals, were given notice via email with little information about how to appeal the arbitrary decision. Those with canceled grants were also left in the dark and on the hook for any funding gaps. Through public and political pressure, funding for some grantees, such as the Mi’kmaq Nation in Maine, was restored within a month of cancellation.

It wasn’t just grassroots pollution remediation efforts that suffered this year at the hands of a rogue EPA, but those relying on EPA grants to prepare regions against the impacts of mounting weather effects such as flooding.

Federal funding provides a critical bridge to emergency preparedness, but the Trump administration has placed its focus on the continued vilification of so-called DEI projects, a not-so-subtle dog whistle to the communities that benefit disproportionately from these programs. The cancellation of 105 grants selected by the Biden administration as part of the Community Change Grants program put a wrench in climate preparedness efforts led by communities in Appalachia, Mississippi, and Alaska. The program allocated funds through the Inflation Reduction Act to help address environmental justice issues, including supporting regions most vulnerable to the impacts of a rapidly changing climate and most unable to bear the financial fallout on their own.

These dire environmental challenges were made even worse when the Trump administration’s EPA announced its intention in August to scrap the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a rule that facilitated Clean Air Act regulation of greenhouse gases such as the air pollutant carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is in fact the most ubiquitous greenhouse gas and a major precipitator of global climate change. Already, the U.S. plays an outsized role in protracting climate change through its disproportionate per capita emissions and has demonstrated a continued ability to skirt international law, but the Trump administration’s dismantling of bedrock rules enshrines extractive supremacy and never-before-seen profits for polluters.

With no funding to mitigate environmental impacts brought by climate change and corporate injustices, it’s also important to note the slashing of the legal mechanisms available to environmental organizers fighting to protect ecosystem health. This summer, the Supreme Court gutted the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which provided activists with the ability to sue to stop destructive development projects sure to impact sensitive ecosystems and species. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of industry to restrict NEPA and the EPA’s ability to evaluate the downstream impacts of projects, which Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus referred to in the Texas Law Review as an “unraveling of the nation’s environmental protection laws.”

The second Trump administration’s dismantling of the EPA has also been a windfall for data centers across the country, especially in areas where state-level environmental agencies don’t have the funding or capacity to fill the federal gap in oversight. There are currently 4,296 data centers across the U.S., most clustered in Republican states where land is cheaper and that are more proximate to natural gas pipelines.

Data centers gobble up energy, resources, and water at alarming rates—actions made worse by the lack of federal guidelines regarding facilities’ usage. Communities targeted for data center development are also frustrated with the noise, water, and air pollution that results from their operation.

Data centers force communities to contend with increasing rates of pollution, but the facilities also drive up the costs of utilities. Ratepayers are tasked with footing the bill, mainly for upgrades to regional energy grid systems that are not accustomed to such large increases in power consumption. Data centers can consume as much energy as whole cities. In 2024, for example, data centers accounted for 4% of the country’s electricity consumption.

All of the movement around data centers puts a wrinkle in the country’s desire to decarbonize transportation, transition the energy grid to renewable sources, and see prices come down for critical services and goods such as heating and cooling. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are far cheaper than fossil fuels. For example, 91% of renewable energy projects commissioned in 2024 were more cost-effective than fossil fuel alternatives. In other words, renewable energy is good economics.

Perhaps one of the biggest—and most underreported—climate stories of the year is that the voting public isn’t aligned with current political leadership. According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, 63% of adults are very worried about global climate change, 74% support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 66% want a total transition to clean energy by 2050.

Americans’ stated desires are in direct opposition to the Trump administration’s actions. Voters want clear changes to the status quo, and sooner or later, elected officials will have to answer to climate change—either because voters take action or because the consequences of climate change become too loud to ignore.

He made the statement after the U.S. Department of Justice filed its response Monday night to the request for a preliminary injunction to change dam operations for the four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Oregon and four Columbia River dams downriver from the Tri-Cities.
“These losses come at exactly the wrong time,” said Scott Simms, chief executive director of the Public Power Council.
Trump administration ended agreement The Public Power Council is asking the federal court to encourage a collaborative path forward.
Opponents of the agreement called it a roadmap to removal of the lower Snake River dams.","A requested emergency order to change operations at Columbia and Snake river hydroelectric dams would raise electricity costs 17% for many Northwest customers, according to the Bonneville Power Administration.

States and groups seeking help for endangered salmon and steelhead in a decades-long federal lawsuit have asked the court for an emergency order to spill more water over eight dams, lowering the reservoirs behind them.

The changes are needed to protect endangered salmon and steelhead, say those requesting the temporary order, including the state of Oregon, conservation, fishing and clean energy groups. The state of Washington supports the filing.

According to Earthjustice, spilling more water over dams would allow more juvenile fish to pass over the dams instead of through hydroelectric turbines, and the lower reservoir levels would shorten the time salmon spend migrating through slower and warmer water behind dams.

‘Hidden double-digit tax’

But the Public Power Council, a defendant in the case, says that those changes have no proven benefits to fish and would drive up electricity costs by $152 million to $169 million annually.

The Public Power Council represents nearly 100 consumer-owned electric utilities across the Pacific Northwest, including in the Tri-Cities.

“The litigation is like a hidden double-digit tax on electricity customers that threatens real harm to lower-income families, schools, farms and businesses without providing any proven benefits to salmon,” said Kurt Miller, chief executive officer of the Northwest Public Power Association. NWPPA represents 150 community-owned electric utilities.

He made the statement after the U.S. Department of Justice filed its response Monday night to the request for a preliminary injunction to change dam operations for the four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Oregon and four Columbia River dams downriver from the Tri-Cities. The response included the BPA analysis.

The BPA analysis warned that the proposed operational changes would make frequent grid emergencies, such as energy shortages and rotating blackouts, inevitable.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, with the support of Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, has initiated litigation that “threatens the very citizens who they were elected to represent,” Miller said.

The Public Power Council said that the changes would eliminate about 2 million megawatt-hours of hydropower production each year while increase carbon emissions as the lost hydropower is replaced primarily by natural gas generation.

“These losses come at exactly the wrong time,” said Scott Simms, chief executive director of the Public Power Council. The Pacific Northwest is facing rapid growth in demand for electricity, he said,

The amount of water spilled over hydro dams has already been increased, and more spill would yield only small, incremental improvements for fish, said Andrew Deines, managing scientist at Exponent, whose opinion was included in court documents opposing the preliminary injunction.

Trump administration ended agreement

The Public Power Council is asking the federal court to encourage a collaborative path forward.

“After more than two decades of litigation, it should be clear that court-ordered operational mandates are not a durable solution,” Simms said. “The region needs a negotiated approach that support salmon recovery, respects tribal treaty rights, protects grid reliability and keeps power affordable for the people of the Northwest.”

The request for a preliminary injunction was filed in October after the Trump administration ended the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement with tribes and the states of Oregon and Washington that was signed by the Biden administration.

The 2023 agreement put the decades-long federal case on hold, while removal of four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Washington was studied and the federal government paid for salmon recovery and tribal renewable energy projects.

Signed by the Nez Perce and other tribes in the basin, the agreement was seen by salmon advocates as a breakthrough in their decades-long effort to recover wild salmon and steelhead that are protected by the Endangered Species Act.

Opponents of the agreement called it a roadmap to removal of the lower Snake River dams.

The proposed preliminary injunction would require emergency conservation measures in addition to changes to dam operations.

They include removing passage barriers slowing the migration of Tucannon River spring chinook in Eastern Washington, as well as increasing federal efforts to control predators like invasive walleye and some birds that prey on salmon and steelhead.",https://www.thenewstribune.com/public/latest-news/3hn5q8/picture259834625/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/220326%20cb%20salmon_54.JPG,N,,2025-12-17 14:00:05.271819

Council members broadly face two options.
Meanwhile, the City Council just voted to shave $95 million from its annual budget after voters rejected a property tax hike in November.
""There's no question this project is going to cost a lot,"" City Council Member Chito Vela told KUT News.
""This is hugely concerning,"" City Council Member Paige Ellis said at a Mobility Committee meeting this month upon hearing the news.","A looming decision over parks above I-35 is forcing Austin City Council members to weigh two risky paths forward, and elected officials are beginning to split over which direction the city should take.

This fork in the road centers on a deceptively simple question: Which highway decks should the city commit to paying for?

Council members broadly face two options. They could agree now to building the full set of caps the city has planned, effectively locking them into the massive I-35 expansion project as it moves forward. Or they could hold off, leaving the door open to adding caps later, but at a significantly higher cost.

Either way, most of the payments wouldn't be due until the early 2030s. But the answer will shape how much the project ultimately costs and could determine whether large sections of I-35 ever get capped at all.

Council members split on what to do

The general footprint of the city's ""Cap and Stitch"" project was already set in May. A divided City Council agreed to spend $104 million in future years on the support columns and foundations needed to hold the decks over I-35 after the Texas Department of Transportation sinks the main lanes.

Under that plan, the largest sequence of caps would span I-35 from Cesar Chavez Street to Seventh Street, potentially creating one of the most prominent parks in Central Austin.

Another cap would cover the freeway between 11th and 12th streets, providing a gateway to Austin's African-American Cultural Heritage District. Two smaller ""stitches,"" each roughly 300 feet wide, would be built near the Hancock Center between 41st Street and Capital Metro's Red Line crossing.

What the council has not decided is whether and when to commit to paying for the decks themselves. TxDOT is rebuilding the highway, but it will not fund the caps. That decision now sits squarely with the city.

Both options carry real risks. Committing early would require the council to act before detailed designs are finished, creating uncertainty around the final price tag. Waiting would reduce that uncertainty, but city and state officials agree it would drive up the cost by 35% or more and could make some caps harder to build.

The project's price tag is murky at this relatively early stage, but estimates have pegged the cost of the 14 acres of decks — with nothing on them yet — at almost $400 million. Meanwhile, the City Council just voted to shave $95 million from its annual budget after voters rejected a property tax hike in November.

""There's no question this project is going to cost a lot,"" City Council Member Chito Vela told KUT News. ""The reality is, though, when it's done it will have huge economic benefits in terms of additional property tax revenues that are going to be brought in to the city.""

Vela pointed in particular to the stretch of I-35 closest to downtown. ""Looking at that highway cap between Cesar Chavez through Seventh Street, if we were to cap that area of the highway and put some nice amenities on it, we are potentially building one of the best downtown parks in Texas,"" he said.

Other council members are more wary.

Council Member Krista Laine, who voted against the project in May, said the financial risk has only increased since then. She pointed to inflation, tariffs, labor shortages and the Trump administration's decision to cancel a $105 million federal grant for the Cap and Stitch project.

""I haven't heard any news about new funding sources that have come into play. It's been many months since we had that discussion and took that vote,"" Laine told KUT News. ""We need to make sure that we have enough capacity for the needs of the city, given the very significant revenue constraints.""

City and TxDOT disagree on May deadline

Adding urgency to the situation is an apparent disconnect between how TxDOT and city of Austin staff view the project's next milestone.

TxDOT says it needs an estimate by May of how many caps the city is considering funding with a formal council vote in November. The state agency says it needs an approximate number so it can start negotiations with highway design firms.

City staff see it differently, saying they can't provide even an early signal about how much highway the city plans to cap without formal direction from the City Council. From their perspective, the city's governance structure doesn't give staff the leeway to offer even a ballpark estimate on a project involving hundreds of millions of dollars.

As a result, city staff are treating May as a firm decision point. They're asking council members to vote by then on how much, if anything, the city is willing to commit toward the caps, even if a formal funding decision isn't required by TxDOT until November.

Emissions trading, one of the most – if not the most – crucial climate policy instruments, will be a key focus.
The EU has set a price on CO2 emissions to incentivise the right investments by companies to shift to a climate friendly society.
However, election dynamics could spell further trouble for ambitious climate policy decisions next year.
The EU’s climate and energy agenda in 2026 will also be marked by a continued focus on industry competitiveness, and a general drive for independence.","After a year marked by the rollback of existing climate rules – from weakening deforestation regulations and company sustainability reporting obligations, to postponing emissions trading in transport and buildings – the EU will begin looking forward in its climate debates in 2026. Negotiations on the European Union’s next long-term budget, alongside talks on climate and energy rules for the post-2030 period, are set to take centre stage.

“After adopting the 90-percent climate target for 2040, the debate will shift towards what this means for individual sectors in the post-2030 policy framework and how to mobilise investments,” said Linda Kalcher, executive director and founder of the Brussels-based think tank Strategic Perspectives.

Similar to the 2021 “Fit for 55” package of energy and climate reform proposals to reach the 2030 target of reducing emissions by 55 percent, the European Commission is expected to present a follow-up package next year. In the third quarter, it plans to propose reforms to key rules and regulations, from the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the renewable energy framework to the future of national climate targets currently governed by the effort sharing regulation.

Climate policy has given room to other priorities over the past years, and if current efforts to weaken policies to avoid and reduce greenhouse gas emissions persist, the EU risks locking in an energy and climate architecture that lacks the necessary ambition to sufficiently contribute to the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to well below 2 °C.

Emissions trading, one of the most – if not the most – crucial climate policy instruments, will be a key focus. The EU has set a price on CO2 emissions to incentivise the right investments by companies to shift to a climate friendly society.

EU countries recently decided to delay the start of the new ETS 2 for transport and building emissions by one year to 2028. Several governments worried that a uniform CO2 price across the EU would lead to steep increases in petrol, fossil gas or heating oil costs, which would hit low-income households in poorer member states especially hard, as these often lack the resources to switch to climate-friendly alternatives. Governments said this could fuel public resistance to climate action.

However, experts warned that further changes to the system loom, especially if the EU fails to alleviate governments’ worries. Countries like Poland had called for the start of the system to be delayed by several years, and could easily make the same arguments half a year from now.

“Of course, this will be discussed again,” said Brigitte Knopf, founder of the think tank Zukunft KlimaSozial.

Similarly, the original ETS for the energy and industry sectors is facing headwinds. Industry has called for adjustments that would weaken the system, and German officials have proposed extending the ETS by several years. Under current rules, the emissions cap is set to reach zero by around 2039, so no new allowances would be given out from that time, leaving only existing unused allowances in the market. The European Commission is set to review the ETS by summer. That review, together with the package to reach the 2040 climate target, will present key moments to kickstart reforms to the system.

Experts have called on countries to ensure that the ETS is preserved.

“If ETS-1 is substantially watered down in 2026, without massively strengthening other pillars, the whole structure risks collapsing, tanking overall clean investments,” Philipp Jäger, senior policy fellow at the Jacques Delors Centre think tank, told Clean Energy Wire. Germany and other EU governments that still back climate objectives should do more to safeguard it, he said.

However, election dynamics could spell further trouble for ambitious climate policy decisions next year. In 2027, voters in major European economies - including France, Italy, and Poland - head to the polls.

“The importance of 2027 as a 'super-election year' in the EU should not be understated,” said researcher Kalcher. “It brings additional volatility,” as countries might struggle to position themselves ahead of elections, she said.

The EU’s climate and energy agenda in 2026 will also be marked by a continued focus on industry competitiveness, and a general drive for independence.

In its 2026 work programme, titled “Europe's Independence Moment”, the European Commission has said that the EU must “shape its own future” on wide-ranging issues like climate action, security and defence, the development of its democracy or jobs and a modern economy.

Europe’s ability to do so will be influenced by several crucial political dynamics, said think tank E3G in a preview article for 2026. Europe’s strategic dependencies leave it exposed to foreign influence and interference, while an increasingly fragmented European Parliament lacks one stable majority, which makes the institution’s positions on issues less predictable.

The think tank sees four challenges for the EU’s independence bid:

Rebuilding Europe’s financial autonomy and capacity to invest

Harnessing electrification and circularity as levers for strategic autonomy, competitiveness and energy security

Protecting citizens while visibly delivering tangible benefits

Diversifying partnerships and deepening international cooperation

Throughout next year, the EU institutions will negotiate the Commission’s draft for the union’s next long-term budget for the period from 2028 to 2034. The Commission has proposed dedicating 35 percent of the almost two-trillion-euro budget to climate and environment objectives, which NGOs have criticised as too little. E3G emphasises that the EU must also set the right framework to rebuild investor confidence and improve its capacity to mobilise private capital.

Researcher Kalcher said Europe should make sure it invests domestically, instead of paying third countries for imports. “With the EU budget on the table and the proposals on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and industrial decarbonisation coming, it’s high time to invest into Europe instead of sending money to the US, Russia or Qatar,” she said.

Europe remains heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, and the transition to renewables is seen as an opportunity to reduce these dependencies overall.

E3G calls on the EU to push for a more circular economy in 2026, as this would lower imports and energy use, “creating new markets for affordable, European recycled materials and products.” The upcoming Industrial Accelerator Act, Circular Economy Act, Innovation Act, and revised public procurement rules are expected to be key developments in this regard next year.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-17 11:00:09.973541

Ford will take a roughly $20 billion hit, but the company expects the recalibration of its electric vehicle strategy to prove more profitable in the long run.

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said the “customer-driven shift” will strengthen the company.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business,” Farley said in an announcement Monday.

Kelley Blue Book automotive expert Sean Tucker said the cancellation of the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup headlines the changes announced by Ford.

“They're cancelling a number of large EVs that they had planned, but they're not abandoning the EV market,” Tucker said.

Ford said it still expects about half of its global inventory will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030, up from 17% this year.

And the company has big plans for its universal EV platform, which will be used to roll out lower-priced, smaller cars and trucks, beginning with a midsize pickup in 2027.

Meanwhile, an extended-range EV version of the F-150 Lightning will come to market to replace the fully electric version.

An extended-range EV uses gas power to recharge the EV battery, but the gas doesn't directly power the vehicle's movement.

The engine is effectively a generator, not actually attached to the drivetrain in any way, Tucker said.

An extended-range EV solves the fundamental problem of towing that has held electric trucks back, he said.

“All trucks lose about half the range when they tow, regardless of what their fuel source is,” Tucker said. “But that's a much bigger deal when stopping to recharge takes hours than it is when stopping to fill a tank takes two minutes.”

Plus, big trucks are most popular in the parts of the country where EV infrastructure is poor, Tucker said.

Ford said the next-generation extended-range EV, or EREV, F-150 Lightning will add an estimated 700-plus mile range and tow “like a locomotive.”

Tucker said Ford made the right call.

“It was an understandable decision in 2021 to say, ‘Our bestselling product is the F-150. Why don’t we just electrify our bestselling product first?’ But the market for electric full-size trucks is just, it hasn't really emerged,” Tucker said. “And I think that the EREV is probably a more realistic technology, that the sort of person who's interested in a full-size truck might listen to that more than they would to a pure EV.”

RELATED STORY: Trump tries to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements

Tucker said KBB estimates that dealers have about a 147-day supply of fully electric F-150 Lightning trucks, so folks who want to buy one still have time.

Tucker said American automakers have a tough time balancing domestic and international markets, with about a quarter of the overseas market already electric. Stateside, it’s just 7% or so, Tucker said.

That creates a two-tiered, expensive production strategy, one for the North American market and one for the rest of the world.

Tucker said the U.S. market is still moving toward EVs, but it’s moving more slowly than initial projections.

And Tucker said Ford’s decisions have more to do with market demands than politics, with President Donald Trump trying to reduce car prices by rolling back gas mileage requirements.

“Politicians want a lot of headlines talking about the automotive industry, but the automotive industry does not move at the speed of politics,” Tucker said. “If you sit down to design a new car today, it's going to roll out to the public in about five to seven years. It's a long design cycle. So, I don't think they're making a lot of quick decisions based on something the president did last month.”",https://midmichigannow.com/resources/media2/16x9/8380/1320/47x575/90/443d8481-4e5a-4d33-97ee-293b7f730794-GettyImages2252102754.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:01:48.287166

Solar gained momentum in regions once seen as peripheral, from Central Europe to Africa, while BRICS nations crossed a major milestone by generating more than half of global solar power. Rapid advances in battery technology and a decline in prices brought around-the-clock solar into credible, near-commercial reality, opening the door to fossil-free baseload power in sunny regions.

The rise of “electrotech” – solar, wind, batteries and electrified transport, heating and industry – became the dominant engine of global energy growth, led by China’s emergence as the world’s first electrostate. As AI and data centre demand grew, clean power and strong grids became the new competitive edge for modern economies.

Clean energy momentum builds as solar and wind outpace global electricity demand growth

Solar and wind are now expanding fast enough to meet all new electricity demand, a milestone reached in the first three quarters of 2025. Ember’s analysis published in November shows that these technologies are no longer just catching up; they are outpacing demand growth itself. Together, solar and wind supplied 17.6% of global electricity in the first three quarters of 2025, up from 15.2% over the same period last year, pushing the total share of low-carbon sources to 43%.

For the first time across a sustained period, renewables, including solar, wind, hydro and smaller sources such as geothermal, generated more electricity than coal. At the heart of this shift is solar, whose growth was more than three times larger than any other source of electricity so far in 2025, confirming its role as the dominant force reshaping the global power system. Another analysis showed that the world is set to add 793 GW of renewable capacity in 2025, up 11% from the 717 GW added in 2024. At this pace, only a modest increase in annual additions is needed for the world to stay on track to triple global renewables by 2030.

Solar starting to take off in places that were once behind

In 2025, solar strengthened in markets that had long trailed behind the global leaders, as solar showed its potential to leapfrog fossil generation in emerging markets. Several countries outside the traditional frontrunners like China and Europe, are now recording sharper growth thanks to falling costs, easing supply bottlenecks and clearer policy signals.

In August 2025, Ember reported that there’s clear evidence of solar now accelerating across Africa. Imports of Chinese solar panels rose 60% in the 12 months to June 2025, with South Africa still the largest buyer but 20 other countries also posting record orders. Total imports reached 15 GW of capacity, up from 9.4 GW the year before. Some markets saw dramatic jumps. Algeria’s imports rose 33-fold, Zambia eightfold, Botswana sevenfold and Sudan sixfold, while Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Benin, Angola and Ethiopia all more than tripled their imports.

Central Europe, a region once behind on solar generation, is now expanding faster than many traditional European Union (EU) leaders. Summer 2025 underscored this momentum. In June, Hungary generated more than 40% of its electricity from solar, while Poland and Czechia also recorded their highest monthly solar output to date.

By 2024, the ten BRICS countries accounted for more than half of global solar generation – 51%, up from just 15% a decade earlier. This rapid rise signals a major shift in the centre of gravity of the global energy transition.

Rising solar and wind have reached scale in major electricity markets worldwide

2025 showed that wind and solar are now reaching scale in major economies around the world, fundamentally reshaping the energy system. In August, wind and solar generated over a third of Brazil’s electricity for the first month on record. In the EU, solar became the single largest source of power in June 2025. In Spain, expanding wind and solar has slashed the pricing power of fossil generators by 75% since 2019. The UK crossed a major threshold in September 2025 as wind and solar delivered more than half its electricity for the first time. California reached its own milestone too, with solar now standing as the state’s largest source of power. India is moving in the same direction. Ember’s October 2025 analysis showed that the country does not need to build coal capacity beyond what is already planned under its National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2032, provided it meets targets for solar, wind and storage.

The common thread is clear: as clean power reaches higher shares, it begins to set the price, weaken the influence of expensive fossil fuel-based generation and reduce imports. What once looked like just growth is now transforming market dynamics, affordability and energy security all at once.

Electrotech revolution accelerates in 2025

Electrotech, a set of efficient, scalable electricity-based technologies like solar, wind, batteries, EVs and heat pumps, is now the main driver of global energy growth. Solar capacity has doubled roughly every three years for 30 years, battery storage has nearly doubled annually since 2020 and EV sales have surged fifteenfold to 17.5 million since 2017. China, the world’s first “electrostate,” leads this transformation. It accounts for half of global solar panel installations, 60% of EV sales and two-thirds of global growth in electricity demand since 2019. In H1-2025, China’s fossil demand in electricity generation was down by 2%. Emerging markets from Viet Nam to Mexico and South Africa to India are leapfrogging older fossil systems, surpassing the United States in solar’s share of electricity. Mastery of the electric tech stack like batteries, motors and power electronics is now critical for industrial growth, jobs and strategic autonomy.

24/365 Solar is now within reach – thanks to rapidly falling battery costs

Steep declines in battery costs and rapid storage deployment are turning solar into a reliable power source for almost 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Ember’s June 2025 analysis shows that in high-insolation regions, solar paired with batteries can already deliver round-the-clock electricity at around US $104/MWh, undercutting new coal and nuclear, making “solar as baseload” both technically credible and increasingly cost-competitive. Mexico illustrates the potential benefits of such a shift: falling battery prices could unlock gigawatts of new solar and cut reliance on imported fossil fuels, with Ember estimating annual savings of about $1.6 billion USD from avoided gas imports.

India’s heavy industry story highlights another frontier of opportunity: large industrial consumers can now meet up to 80% of their annual electricity needs with clean power by combining solar, wind and storage in a cost-effective procurement mix. In many regions of India, the cost of such hybrid, round-the-clock clean power is already competitive with, and often cheaper than, coal-based supply.

Batteries are also emerging as a multi-tool for the power sector. Beyond storing excess RE, they provide fast frequency response, black start capabilities and other essential grid services that strengthen system reliability.

As storage costs continue to drop, solar-plus-batteries is emerging as the most scalable pathway to clean, reliable, fossil fuel-free electricity.

Clean power becomes the foundation of the global AI race

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data centre growth became one of the most discussed energy issues of 2025. Those able to meet rising electricity demand will be positioned at the forefront of the technology revolution – and solar and wind are proving they are up to the job. Ember’s ASEAN analysis showed that data centres could account for 2–30% of national electricity demand by 2030, excluding Viet Nam. In Malaysia, for example, emissions could increase sevenfold if this growth is met with fossil-heavy grids, while up to 30% of this demand could instead be supplied by solar and wind. In Europe, the bottleneck is infrastructure: grid congestion in hubs such as Frankfurt, London and Dublin has created 7–10-year connection queues, pushing new AI investment toward regions with cleaner, more available capacity. The message is clear: the AI race is now an electricity and grid race. Countries that scale renewables and accelerate grid upgrades will be the ones that capture the next wave of digital economic growth.

What’s in store for 2026?

As 2025 comes to an end, the direction of travel is unmistakable: clean power is scaling, markets are shifting and the electricity system is becoming the centre of economic strategy – from AI growth to energy security. In 2026, the challenge will be turning this momentum into system-level transformation. Countries that expand storage, fix grid bottlenecks, set higher ambition and empower markets to integrate renewables will shape the next phase of global leadership.

The current administration has been rolling back permits for renewable energy projects, including hydrogen, in the United States, instead opting for an expansion of the conventional energy market led by the gas and oil sectors. However, that has not stopped cities like Los Angeles from bringing online a new hydrogen-ready power plant to replace coal-powered energy generation.

The city of Los Angeles has completely cut out the use of coal to power the populace

Los Angeles has become a major driver for the progressive nature of the renewable energy market, which must be driving Donald Trump up the wall. Trump has been waging a theoretical war with California’s Governor, Gavin Newsom. The two have been trading blows on a variety of platforms, with Trump canceling federal funding for a massive hydrogen hub in the city.

Newsom reacted by launching a social media campaign that mimics and pokes fun at the President’s social media style. With no end in sight to this theoretical war between Trump and Newsom, the situation has become as tense as a bridal shower with no cake. LA has set the international energy market alight with the announcement that the city has completely phased out the use of coal-powered energy and replaced it with a turnkey hydrogen power plant.

Los Angeles has officially commissioned the new hydrogen power plant to reshape regional energy use

City officials have stated that LA has officially ended the generational reliance on coal-powered energy generation and immediately pivoted to a new energy generation facility in Utah that runs on a well-balanced mix of natural gas and green hydrogen. The facility in Utah is the largest green hydrogen power plant anywhere in the world, and has been designed to eventually run on 100% hydrogen.

The pivot to hydrogen has been led by LA’s aggressive 2035 clean energy mandate

Los Angeles has developed a 2035 clean energy mandate that has been accelerated by the news that the city has entirely phased out coal usage. City officials have noted the need to foster a new energy resource that can compete with the 24/7, reliable energy generation properties of coal, and hydrogen has emerged as the clear favorite that will not sacrifice energy production levels in the name of progress.

The mandate in LA calls for more integrated renewable energy projects that will deliver vast amounts of clean energy that do not rely on fossil fuels. The new development has three key factors that will influence the production and use of hydrogen, namely:

Significantly advanced gas turbines that can handle burning hydrogen blends

An on-site renewable energy generation facility for electrolysis, needed to generate green hydrogen

A massive slat cavern designed to store the energy resources

The astonishing advancements in hydrogen energy technology have brought the sector to the forefront of the collective energy market. We can not understate the importance of LA running on hydrogen as it marks the first time in history that such a large city has transitioned away from coal to the renewable energy sector.

Los Angeles is the first, but won’t be the last city powered by clean energy

LA might be the first major city in the world to turn away from coal-powered energy generation, but it certainly won’t be the last. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s astonishing NEOM city will have a hydrogen power facility that will power the new city into the future. Decarbonizing the energy market is a shared responsibility of the largest stakeholders in the world, and through the new hydrogen-ready power plant, LA is on the verge of making history, although the first hydrogen-based energy is still a few months away.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/6.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:05.209385

Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.","A WOTUS Rule That Respects Farmers

For a decade now, farmers and ranchers have been calling for a clear Waters of the U.S. rule that respects our careful stewardship. For many of us, the definition of WOTUS isn’t a distant policy discussion—it’s personal. The WOTUS rule determines how we manage our land, how we plan conservation work, and how we keep our farms running without getting tangled in unclear regulations.

Clean water is essential for every farmer and rancher—we depend on it every day. That’s why we’re encouraged to see the new proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers. The proposal protects critical water resources while recognizing the work farmers do to care for the land. It is clear that the agencies are responding to concerns raised by farmers and bringing much-needed clarity to the rule.

The WOTUS Rule Matters for Clean Water and Agriculture

Farmers understand the importance of clean water—our farms and our families depend on it. We rely on it for our crops, our livestock and our daily lives. We spend countless hours putting conservation practices in place to protect our water sources and to improve the land we care for. Clean water is part of every decision we make on the farm, from how we manage our soil to how we rotate our livestock on pastures and protect our streams.

But protecting water starts with clear and workable rules. When definitions stretch too far, ordinary farm activities can fall under burdensome and costly federal oversight. That can turn routine work into a regulatory guessing game, slowing progress instead of supporting it. A practical WOTUS rule must balance environmental protection with the realities of farming.

Farm Bureau’s Continued Leadership on WOTUS

The latest proposal shows movement toward the clarity farmers have been calling for. It reflects some of the concerns raised over the years and responds to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA that federal agencies must rein in their regulatory overreach.

Farm Bureau has long called for consistent and fair guidelines surrounding the Clean Water Act. We are reviewing every detail of the new proposal and crafting comments that reflect the real-world challenges farmers and ranchers are facing. Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.

We will continue to share farmers’ stories and remind policymakers that regulatory certainty is essential for long-term stewardship. When the rules are clear and fair, farmers can keep doing what we do best—caring for the land and producing the food, fiber, and renewable fuel American families depend on.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Issues/WOTUS/_socialwFacebook/AFBF_BaileyCorwine_IrrigationDitch-feat.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 07:58:31.949849

If the community fails to confront them in rebuilding, “you make them a hell of a lot more likely.” Lempert doesn’t see a mass exodus from high-fire-hazard areas as a viable solution.
(Out of the nearly 10,000 buildings First Street studies in the Palisades, 82% carry that level of risk.)
In this case, living in Pacific Palisades carries a nonzero risk you lose your house or life to fire.
Perhaps it is that, in the next fire, the Palisades doesn’t lose any homes or lives (and, ideally, accomplishes this without spending billions).","In what used to be a dry cleaner’s on Sunset Boulevard, Robert Lempert listened, hands clasped behind his back, as his neighbors finally took a moment to step away from recovery’s endless stream of paperwork, permits, bills and bureaucracy to, instead, envision a fire-resilient Pacific Palisades in 2035.

As a researcher at RAND, Lempert has spent decades studying how communities, corporations and governments can use computer simulations to understand complex problems with huge uncertainties — from how an Alaska town can better warn its residents about landslides to how climate change is worsening disasters and what strategies the United Nations can support to address them.

In January, one such complex problem ran straight through his neighborhood and burned down his house.

As Lempert and his wife process their own trauma forged by flames, Lempert has become fixated on capturing the flickers of insights from fellow survivors and, hopefully, eventually, transforming them into computer programs that could help the community rebuild the Palisades into a global leader in wildfire resilience.

“Otherwise, we won’t end up with a functional community that anybody wants to — or can — live in,” he said. “You can spin out all sorts of disaster scenarios” for the Pacific Palisades of 2035. If the community fails to confront them in rebuilding, “you make them a hell of a lot more likely.”

Lempert doesn’t see a mass exodus from high-fire-hazard areas as a viable solution. Out of the more than 12 million buildings the climate risk modeling company First Street studies in California, 4 in 10 have at least a 5% chance of facing a wildfire in the next 30 years. (Out of the nearly 10,000 buildings First Street studies in the Palisades, 82% carry that level of risk.) And the areas without significant fire risk have their own environmental challenges: flooding, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts. Learning to live with these risks, consequently, is part of the practice of living in California — and really, in most of the places humans have settled on Earth.

So, Lempert has taken to the modus operandi he helped develop at RAND:

Identify the problem. In this case, living in Pacific Palisades carries a nonzero risk you lose your house or life to fire.

Define the goals. Perhaps it is that, in the next fire, the Palisades doesn’t lose any homes or lives (and, ideally, accomplishes this without spending billions).

Then, the real work: Code up a bunch of proposed solutions from all of the groups with wildly disparate views on how the system (i.e., Southern California wildfires) works.

Stress-test those solutions against a wide range of environmental conditions in the computer. Extreme winds, downed communication systems, closed evacuation routes — the list goes on.

Finally, sit back, and see what insights the computer spits out.

It’s easy enough to agree on the problem, goals and environmental factors. For the proposed solutions, Lempert set out to collect data.

Poster paper with residents’ handwritten ideas now fills the walls of the former dry cleaner’s, now the headquarters of the grassroots organization Palisades Recovery Coalition. It’s through these “visioning charrettes” that Lempert hopes his community can develop a magic solution capable of beating the computer’s trials.

The streets could be lined with next-generation homes of concrete and steel where even the tiniest gaps are meticulously sealed up to keep embers from breaching the exterior. Each home could be equipped with rain-capture cisterns, hooked up to a neighborhood-wide system of sensors and autonomous fire hoses that intelligently target blazes in real time. One or two shiny new fire stations — maybe even serving as full-blown fire shelters for residents, equipped with food and oxygen to combat the smoke — might sit atop one of the neighborhood’s main thoroughfares, Palisades Drive. The street, formerly a bottleneck during evacuations, might now have a dedicated emergency lane.

Every year, the community could practice a Palisades-wide evacuation drill so the procedures are fresh in the mind. Community brigades might even train with the local fire departments so, during emergencies, they can effectively put out spot fires and ensure their elderly neighbors get out safely.

Lempert, who now lives in a Santa Monica apartment with his wife, doesn’t entertain speculation about whether the Palisades will ever reach this optimistic vision — even though his own decision to move back someday, in part, hinges on the answer.

Right now, all that matters is that change is possible.

He pointed to an anecdote he heard once from the fire historian Stephen Pyne: American cities used to burn down — from within — all the time in the 19th century. Portland, Maine, burned in 1866 thanks to a Fourth of July firecracker. Chicago in 1871, after a blaze somehow broke out in a barn. Boston the following year, this time starting in a warehouse basement. Eventually, we got fed up with our cities burning down, so we created professional fire departments, stopped building downtowns out of wood and bolstered public water systems with larger water mains and standardized fire hydrants. Then, it stopped happening.

Now we face a new fire threat — this time, from the outside. Maybe we’re fed up enough to do something about it.

“Cities shouldn’t burn down,” Lempert said with a chuckle, amused by the simplicity of his own words. “So let’s just design them so they don’t.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e839a61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7561x3970+0+537/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Fb2%2Fe9c664d442ffbfd46efc1e2e1d46%2F1529228-me-palisades-fire-vignette-robert-lempert-jja-0001.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:09.146566

MONROVIA — Conservation International (CI) Liberia, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has launched a US$316,300 Natural Capital Accounting Small Grant Program aimed at strengthening local expertise and integrating environmental data into Liberia’s national development planning.

The program, funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), was unveiled Tuesday at a ceremony in central Monrovia attended by senior government officials, development partners, civil society representatives and members of the media. Three local nongovernmental organizations — VADEMCO, BASA Development Initiatives, and The Nature Compact (TNC) — are the initial beneficiaries.

CI-Liberia Country Director Momodu Kemokai said the initiative is designed to help Liberia recognize its forests, biodiversity and ecosystems as economic assets rather than overlooked externalities in public decision-making.

“Liberia is blessed with extraordinary natural wealth, extensive tropical forests, unique biodiversity, freshwater ecosystems, and coastal and marine resources that sustain thousands of households,” Kemokai said. “Yet these assets have historically been invisible in national accounting systems, unmeasured, undervalued and often overexploited.”

He warned that development planning that ignores the value of nature risks becoming “short-sighted, costly and unsustainable.”

Kemokai said Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) provides a science-based framework that allows policymakers to factor environmental assets into decisions affecting forestry, mining, fisheries, agriculture, energy and infrastructure. For Liberia, he added, NCA must move beyond theory and become a practical tool for resilience and long-term growth.

“It should help us answer fundamental questions about the value of our forests, rivers and biodiversity, how these assets are changing, and what must be done to safeguard them for future generations,” he said.

According to Kemokai, the Small Grant Program is structured to build Liberian-led research and implementation capacity, supporting hands-on environmental data collection, analysis and policy engagement. The initiative also seeks to promote transparency and accountability through civil society involvement and to encourage young researchers to develop innovative approaches to measuring ecosystem services.

He said expanding local expertise will improve data quality while empowering Liberians to drive conservation and sustainable development efforts themselves.

Kemokai reaffirmed CI-Liberia’s broader commitment to supporting the country’s environmental agenda, citing ongoing collaboration with the EPA, Forestry Development Authority, Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, Ministry of Mines and Energy, National Fisheries and Aquaculture Authority and other institutions.

Launching the program on behalf of EPA Executive Director Dr. Emmanuel K. Urey Yarkpawolo, Deputy Executive Director for Administration and Finance Anthony S. Kollie praised CI-Liberia’s long-standing support to Liberia’s conservation sector.

“Your continued commitment to strengthening local institutions in environmental management is commendable,” Kollie said, adding that the EPA remains fully committed to the partnership.

Beneficiary organizations welcomed the grants, describing them as timely support for community-level climate and environmental action. Clarence Powell, project manager of the Sinoe Building Climate Resilience initiative at BASA Development Initiatives, thanked CI-Liberia and the EPA for the assistance.

“The work we do is in the interest of the country, and this support will help us address key environmental challenges,” Powell said.

Marvelous Queejay-Weah, speaking for The Nature Compact, pledged that the funds would be used strictly for their intended purposes and to deliver measurable impact.

In fact, during recent winter storms, when many gas and coal plants failed, solar and wind kept working.

With new advances in energy storage, we can now produce solar and wind power when it’s cheap and abundant and use it when we need it. Solar farms often take less than a year to build while gas power plants take up to seven years to start providing electricity.

Even worse, while wind and solar are a short and long-term solution to our power generation needs, building new gas plants and pipelines would lock us into this expensive and volatile energy source for 50 years or more, even as solar and wind continue to get less expensive.

This year, the North Carolina Justice Center officially took a stance against Transco’s proposed Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) set to come through the Triad because of “the likelihood of safety violations and incidents, based on Transco’s poor track record of compliance with Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations.”

For decades, taxpayers have been forced to subsidize the astronomical profits of Big Oil and Gas companies like Transco through subsidies, handouts, and sweetheart deals. Americans are then forced to bear the brunt of high energy prices, dirty water and air, public health risks, and the fallout from climate-driven disasters. Big Oil and Gas companies hid the truth about the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis for decades, while raking in unimaginable profits on the backs of consumers.

The gas for the proposed SSEP is set to fuel massive data centers in the Southeast, according to a new report from IEEFA. But growing electricity demand does not have to mean growing emissions, and transparency is critical, because data center projects and utility contracts are often proprietary, leading to the potential over-building of power plants and pipelines, causing stranded assets for utility customers to pay off over decades.

We know living near fossil fuel infrastructure, like pipelines, refineries and methane gas export facilities, causes a vast array of health problems. From asthma and cancer to premature death, oil and gas extraction and use is bad for quality of life. Not to mention that the SSEP would go near churches, schools, and dozens of houses and environmental justice communities.

On top of the direct health impacts, public health suffers as we deal with climate disasters caused by emissions from fossil fuel development. Injuries, death, and stressed health infrastructure contribute to poor health outcomes. Everyone suffers harm from this pollution, but vulnerable populations, like children and elderly people, pregnant women, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities are most at risk.

The gas industry continues to try and push a false narrative that its products are part of a clean energy solution instead of the risky and polluting reality that is fracked methane gas. The Trump administration has promised to push through fossil fuel projects without environmental reviews or considerations for how they will impact communities or prices.

The vast majority of people support increased access to clean, affordable energy instead of propping up polluting industries. We have a wide array of tools in our tool belt to not only fight, but win.

That is why five localities in the last six months in North Carolina have passed resolutions of concern or against SSEP. This is a no brainer to us. It’s time our leaders listened and acted by denying permits, so this dirty, dangerous pipeline won’t be constructed.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/transco-pipeline1765971647.png?h=c5eb578b&itok=Qk4XhF_T,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:20.050973

“I’m so grateful and ready to show my gratitude, and pay it forward.” Lashley was the college’s first Ph.D. student to enroll in 2022.
Since its introduction that year, the Ph.D. program has grown from 10 to 56 students, a 460 percent increase in three years.
“It’s the Aggie brand,” said Antoine Alston, Ph.D., associate CAES dean for academic studies.
“These gains show that the college is highly visible and highly committed to student success,” said Radiah C. Minor, Ph.D., interim CAES dean.","EAST GREENSBORO, N.C. (Dec. 17, 2025) – The North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES) celebrated a semester of success this fall, with record enrollment growth, a new double master’s degree pathway, a new dietetics concentration and the college’s first three-time graduate.

The first two Ph.D. graduates from the agribusiness and applied economics concentration, and first three graduates from the animal science concentration within the Agricultural and Environmental Sciences doctoral program, were among the 97 undergraduates, 34 master’s degree students and seven Ph.D. students who turned their tassels Dec. 12 and 13 at First Horizon Coliseum.

“I’m excited and happy … it’s not easy, but I did it,” said Success Okafor, who earned his Ph.D. from the agribusiness and applied economics concentration in the Department of Agribusiness, Applied Economics and Agriscience Education. “I’m happy for my colleagues as well as we graduate together.”

Joining them in earning his Ph.D. is Will Lashley, who made history in the college as its first three-time graduate. His Ph.D. is in agriculture and environmental sciences with a concentration in sustainable agriculture.

“It’s almost a surreal moment,” said Lashley, who previously received his bachelor’s degree in urban and community agriculture and a master’s in natural resources and environmental design. “I’m so grateful and ready to show my gratitude, and pay it forward.”

Lashley was the college’s first Ph.D. student to enroll in 2022. Since its introduction that year, the Ph.D. program has grown from 10 to 56 students, a 460 percent increase in three years.

That program’s growth mirrors the college’s, which enrolled its largest class this fall: 1,271 students, an increase of 118 students from Fall ‘24. The enrollment gains parallel those of the university, which this semester enrolled 15,275 students for the first time, a record not only for A&T but for historically Black college or universities (HBCUs) nationwide.

This is the 12th consecutive year A&T has been the nation’s largest public HBCU.

“It’s the Aggie brand,” said Antoine Alston, Ph.D., associate CAES dean for academic studies. “People understand that we represent high quality, innovation and community impact. We have a vision for the future of environmental sciences, food science and agriculture. People see that.”

That growth is fueling the university’s drive to achieve the Research 1 designation in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. CAES has intentionally overhauled its curriculum to reflect current issues and need-to-know trends in agriculture, food and nutritional science and other program areas, Alston said.

Chief among those new academic offerings is the “Ag MBA,” a new degree pathway jointly developed by CAES and the Willie A. Deese College of Business and Economics which allows students to earn two master’s degrees concurrently, one in business administration and one in agriculture and environmental systems. The program will enroll its first students in spring 2026.

“This is the only one of its kind in the country with this kind of structure and this curriculum,” said Alston. “This is going to allow students to save money and finish their degree at an accelerated pace.”

Another new academic offering is the nutrition and dietetics concentration in the food and nutritional sciences master’s program.

“The demand for dietitians is rising as people realize how important food and nutrition is to their overall health,” said Muditha Senanayake, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences.

The curriculum has provisionally been accepted for accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND), said interim program director June Thompson, RDN. Academy officials will visit the university next year to review the program for full accreditation.

“These gains show that the college is highly visible and highly committed to student success,” said Radiah C. Minor, Ph.D., interim CAES dean. “We equip our students with the knowledge, skills and dispositions that they need to be leaders and entrepreneurs. We are the college ‘where science meets society.’ We teach them to use that knowledge to go into the world and improve the human condition.”

The college’s student body also reflects a wide array of North Carolina counties, across the country and countries around the world

“There’s an experiential component to our college,” she said. “We make sure our students get the internships, have the study abroad experiences or community work and are able to create their own networks, making friends with people from across the country and the world. They take an expanded network with them after graduation.”",https://www.ncat.edu/news/2025/12/12_12_2025_graduate-commencement-017.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 08:59:14.342567

“Offshore wind is pivotal to achieving Net Zero by 2050 and driving growth as part of our Plan for Change.
Driving nature recovery and protecting the ecosystems that call Britain’s seas home is not a trade-off against clean energy, but a condition of delivery.","Enough electricity to power two cities the size of London will be unlocked through the Government’s new Marine Recovery Fund.

The landmark initiative is designed to protect Britain’s marine biodiversity while fast‑tracking the expansion of offshore wind, securing the UK’s long-term clean energy future.

The Marine Recovery Fund will allow offshore wind developers to contribute to a government‑run environmental funding pot, which will deliver large‑scale compensatory measures to restore and protect marine habitats. This strategic approach is expected to significantly reduce delays in the consenting process for new wind farms — a key barrier to offshore wind expansion in recent years.

Britain’s seas host some of the world’s most remarkable marine species, including seabirds, dolphins, porpoises and vital fish populations. The new fund will help extend existing Marine Protected Areas and designate new ones, safeguarding precious seabed habitats.

Future environmental measures are expected to include:

Controlling invasive species such as rats on islands to protect seabird colonies.

Creating offshore artificial nesting structures for kittiwakes.

Wider interventions to boost marine wildlife and support nature recovery at scale.

By pooling contributions from developers, the fund will enable coordinated, strategic environmental action rather than fragmented, site‑specific projects — delivering stronger ecological outcomes across the UK’s seas.

The new Marine Recovery Fund will unlock up to 19 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity in the near term. This will deliver the homegrown, affordable energy required to meet the Government’s ambition for clean power by 2030, reducing reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets and bolstering national energy security.

Offshore wind is central to the Government’s Plan for Change, supporting industrial revival and generating thousands of jobs across coastal communities and former industrial heartlands.

By establishing pre‑approved environmental compensation measures, the fund will:

Streamline planning and reduce lengthy case‑by‑case negotiations.

Speed up consenting decisions for new offshore wind farms.

Provide developers with clarity and confidence to invest at scale.

Ministers say the fund marks a major step forward in creating a planning and environmental regime that simultaneously accelerates renewable energy growth and restores marine ecosystems.

Marine Minister Emma Hardy commented:

“We’re building the next generation of clean, homegrown power and boosting marine life through the Marine Recovery Fund.

“Offshore wind is pivotal to achieving Net Zero by 2050 and driving growth as part of our Plan for Change. Driving nature recovery and protecting the ecosystems that call Britain’s seas home is not a trade-off against clean energy, but a condition of delivery.

“This approach creates a win-win by unlocking clean power through faster decisions and protecting our seas and extraordinary wildlife.”

With both nature recovery and energy security at its core, the Marine Recovery Fund is set to play a vital role in powering the UK’s clean energy transition while protecting the rich wildlife of Britain’s seas for generations to come.

The Roots of Lithium Mining in North Carolina

North Carolina has a rich historical context in lithium mining, dating back to the 20th century. The region’s Kings Mountain belt was one of the earliest zones for lithium extraction in the U.S., with mines initially focused on producing lithium for ceramics and industrial purposes. However, the activity remained limited and relatively small-scale as the global demand for lithium had not yet soared.

The discovery of spodumene and pegmatite mineral deposits added to the geological significance of the area. Recent exploration efforts have confirmed substantial lithium reserves in the region, revitalizing interest and positioning north carolina lithium mining as an essential part of the energy transition and critical minerals supply chain for the United States.

Washtenaw County residents are driving more overall, and that matters for holiday emissions. The Washtenaw Area Transportation Study (WATS) reports that Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) in the county rose 5% in 2023, reaching 3.81 billion miles (WATS 2023 Crash Report & Trends). This growth occurs even as Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County pursue aggressive climate goals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identifies transportation as the largest source of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions at 28% in 2022 (EPA Transportation Emissions). Reducing unnecessary holiday driving—by trip-chaining, consolidating family visits, or choosing nearer destinations—directly supports these local emission-reduction targets.

Residents can meaningfully reduce emissions by increasing vehicle occupancy and using transit where it exists. The Center for Sustainable Systems (CSS) at the University of Michigan reports that vehicle occupancy has fallen from 1.87 passengers per mile in 1977 to 1.5 in 2019, increasing per-person emissions (CSS Personal Transportation Factsheet). Meanwhile, WATS finds that 63.3% of Washtenaw County residents live within 0.5 miles of a fixed-route transit stop, and 70% of jobs are similarly close to transit (WATS Performance Measures). Carpooling to holiday gatherings, sharing rides with family, or using TheRide for local errands align directly with emissions-reduction strategies in Ann Arbor’s A2ZERO plan and the county’s Resilient Washtenaw framework.

Air travel carries a significant carbon footprint, and many Washtenaw County residents rely on flights to reach distant relatives. The CSS Carbon Footprint Factsheet states that commercial aircraft emitted 130.8 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent in 2022, and that an average domestic flight produces about 0.41 pounds of CO₂-equivalent per passenger-mile (CSS Carbon Footprint Factsheet). Since many local travelers fly through Detroit Metropolitan Airport or other regional hubs, choosing nonstop flights where possible reduces the number of takeoff/landing cycles—typically the most fuel-intensive parts of any flight—and lowers total trip emissions in a documented, measurable way.

Train and bus alternatives, where available, often outperform flights on a per-passenger-mile basis—and may help Washtenaw travelers reduce holiday impacts. Global mode-comparison data from Our World in Data show that rail and coach travel emit significantly less CO₂-equivalent per passenger-kilometer than short-haul flights (Our World in Data – Travel Carbon Footprint). For Washtenaw County residents traveling to cities connected by rail or intercity buses—Detroit, Chicago, Toledo, Grand Rapids, and others—choosing these modes can provide meaningful emission reductions. When feasible, avoiding short-hop flights aligns with both the A2ZERO and Resilient Washtenaw transportation-reduction goals.

Cleaner vehicle choices and efficient driving habits offer immediate emission reductions for Washtenaw drivers. Lifecycle analysis from CSS shows that small SUVs emit 429 g CO₂-equivalent per mile in gasoline models, compared with 312 g for plug-in hybrids, 258 g for hybrids, and 267 g for battery-electric vehicles (CSS Personal Transportation Factsheet). The same factsheet notes that aggressive driving and high speeds can reduce fuel economy by 10–40%, increasing emissions. For Washtenaw County households making annual winter trips—within Michigan or across the Midwest—choosing a more efficient vehicle and driving at moderate speeds directly reduces holiday-travel emissions and supports local climate targets.

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU, and we're just a week away from Christmas Eve now. And for the fortunate among those who celebrate, it's a time for family and friends and long-awaited get-togethers. I'm David Fair, and welcome to 89.1 WEMU's Issues of the Environment. Now, you might ask. What do the holidays have to do with the environment? Well, some will be traveling to be with loved ones. Others will have family travel here to be with you. Travel has a huge impact on the health of our environment, and that's what we're going to discuss today. Our expert guest is Greg Keoleian. He serves as co-director of the University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Systems. And a happy holiday season to you, Greg! I appreciate your time!

Greg Keoleian: You have a nice holiday too, David, and look forward to talking to you!

David Fair: Well, with all of the gatherings we're going to have locally throughout the state, country, and world for that matter, what kind of impact does this heavy kind of travel have on our environment?

Greg Keoleian: Well, transportation accounts for 30% of the energy consumption in the United States and 28% of the greenhouse gas emissions. That is travel including moving people, personal transportation, as well as moving stuff or goods. The light duty vehicles, in terms of transportation, this is over half of those impacts in terms of energy and emissions. But then, of course for holidays, there's a lot of travel by air for long distance.

David Fair: Can we distill those impacts down to what happens right here in Washtenaw County?

Greg Keoleian: So, we actually did a study of the greenhouse gas impacts of gas-powered vehicles and compared them with hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles, and looked at the full life cycle in terms of the emissions with producing the vehicle, using the vehicle, and retiring the vehicle. And we found that, national average, there's a 75% reduction if you compare a battery electric vehicle with a comparable, bivehicle-type, gas-powered vehicle. So, that's a tremendous improvement, in terms of environmental impact.

David Fair: We consistently hear how we are approaching or might even be at an environmental climate tipping point. Can we continue to travel the way that we do without pushing ourselves over the edge?

Greg Keoleian: No. We need to make some fundamental changes, because, as you know, we need to reduce our emissions down to zero by 2050. And 2030, we should be half of our emissions, and we're not on track with that right now. We actually did a study looking at if we had 50% sales of battery electric vehicles in 2030, would we be on that trajectory to hit to zero by 2050? And we're pretty close, but we're not on track with 50% sales of new vehicles being battery electric. So, there's a lot we need to do. And I think the recent actions in Washington are not helping that, in terms of taking away the EV tax credit and some other policies that may be setting us back. But that really shifts it to us individuals, in terms of what actions we could take, and there's a lot we can do.

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU and our Issues of the Environment conversation with Greg Keoleian continues. He serves as co-director of the University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Systems. And before we talk about how we can do things on an individual basis, I want to talk economics for a moment. There's a cost to implementing sustainability measures and advancing our technologies to try and better adapt to our environmental realities. While we slowly work toward that end, do we have a handle on what it will cost us longer-term by not moving more quickly?

Greg Keoleian: Yes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been tracking the cost and damages from billion-dollar weather and climate disasters. They've been doing this for the last 40 years. The impacts are increasing in intensity and frequency from climate pollution. And that includes flooding, wildfires, droughts, heat stress. And just last year alone, it was $183 billion of damage. And I think us in Michigan, one thing that we observed was the wildfire smoke or experience, which was really awful. Those events are going to continue to increase in frequency and intensity. And that's why we need to take action to limit our emissions from transportation.

David Fair: As we explore the economics of future transportation and mobility, many people are already being priced out of air travel. The cost of new vehicles is becoming prohibitive for many, and they've already been priced out of much of the market. It has implications on a multitude of levels. What is going to be required of the transportation industry itself to keep people on the road and in the air while also protecting jobs and adequately stewarding a program of environmental responsibility?

Greg Keoleian: Well, one thing is public transit is generally more affordable than ownership. And when it comes to vehicle ownership, we have done research on the total cost of ownership of vehicles, so that's the purchase, the fuel, the insurance, the maintenance. And we're finding that, with electrified vehicles, they're coming close in parity to gas-powered vehicles, and that's because there's tremendous savings in the operation of the vehicles. And new vehicles are very difficult, particularly for low-income families. 70% of vehicle purchases are used, and we're just finishing up a study now on used vehicles and finding that the total cost of ownership is very favorable compared to new vehicles. They're depreciating a little bit more. And so, we're finding that buying a a used electrified vehicle three to five years old can really help lower costs. Now, of course, one needs to look at charging and is there the ability to have access to charging infrastructure. And ideally, you would have home charging because public charging is at least twice the cost of home charging.

David Fair: Our Issues of the Environment conversation with U of M Center for Sustainable Systems. co-director Greg Keoleian continues on 89.1 WEMU. So, let's talk further about responsibility, and you pointed out we each have a role in this. As we approach this particular holiday travel season, what are some of the things we can do to reduce our personal carbon footprint when we go to visit family and friends and then carry that on through the rest of the year?

Greg Keoleian: Sure. I mean, one of the biggest things we could do is reduce the travel distance, so that's your vehicle miles traveled. And that, obviously, if you're visiting family, unless you're going do it virtually, which is not something you're necessarily going want to share your holiday dinner with virtually, that doesn't work, or bringing gifts that doesn't work. But, yeah, just in general we're reducing distance, but one can reduce impact by carpooling, bundling trips if you're visiting. Instead of doing individual trips, you bundle trips. The other is choosing the right vehicle if you're going to be driving a car and you have different vehicles in your household. So, that's, in general, something you want to do is match the vehicle with the trips. Commuting to work, you don't do that in a big SUV, you would do that in a sedan. Individually is purchase a battery electric vehicle, as I mentioned, there's dramatic reductions in emissions and also cost of fueling.

David Fair: You know, America's built on many things, and one of the underdiscussed characteristics is our unquenched desire for more and more convenience. Changing our mobility and our environmental future is going to require behavioral, attitudinal, and political changes, and I'm not sure that climate adaptation and cleaner air and water are sufficient impetus to get us there. What do you think it's going to take to finally move the needle to where it needs to be?

Greg Keoleian: Well, I think I agree with you that climate may not be on a top priority on people's decision-making about purchasing vehicles or how they travel. But I will say that these events--these extreme events--are becoming more and more frequent, and I think climate pollution is becoming more visible. And so, I think that is going to motivate people. But I think the other is there is a shift in transformation, in terms of how we're moving. Many younger people, for example, aren't owning cars. They're living closer to where they're work in urban centers. The transition, with regard to electric vehicles--now it's stalled a bit because of what's happened in Washington. But the performance of electrified vehicles is actually, I think, going to help accelerate that transition because they're quieter, they have good acceleration, there's no tailpipe pollution, and the costs are going to be really better than gas-powered vehicles because battery costs are coming down dramatically. And, again, the charging with electricity is less than filling up your tank with gasoline. So, I think just the technology is improving. That's also going to help us. But then, again, we need to look at taking advantage of other modes. Like, getting to the airport from Ann Arbor, there's a bus that we could take. If I want to get to Tiger Stadium, I could take a a bus from Ann Arbor directly to Detroit and just walk a couple of blocks, and I'm at the stadium. So, really take advantage of some of these opportunities. It's really recommended.

David Fair: Well, I'm glad I got to take advantage of your time and have the conversation today! I appreciate it! And a happy holiday season to you and yours!

Greg Keoleian: You too! I really enjoy talking with you, David! And you have a great program! We really appreciate it!
