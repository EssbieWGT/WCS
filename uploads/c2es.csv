“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.
Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.","There were some highs amid a lot of lows in a roller coaster year for clean energy as President Donald Trump worked to boost polluting fuels while blocking wind and solar, according to dozens of energy developers, experts and politicians.

Surveyed by The Associated Press, many described 2025 as turbulent and challenging for clean energy, though there was progress as projects connected to the electric grid. They said clean energy must continue to grow to meet skyrocketing demand for electricity to power data centers and to lower Americans’ utility bills.

Solar builder and operator Jorge Vargas said it has been “a very tough year for clean energy” as Trump often made headlines criticizing renewable energy and Republicans muscled a tax and spending cut bill through Congress in July that dramatically rolled back tax breaks for clean energy.

“There was a cooldown effect this year,” said Vargas, cofounder and CEO of Aspen Power. “Having said that, we are a resilient industry.”

Plug Power president Jose Luis Crespo said the developments — both policy recalibration and technological progress — will shape clean energy’s trajectory for years to come.

Energy policy whiplash in 2025

Much of clean energy’s fate in 2025 was driven by booster Joe Biden’s exit from the White House.

The year began with ample federal subsidies for clean energy technologies, a growing number of U.S.-based companies making parts and materials for projects and a lot of demand from states and corporations, said Tom Harper, partner at global consultant Baringa.

It ends with subsidies stripped back, a weakened supply chain, higher costs from tariffs and some customers questioning their commitment to clean energy, Harper said. He described the year as “paradigm shifting.”

Trump called wind and solar power “the scam of the century” and vowed not to approve new projects. The federal government canceled grants for hundreds of projects.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022. Wayne Winegarden, at the Pacific Research Institute think tank, said the time has come for alternative energy to demonstrate viability without subsidies. ( Fossil fuels also receive subsidies.)

Many energy executives said this was the most consequential policy shift. The bill reshaped the economics of clean energy projects, drove a rush to start construction before incentives expire and forced developers to reassess their strategies for acquiring parts and materials, Lennart Hinrichs said. He leads the expansion of TWAICE in the Americas, providing analytics software for battery energy storage systems.

Companies can’t make billion-dollar investments with so much policy uncertainty, said American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet.

Consequently, greenhouse gas emissions will fall at a much lower rate than previously projected in the U.S., said Brian Murray, director of the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University.

Still, solar and battery storage are booming

Solar and storage accounted for 85% of the new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump administration, according to Wood Mackenzie research.

That’s because the economics remain strong, demand is high and the technologies can be deployed quickly, said Mike Hall, CEO of Anza Renewables.

Solar energy company Sol Systems said it had a record year as it brought its largest utility-scale project online and grew its business. The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. “The direction is still all good.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association said that no matter the policies in Washington, solar and storage will grow as the backbone of the nation’s energy future.

Nuclear and geothermal had a good year, too

Democrats and Republicans have supported investing to keep nuclear reactors online, restart previously closed reactors and deploy new, advanced reactor designs. Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity, though not typically labeled as green energy like other renewables.

“Who had ‘restart Three Mile Island’ on their 2025 Bingo card?” questioned Baringa partner David Shepheard. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The Energy Department is loaning $1 billion to help finance a restart.

Everyone loves nuclear, said Darrin Kayser, executive vice president at Edelman. It helps that the technology for small, modular reactors is starting to come to fruition, Kayser added.

Benton Arnett, a senior director at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that as the need for clean, reliable power intensifies, “we will look back on the actions being taken now as laying the foundation.”

The Trump administration also supports geothermal energy, and the tax bill largely preserved geothermal tax credits. The Geothermal Rising association said technologies continue to mature and produce, making 2025 a breakthrough year.

Offshore wind had a terrible year

Momentum for offshore wind in the United States came to a grinding halt just as the industry was starting to gain traction, said Joey Lange, a senior managing director at Trio, a global sustainability and energy advisory company.

The Trump administration stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped federal funding for offshore wind projects.

That has decimated the projects, developers and tech innovators, and no one in wind is raising or spending capital, said Eric Fischgrund, founder and CEO at FischTank PR. Still, Fischgrund said he remains optimistic because the world is transitioning to cleaner energy.

More clean energy needed in 2026

An energy strategy with a diverse mix of sources is the only way forward as demand grows from data centers and other sources, and as people demand affordable, reliable electricity, said former Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.

Experts expect solar and battery storage to continue growing in 2026 to add a lot of power to the grid quickly and cheaply. The market will continue to ensure that most new electricity is renewable, said Amanda Levin, policy analysis director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, thinks offshore wind will still play an important role too. It is both ready and needed to help address the demand for electricity in the new year, which will become increasingly clear “to all audiences,” she said. Turn Forward advocates for offshore wind.

That skyrocketing demand “is shaking up the political calculus that drove the administration’s early policy decisions around renewables,” she said.

BlueWave CEO Sean Finnerty thinks that states, feeling the pressure to deliver affordable, reliable electricity, will increasingly drive clean energy momentum in 2026 by streamlining permitting and the process of connecting to the grid, and by reducing costs for things like permits and fees.

Ed Gunn, Lunar Energy’s vice president for revenue, said the industry has weathered tough years before.

“The fundamentals are unchanged,” Gunn said, “there is massive value in clean energy.”

The signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB Act) by President Donald Trump on 4 July marks a pivotal shift in the United States’ climate and energy trajectory.

The sweeping legislation dismantles much of the clean energy incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while expanding support for fossil fuel activities.

The act radically alters tax credit timelines and access, setting off a rush among developers to start construction before new deadlines in 2025 and 2026.

Redwood Materials Inc., a battery recycling venture led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel, has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply badly needed critical materials.

The company has brought a system online that’s capable of recovering 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, said Straubel. Initially founded to fill a gap in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, Redwood is in the midst of a broader shift in strategy as it navigates an expected slowdown in EV demand.

The pivot also comes at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing to onshore the supply chain for materials essential to US national security.

Taking into account Redwood’s existing recycling plant in Sparks, Nevada, which recovers 60,000 tons of critical minerals annually, the firm says it is now the only major domestic source of cobalt and produces as much nickel and lithium as the largest mines in the US.

The South Carolina facility isn’t operating at full capacity, and the company declined to set a ramp-up timeline. It also declined to provide a breakdown of how much of each mineral it’s recovering at the facility.

Redwood was founded in 2017 to recycle EV batteries and produce materials like cathodes and copper foils for anodes. The company had said in 2022 that it planned to produce enough materials for a million EVs annually by 2025 and 5 million by 2030, and it had agreements with Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo, among others.

Yet its commercial cathode production facility in Nevada, which was slated to open in 2024 and produce 100 gigawatt-hours of battery components by this year, is still under construction with no announced opening date. While the company had planned to expand copper foil production at both of its facilities, it stopped producing it in Nevada and no longer plans to do so in South Carolina.

The industry has also faced challenges from the Trump administration, which recently canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to other battery recyclers. With the administration’s attacks on EVs further impacting the industry, including winding down federal incentives in September, Redwood has increased its focus on finding other buyers. The bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the EV sector, Straubel said.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel said.

Nickel is used in stainless steel; specialty alloys, or a custom metal blend for niche applications; and industrial chemicals, while cobalt is also used in a number of high-performance alloys like those found in jet engines. While he declined to name them, Straubel said Redwood sells its critical minerals to about 20 to 30 companies, including large industrial customers using the materials in products and mining companies that process and refine them.

The company has also shifted its focus to serving data centers’ burgeoning power demand, starting a new unit this year called Redwood Energy that turns degraded EV batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. Retired EV batteries can still work for large-scale energy storage because those systems put less strain on the hardware. In June, it unveiled a modest 63 megawatt-hour system – the equivalent of about 800 EV battery packs – paired with 12 megawatts of solar on its Nevada campus, powering a 2,000 GPU data center.

Redwood raised a $350 million Series E at a valuation of more than $6 billion last month in part to speed up energy storage deployment. That side of the business is “growing faster” and is “a new focus that we didn’t really know we were going to have a few years ago,” Straubel said.

But if an administration is defined by what it does, this White House has been anything but transparent and accessible.

In February, the Trump administration barred AP reporters and photographers from covering White House events for not obeying the president’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. A federal court declared the banishment a violation of the organization’s free speech rights.

In September, the Department of Defense required journalists to sign a document promising not to use any material, classified or unclassified, that was not approved for publication by officials. Those who refused lost physical access to the Pentagon. A lawsuit by The New York Times claims the policy prevents “scrutiny by independent news organizations for the public benefit,” in violation of the 1st Amendment.

In December, the Inspector General for the Pentagon found that by sharing information on an unsecure messaging app about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth risked the safety of U.S. forces. Hegseth refused to sit for an interview with Inspector General Steven Stebbins. In a written statement, Hegseth said he had a right to declassify the information but did not indicate that he had done so. A Pentagon official claimed the report constituted “a total exoneration.”

Not coincidentally, President Trump himself has broken with historic norms, by firing 17 inspectors general, leaving 75 percent of presidentially appointed inspector general positions vacant, and blocking funds appropriated by Congress for the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The administration, which has been slow to respond to Freedom of Information requests, is apparently about to impose a rule ending long-standing legal protection for whistleblowers employed by the federal government.

Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Department of Justice to release Office of Legal Counsel documents arguing that airstrikes on alleged drug smugglers are legal. “Prompt disclosure of these records,” the plaintiffs assert, “is critically important to ensuring informed public disclosure about the U.S. military’s unprecedented strikes.”

Legal experts, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and some U.S. military personnel have expressed concerns that drug trafficking doesn’t meet accepted definitions of threats to national security, armed conflict or foreign terrorism. Smugglers haven’t attacked U.S. citizens, have due process rights, and aren’t subject to a death penalty; the alleged list of targets reportedly includes cartels not heretofore designated as terrorist organizations; and most drugs enter the United States through Mexico. Because the U.S. is not in an armed conflict with drug traffickers, critics believe the strikes constitute “extrajudicial killings” — or, more simply, murder.

Nonetheless, the Pentagon has rebuffed requests from members of Congress to review the OLC opinion. The Constitution, U.S. Army general counsel Charles Young maintains, gives the president discretion over releasing information. Young didn’t explain why Trump didn’t exercise that discretion as part of his commitment to transparency.

Asked whether he supported releasing the unedited video of the second strike on a boat that killed two shipwrecked survivors on Sept. 2, Trump replied, “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have, we’d certainly release, no problem.” A few days later, he asserted, “I didn’t say that. That is ABC fake news.” He then attacked the “obnoxious” reporter who asked him about it. This week, Secretary Hegseth said he would not publicly release the full video.

We have seen this movie before. As he pleaded for the administration to be “as transparent as possible” on the airstrikes, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) made the connection explicit: “We’ve got to release the video. Look, we [also] have to get the Epstein files released.”

Asked in June 2024 whether he would declassify the controversial Epstein files if re-elected as president, Trump, who knew that MAGA influencers including Elon Musk, Laura Loomer, Alex Jones and Kash Patel were leading the charge, said “yeah, yeah, I would.” In September, he repeated, “I’d do the Epstein. I’d have no problem with it.”

In February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi declared Epstein files were “sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump.” She then released “the first phase” of documents, most of them already in the public domain.

Trump then changed his mind. Bondi said there was “no client list.” Fake news networks, Democrats and “soft and foolish Republicans,” the president claimed, were focusing on “this creep” to undermine his agenda.

The files , he said, “were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by Biden.” The FBI should investigate other things, like voter fraud, and “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein.” A lot of people “could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said. While insisting, “I don’t care about it, released or not,” he pressured Republicans in the House to refuse to sign or withdraw their names from a discharge petition requiring a vote on a bill compelling the Justice Department to release all the files.

When that effort failed, Trump took credit for telling Republicans to do what they had already decided to do: “Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous.”

“President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files for years,” a White House spokesperson asserted, and calling for “investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”

Once upon a time, Trump appeared to be a born-again proponent of transparency. His lack of faith, however, has been far more frequent, long-lasting and consequential.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

As Brussels continues to refine its industrial and climate agenda, the warning from one of Europe’s largest automakers points to the stakes.
For companies like Stellantis, the challenge is not only adapting to new technologies, but deciding whether Europe remains a place where long-term automotive investment makes economic and strategic sense.","Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa has issued a blunt warning that the European Union’s latest package of measures for the auto industry could undermine long-term investment in the region, deepening uncertainty for manufacturers already under pressure from weak demand, high costs, and intensifying global competition.

Speaking to the Financial Times in an interview published on Saturday, Filosa said the proposals unveiled by the European Commission earlier this week lack the urgency and coherence needed to revive growth in Europe’s automotive sector, which remains one of the bloc’s most strategically important industries.

“There are none of the urgent measures needed to return the European automotive sector to growth,” Filosa said. “Without growth, it becomes very difficult to think about investing more.”

The Commission’s plan, announced on Tuesday, includes a controversial shift on climate policy by effectively dropping the EU’s planned ban on the sale of new combustion-engine cars from 2035.

The move has exposed deep divisions within the industry and among policymakers. While some automakers and member states argue that easing the rule offers breathing space amid slowing electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure gaps, others fear it dilutes regulatory clarity and weakens Europe’s credibility in the global transition to cleaner transport.

For Stellantis, which operates 14 brands including Peugeot, Fiat, Opel, Citroën, Jeep, and Alfa Romeo, the concern goes beyond the fate of internal combustion engines. Filosa framed the issue as one of strategic certainty and industrial confidence, arguing that frequent policy shifts make it harder for companies to commit capital to European factories, suppliers, and innovation hubs.

He said that without sustained and predictable investment, Europe risks losing its ability to build a resilient automotive supply chain, something he linked directly to employment, competitiveness, and security.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

In an official statement released after the Commission’s announcement, Stellantis said the proposals failed to tackle several structural challenges facing the sector. The company pointed to the absence of a clear and comprehensive roadmap for light commercial vehicles, a segment that underpins logistics, trades, and small businesses across the continent. It also criticized the lack of flexibility around the EU’s 2030 emissions targets for passenger cars, which it said do not adequately reflect market realities or consumer affordability concerns.

The criticism comes at a delicate moment for Europe’s car industry. Automakers are grappling with slowing vehicle sales, stubbornly high energy and labor costs, and fierce competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, many of which benefit from lower production costs and strong state backing. At the same time, European manufacturers are being asked to fund multiple transitions at once: electrification, software-driven vehicles, autonomous technologies, and ever-stricter environmental and safety standards.

Industry executives have repeatedly argued that regulation alone cannot drive the transition. They have called for stronger demand-side measures, including purchase incentives, accelerated deployment of charging infrastructure, and policies to lower the cost of energy and raw materials. Without such support, they warn, consumers will delay purchases and manufacturers will struggle to justify large-scale investments.

The contrast with other regions has become increasingly stark. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has unlocked billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles, batteries, and clean manufacturing, attracting major investment from global automakers and suppliers. Filosa’s remarks echo a growing concern among European executives that capital could increasingly flow to markets offering clearer incentives and more stable policy frameworks.

While the Commission has argued that its revised approach aims to balance climate goals with industrial competitiveness, Stellantis’ response highlights fears that the package delivers neither decisively. Easing the 2035 combustion-engine deadline may reduce near-term pressure, but Filosa suggested that without a credible growth strategy, it risks prolonging uncertainty rather than resolving it.

Looking Toward a Sustainable Future Radiant Nuclear’s microreactors hold promise for a more sustainable energy future.","Radiant Nuclear, based in El Segundo, California, is making significant strides in the nuclear energy sector with its 1-MW microreactors. The company recently secured $300 million to advance its commercialization efforts and is planning to establish a reactor factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, by 2026. This facility aims to produce 50 Kaleidos microreactors annually, with shipments to customers beginning in 2028. With over half a billion dollars in funding, Radiant is positioning itself as a key player in the competitive race to deliver compact nuclear reactors, leveraging advanced technology and strategic partnerships.

Revolutionizing Energy with Microreactors

The Kaleidos microreactor represents a breakthrough in portable nuclear energy technology. Designed to be compact and highly efficient, each reactor is equipped with TRISO fuel—ceramic-coated uranium particles that ensure safety and stability by preventing meltdowns. The use of helium cooling systems further enhances the reactor’s operational safety. This innovative approach allows the reactors to adapt to varying energy demands while maintaining real-time performance monitoring.

These reactors are delivered fully assembled, fueled, and tested, ready to generate power the day after arrival. Capable of producing 1.9 MW of thermal power, they are ideal for industrial heating applications. The ability to daisy chain multiple units creates scalable power solutions for diverse settings, from remote communities to disaster areas. This flexibility makes them a viable alternative to traditional diesel generators.

Strategic Partnerships and Market Expansion

Radiant Nuclear is actively forming strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. The company recently signed an agreement to supply a US military base with a Kaleidos reactor by 2028. Additionally, a deal with Equinix, a major data center operator, will see dozens of reactors deployed to support energy-intensive facilities. These partnerships underscore the potential for microreactors to transform energy supply chains and enhance energy security.

Next year, the Kaleidos will undergo a fueled test using high-assay low-enriched uranium, marking a significant milestone as the first new commercial reactor design to be tested in the US in over five decades. Radiant’s exclusive access to this advanced fuel positions it advantageously in a competitive market. The planned demonstration at Idaho National Laboratory’s DOME research facility will further validate the reactor’s capabilities.

But as temperatures rise, this quintessential winter holiday scene is transforming (in the Northern Hemisphere at least). The snowstorm you were picturing is actually more likely to be a chilly rain in many areas. Cocoa crops around the world are failing, making chocolate drinks and desserts increasingly expensive. Global warming is even coming for Rudolph, recent research shows.

Climate change is threatening Christmas and winter traditions – and in some cases, holiday trends are fueling it.

Christmas Crops

Holiday spirit in December is underpinned by a multitude of global supply chains churning throughout the year. And I'm not just talking about markets that support presents like clothes and electronics; many of the most lucrative Christmas commodities are grown.

Take chocolate: As many as 6 million small-holder farmers in Africa, Asia and Latin America grow and harvest 90 percent of the world's cocoa, which go into all sorts of holiday classics – from yule log cakes to marshmallow-topped cocoa. Cacao, the plant that is processed to make cocoa, thrives in tropical climates with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall. But in 2023 and 2024, the weather was too warm and wet – then too dry – in African countries like Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana for healthy cacao crops. Yields plummeted to record lows.

This extreme weather was caused partially by the El Niño weather pattern. But an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central found that human-caused climate change added six weeks' worth of days above 89 degrees Fahrenheit in 71 percent of cacao-producing areas across much of West Africa in 2024. The low output led to staggeringly high chocolate prices around the world, surging from about $2,500 to more than $10,000 per metric ton that year.

Though prices have since fallen a bit, scientists at Harvard University say this cocoa volatility likely represents a ""new normal."" Unpredictable weather is affecting other holiday baking necessities like sugarcane and cinnamon crops – both essential for any snickerdoodle fan.

Long-term temperature rise and compounding weather disasters are also hurting the most iconic holiday crop: Christmas trees. As I reported in January, Oregon and North Carolina produce the most Christmas trees in the United States, but warmer winters and longer growing seasons are leading to stunted growth and a surge in pest outbreaks that can decimate supplies.

""When we grow Christmas trees, we typically are taking them out of their natural habitat, particularly with Fraser fir,"" Justin Whitehill, a forestry researcher at North Carolina State University who studies Christmas trees, told me a year ago.

""Taking them out of their sort of natural range, we're already putting a lot of stress on them,"" and climate-fueled warming only adds to that, he added. Whitehill and other scientists – including an entire Christmas tree program at Oregon State University – are experimenting with new breeds or genetic modifications to help make the trees more resistant to pests and heat.

Pro tip: Researchers also told me that once the holiday season is over, you can donate your natural Christmas tree (after you've removed the ornaments and tinsel) to wildlife agencies around the country. They use them to help provide crucial habitats for freshwater fish.

Climate Scrooge

The subjects of some of the most famous Christmas carols are also at risk as global temperatures rise. Reindeer – also known as caribou in North America – face over a 50 percent decline by the end of the century due to climate-fueled habitat loss and overheating, according to a study published in August.

These antlered creatures thrive in Arctic habitats such as tundra and boreal forests, where they help maintain vegetation and plant diversity. Using fossils and ancient DNA, researchers simulated how warming events over the past 21,000 years affected reindeer populations to help predict how they will do in the future under different warming scenarios.

They found that modern-day rates of temperature rise could decimate reindeer populations more than any of those in the past.

""Continued losses will likely further exacerbate climatic warming through release of soil carbon to the atmosphere, which, of course, would further threaten reindeer and caribou, as well as ourselves,"" study co-author Eric Post, a professor at the University of California, Davis, said in a statement. ""For thousands of years, the well-being of our own species has benefited directly from healthy reindeer and caribou populations. Now more than ever, we need to ensure their well-being in turn.""

Meanwhile, Frosty the Snowman and the white Christmas you may be dreaming of are also disappearing amid rapid warming. The chances of having at least one inch of snow on Christmas Day – the metric for what the National Weather Service deems a ""white Christmas"" – are ""gradually decreasing across the Southern United States, and this trend is slowly moving north,"" according to the federal government. It's important to note that snow was never that common on Christmas Day for many states, Time magazine reports.

""People tend to remember that one snowy Christmas, and they forget that it was surrounded by five Christmases that weren't,"" David Robinson, New Jersey's state climatologist and a Rutgers University professor whose research focuses on snow cover, told Time.

But records reveal a clear trend of warming winters overall, with average temperatures rising nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit in almost 250 U.S. cities since 1970, according to an analysis of federal data by Climate Central. Holiday shopping may be accelerating this trend, with millions of emissions generated each year due to product manufacturing, packaging, shipping and waste.

It doesn't end there: Roughly 15 percent of purchases made during the holiday season are returned. I reported on this ""reverse supply chain"" last year and was shocked to learn how returns' carbon pollution compares to that of the initial deliveries.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/hot_chocolate_climate.76af3cfb.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 09:58:40.285290

LIMÓN INDANZA, Ecuador—Long drifts of mist settle between the mountain peaks in this region, almost indistinguishable from clouds. Underneath, species found only here depend on the intricacies of this high-altitude rainforest, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet.

Like many parts of the Amazon, this fragile and abundant wilderness is imperiled—and not only by the usual dangers of development and climate change. Mounting sovereign debt has become one of the Ecuadorian Amazon’s biggest threats, pushing the government to expand oil and mining to keep public finances afloat.

Ecuador owes $49 billion to foreign creditors and is paying billions more just to service the debt that instead could be spent on urgently needed environmental protections.

But today, an effort is underway that could transform this liability into a tool for conservation. In 2024, through a deal known as a debt-for-nature swap, the Ecuadorian government was able to refinance some of its costliest, privately held debt for pennies on the dollar and replace it with a lower-interest, longer-maturity bond. In return, Ecuador agreed to expand protections across its Amazonian region, which spans about half the country.

Debt swaps—for nature, development projects and more—are not new. Western creditors have been experimenting with versions of them since the 1980s. In recent years, countries such as Seychelles and Barbados have executed deals with private creditors like commercial banks, mobilizing hundreds of millions of dollars for conservation. Now, a small chorus of academics and policy thinkers is looking beyond traditional lenders to one with massive and untapped leverage: China.

Through its $1.3 trillion Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has become the world’s largest bilateral creditor by financing mines, ports, power plants and infrastructure in countries across the developing world. China’s opaque lending practices make it difficult to know exactly how much these countries owe, but experts say it could exceed hundreds of billions of dollars.

Those massive figures caught the attention of economist and China expert Christoph Nedopil Wang, who was among the first researchers to see an opportunity in them. In 2021, he and his colleagues wrote a paper advancing the idea that China could help countries redirect some of that debt into conservation efforts.

China took notice. The central bank’s Green Finance Committee commissioned Nedopil Wang to do a special study on the topic, as did the United Nations Development Programme. And while Beijing has yet to do a debt-for-nature deal, it’s discussing another form of debt swap with Egypt and other increasingly sophisticated financial transactions to alleviate debt.

Rebecca Ray, an economist at Boston University who is among the pioneering thinkers on China and debt swaps, argues such new approaches are overdue. “One cyclone can wipe out multiple years of export earnings, and that kind of climate shock is making debt crises more common,” she said.

China’s Belt and Road spending spree has unlocked development funding for cash-strapped countries like Ecuador but has also left behind a trail of environmental destruction while contributing to ballooning debt burdens further strained by rising interest rates and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the world’s poorest countries, many of which owe debt to China, spend twice as much servicing debt as they receive in climate funding. Unless debt burdens ease, the financial pressure on those countries could drive them toward greater resource extraction, further imperiling some of the most critical ecosystems on Earth.

Supporters of Chinese participation in debt-for-nature swaps say the model offers a way to relieve some of that burden while redirecting Beijing’s influence toward repairing the landscapes its projects damaged.

Proponents view these deals as win-wins, but some environmental economists and scholars remain deeply skeptical. They note Beijing’s reluctance to write off debt for fear of triggering demands for similar treatment from other borrowers, and say other creditors like multilateral development banks and private debt holders—which, collectively, hold the majority of most developing countries’ external debt—should be first in line to take a loss.

“China feels, from its perspective, ‘Why should we be the ones?’” said Elizabeth Losos, executive in residence at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability. “They don’t want to set a precedent.”

The flip side, she noted, is that China is carrying a portfolio of borrowers that aren’t able to pay back their debts on time. Many have been forced to roll over their loans, reducing the debt’s ultimate value. In that context, accepting an immediate payment rather than uncertain payments in the future—while also accruing geopolitical goodwill at a moment when the United States is retreating from climate and environmental cooperation—may be the more strategic choice, Losos said.

For now, China’s willingness to use its financial clout for conservation or other sustainable development goals remains uncertain. Even if Beijing were to embrace debt swaps more broadly, its environmental legacy across many Belt and Road countries raises doubts.

In Ecuador, Chinese firms have dammed rivers, mined mountains and drilled pristine rainforest. That track record makes it hard for many Ecuadorians to imagine China as a sudden champion of global conservation.

Julio Prieto, a Quito-based environmental lawyer, recently sued a Chinese firm over a sprawling waste pit at one of its mines. Along with civil society groups, Prieto has criticized Chinese companies for steamrolling over local objections in communities where it has built major projects. He questions China’s will to establish a complex conservation deal that would respect human rights.

“If the Chinese government and Chinese companies are not willing to be transparent about something as basic as their construction plans,” Prieto said, “I’d be surprised if they were open to taking a fundamentally different approach on debt swaps.”

Leaning In

When Nedopil Wang first contemplated a China-backed debt swap, the reaction from many China watchers at the time was dismissive: “‘OK, you’re crazy. What even is this?’” he recalled them saying.

Beijing’s interest was clearly piqued. The powerful Ministry of Commerce, responsible for overseas development assistance, conducted its own research and Chinese officials began showing up to Nedopil Wang’s presentations. Yet, what the Communist Party’s top leadership ultimately thinks of those ideas remains unknowable.

“It’s a fantastically closed system,” Nedopil Wang said.

But China’s debt-swap discussion with Egypt suggests Beijing is at least interested in testing the idea.

In 2023, the countries opened negotiations to swap some of Cairo’s $8 billion debt to China for interest-free loans financing a broad sweep of projects, including renewable energy and healthcare development. Ray calls this trial run “China’s proof of concept.”

Nedopil Wang explained that Egypt approached China and said, “Here’s an opportunity for you as a creditor to support our development through swaps.” he said the details of the deal are still unclear. “It remains to be seen how it’s going to be applied, but it seems the focus is on interest-free debt,” he added.

Negotiators rarely disclose details of debt swaps in advance because any information surrounding a possible deal could influence financial markets. But policy analysts have identified a slate of countries as strong candidates for Chinese debt restructuring.

Pakistan is a key example. China has become its largest creditor after kicking off a massive project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. One of the central pillars of the Belt and Road Initiative, it aims to secure road and water routes from western China to the Middle East and has fast-tracked the construction of seven coal-fired power plants, with another planned. Pakistan owes China just under $30 billion—more than any other country.

“Pakistan has such a high debt level where China plays such a big, big role, and there are multiple underperforming assets that make the debt payment sometimes difficult,” Nedopil Wang explained. “There’s also a huge opportunity to do … a debt-for-renewables swap in this case. So I think this is a space to watch.”

The Chinese-backed coal plants there have underperformed because of lower demand from consumers, making it more difficult for Pakistan to repay the debt. Under a debt-for-renewables swap, in theory, Pakistan and China would agree to refinance coal plants with lower interest and retire them earlier than planned with a promise by Pakistan to move toward a greater percentage of renewables to meet demand. That would reduce the risk of default for Chinese creditors, Nedopil Wang said, while accelerating Pakistan’s transition to renewable and cheaper sources of energy.

“You have loans at risk of non-performance, and a bank might want to get rid of them. Rather than having to write those loans down, a bank can get rid of them at 70 percent and thus actually make money,” Nedopil Wang said, noting that, in the case of a swap, the plants would still operate, but for a shorter period of time, providing revenue to pay back the new lower-priced debt.

An official at one of the country’s primary business lobbies recently urged the government to seek debt-for-nature swaps with China as the two countries discuss debt relief. And Aneel Salman, chair of economic security at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, noted that the country’s new sustainable financing framework explicitly says the government could consider the swaps as part of a blended finance deal. Pakistan’s finance minister has been actively talking about debt-for-nature swaps in public addresses, he added.

“We have shown our eagerness,” Salman said.

Ray also noted that a debt swap could be used to help the flood-prone country adapt to increasingly extreme weather.

A swap in Mongolia, meanwhile, would offer an unique opportunity for reforestation along the Chinese border to mitigate the sandstorms that blow into Beijing, Nedopil Wang said.

If China does pursue these swaps, it would join a growing trend. Countries have struck at least 10 debt-for-nature deals in recent years as climate change-induced extreme weather and the pandemic worsened the debt load in lower-income countries already struggling to pay back loans. In 2024, external debt in lower-income countries hit a record high of $8.9 trillion, while around 88 percent of the world’s most endangered ecosystems lie in debt-distressed nations.

Even the most ardent proponents of swaps don’t see them as a complete fix. They won’t close the world’s $700 billion annual financing shortfall for conserving biodiversity, nor the roughly $4 trillion gap for achieving the U.N.’s sustainable development goals, including greater access to clean energy and less poverty. But advocates argue they can meaningfully chip away at these problems by converting financial distress into public benefits.

The model could be particularly promising in parts of Africa, where Chinese companies have spent the past two decades mining the minerals that power the global renewable-energy transition, said Jean-Marc Malambwe Kilolo, an economist with the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa who has advised governments on debt-swap proposals.

Many African countries want to move beyond extraction and into higher-value refining and manufacturing for technologies like electric vehicles, he said. Well-designed debt-for-development swaps could support that shift while also benefiting local communities.

With roughly 43 percent of Africans lacking access to electricity, many households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking and heat. “People need to be incentivized not to cut trees—to preserve and conserve green spaces,” Malambwe Kilolo said. “If there is no economic benefit, then what’s the point of doing conservation?”

In Ecuador, the same needs—and incentives—could translate to conservation.

“Our Currency Is Our Biodiversity”

On a bright November afternoon, perched above the narrow streets of Cuenca, former Ecuadorian environment and foreign affairs minister Gustavo Manrique Miranda cradles a glass of red wine and lays out the philosophy that shaped his time in office.

“I really believe that we are as rich as any country in the world, but our currency is our biodiversity,” he said. “The challenge is how to create value from biodiversity while keeping it alive.”

For Manrique Miranda, debt-for-nature swaps became a way to do just that. During his tenure from 2021 to 2023 under President Guillermo Lasso, he helped engineer Ecuador’s first modern swap: reducing $1.63 billion in debt held by Credit Suisse (now UBS) to $656 million, while establishing a large marine reserve near the Galápagos Islands and a $323 million conservation fund to protect it. He then set in motion the discussions that would evolve into Ecuador’s ambitious Amazon debt swap, known as the Amazonian Biocorridor Fund.

As Manrique Miranda was negotiating those deals with bondholders, nonprofits and other Ecuadorian ministries, President Lasso was making his own appeal abroad—flying to Beijing to plead for relief from Chinese banks. Years of heavy borrowing under his predecessor, much of it backed by Ecuadorian oil, had left the country locked into continued extraction and owing more than $5 billion to China.

Lasso returned claiming a modest victory: China agreed to push back repayment deadlines and trim interest rates. Such incremental renegotiations have become a hallmark of how Beijing manages its sweeping amount of distressed debtors, reflecting the Communist Party’s generally inward-facing priorities and commercial-driven approach to lending.

Those working to bring China around to debt swaps say the appeal for creditors is twofold: They can move troubled debt off their balance sheets while securing some ready cash now. Institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. have played a pivotal role by providing political-risk insurance and other credit enhancements that de-risk the transactions—making the deals financially viable in the first place.

For nation-state creditors, the benefits extend beyond balance sheets. The swaps provide a reputational boost that can translate into political leverage down the road, all while broadcasting the creditor government’s environmental bona fides on the world stage.

Back in Cuenca, an Andean gateway to the Amazon, Manrique Miranda said that even if Beijing won’t step in as a creditor, he believes it could contribute in ways similar to the United States’ support for the Galápagos and Amazon Biocorridor deals—providing critically important political-risk insurance.

Manrique Miranda has ideas in mind, pointing to an unprotected marine zone north of the Galápagos, mangrove forests along the mainland coast and gold reserves that could remain unmined if a future deal made conservation the better option.

“China,” he said, “could be a player.”

Others who share Manrique Miranda’s cautious optimism see another factor at work: Chinese President Xi Jinping has spent recent years casting his country as a global champion of biodiversity and the architect of a new “ecological civilization.”

An Ecological Contradiction

At a global biodiversity summit hosted by China in 2021, Xi appeared on a massive video screen to unveil a bold new idea: a world where humans and nature coexist in harmony. He invoked images of panda sanctuaries and sprawling national parks where elephants and tigers roam, framing conservation as both noble and achievable.

That vision is not just rhetoric. Under Xi’s rule, the concept of an “ecological civilization” has been written into China’s constitution alongside provisions cementing his own indefinite rule. On the international stage, Xi presents himself as an environmental visionary, repeating one of his favorite slogans: “Green mountains are gold and silver mountains”—in other words, protecting nature pays.

For many outside China—especially in the United States, where conservative lawmakers invoke China as a foil to justify America’s own pollution-heavy industries—the country still conjures images of smog-choked skylines and blackened rivers. But that picture is increasingly outdated.

After decades of severe industrial pollution, Beijing has imposed some of the world’s strictest environmental regulations. It has outspent every other nation on renewable energy, built a vast corpus of environmental scientists and created national parks and protected areas on a scale larger than Yosemite and Yellowstone combined.

Over the past 40 years, China has become one of the most re-forested parts of Earth after Chinese officials ordered the planting of millions of trees to combat flooding, deforestation and the encroachment of the Gobi Desert in the northern part of the country. This effort, known as the “Great Green Wall,” has made China one of the world’s leading technical experts in “greening” land that’s been degraded or overused.

But China’s environmental turnaround within its borders has led to a growing ecological footprint abroad as the country shifts its extraction to forests, mountains and seascapes in Belt and Road Initiative partner countries.

To longtime China scholar, Judith Shapiro, this transformation is both impressive and troubling.

“There’s been real progress—air quality has improved, pollution enforcement is far stronger, and ecological restoration is happening at a scale few other countries could pull off,” she said.

“But the approach is extremely technocratic and top-down. It doesn’t involve public participation, community oversight or grassroots decision-making,” she added.

That’s a consequence, Shapiro said, of the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian governance and control over its citizens, which has only intensified under Xi.

The human cost has been stark. One of the clearest examples is China’s “Ecological Conservation Redlines,” a sweeping system that designates large swaths of land for protection and restricts industrial and residential use. While the policy has helped revive degraded ecosystems, it has also displaced millions from rural areas into cities, creating a new class of urban poor.

“It’s a form of quiet dispossession,” said Jesse Rodenbiker, who has conducted extensive field research in rural China. “People wake up one day and find they can no longer farm the land they’ve lived on for generations.”

Despite the social costs, the Communist Party hails ecological redlining as a triumph, an efficient way to conserve land by urbanizing rural populations and giving some people residency status. The model echoes the United States’ early conservation history, when Native Americans were forcibly removed to create national parks such as Yosemite. That “fortress conservation” philosophy was later exported overseas with more devastating human-rights consequences.

As the global conservation community increasingly reckons with these legacies, Beijing is positioning elements of its model as an export. Through the Kunming Biodiversity Fund announced at the 2021 summit, China has pledged more than $230 million to help developing countries meet their biodiversity goals. Coupled with a rapidly expanding web of technical exchanges, training programs and environmental assistance, China has cultivated what scholars describe as “green soft power”—a strategy that bolsters its influence in the Global South.

“China,” Rodenbiker said, “is offering resources others aren’t.”

A Black Box

On a sun-streaked cafe patio in Quito, Prieto leaned forward in a plastic chair, the environmental lawyer’s energy unflagging after a long day of meetings. Nearby, the capital’s late-afternoon traffic snaked around colonial edifices and plazas, fusing the tang of exhaust fumes with roasting coffee beans in the high Andean air.

Prieto was eager to talk. He has spent years grappling with the consequences of extractive foreign investment in Ecuador, projects promising beneficial development but leaving rivers slick with oil, forests razed and Indigenous communities displaced. His work has included a landmark case against Chevron, whose predecessor Texaco dumped millions of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon.

“I understand well how Western companies operate,” Prieto said, referring to the mechanisms he’s used to try to hold those firms accountable. “China, though, is a black box for us.”

Today, Prieto is president of the Quito-based Center for Economic and Social Rights (CDES), a nonprofit critical of Ecuador’s debt swaps, alleging they lacked transparency and public participation. In 2024, Prieto and CDES won concessions from the Inter-American Development Bank, a guarantor of the Galápagos transaction, to improve public access to information about the deal’s conservation fund.

Prieto has broader concerns about the deals: “They don’t help sustainability or protect nature effectively,” he said, noting that their complexity and drawn-out structure tend to generate substantial income to lawyers and administrators. He also takes issue with how communities are treated.

“In the Galápagos and now in the Amazon, Indigenous communities are often sidelined,” he added. “Only a small, select group is consulted.”

More than a million Indigenous people call Ecuador home. Many live in the Amazon and do not identify with the umbrella organizations typically brought to the negotiating table. That mismatch has long dogged both extractive and conservation efforts in Ecuador, resulting in processes that often overlook the diverse realities and consent of the communities involved.

Prieto said the lack of transparency surrounding environmental decisions in Ecuador is troubling, noting that the state-owned Chinese mining company he is currently suing has refused to release its waste pit construction plans. It cited a confidentiality clause it negotiated with the Ecuadorian government. Earlier this year another Chinese mining firm’s waste pit collapsed in Zambia, causing catastrophic destruction. Advocates there have also struggled to obtain that company’s planning documents.

Prieto worries that the details of any potential debt-for-nature deal could be similarly obscured.

According to Prieto and news reports, communities near the Amazonian mine have faced displacement, environmental contamination and other abuses, including violence against Indigenous women. “Communities feel they have no recourse,” Prieto said.

Many of those communities, academics and advocates also have ethical objections to debt-for-nature deals, which they argue has led to the “financialization of conservation”—treating nature as an asset to be priced rather than as a living system with inherent value. (Ecuador’s constitution is the only one in the world to recognize that nature, like humans, has rights to exist).

Even as China considers debt swaps for renewables or development—investments that can offer Beijing a clear financial return—tying debt relief to conservation could be a nonstarter, said Junjie Zhang, an environmental economist with Duke Kunshan University. China’s priority, he said, has always been development, not aid.

Most Chinese officials, he added, believe struggling countries must first “make a living” before tackling anything else. Debt swaps for conservation strike them as risky, even counterproductive.

“If you swap debt for nature, what about in the future? Can the country generate enough revenue? Then you again ask for money,” Zhang said.

And China, with its fiercely competitive economic culture and domestic sensitivity to giving money away, is wary of assuming the role of global green financier.

“China doesn’t want to be a leader,” he said. “A leader needs to pay.”

Yunnan Chen, a research fellow with the London-based overseas development think tank ODI Global (formerly Overseas Development Institute), pointed out that China went into debt when it pursued its own industrialization.

“It doesn’t necessarily see debt as inherently a bad thing. It sees it as a necessary phase that developing countries have to go through to make the right kinds of productive investments in order to then generate growth. And that is also why I think it’s resistant to giving that kind of concession or debt relief.”

When China extends debt relief—zero-interest loans or loan write-offs—it’s subsidized by the country’s foreign aid budget. “It’s a tiny, tiny proportion of the portfolio and it’s usually only the ones that are at the end of their maturity,” Chen said. “And it’s kind of a tick-the-box exercise for the news headline.”

Kevin Koenig, who has tracked China’s footprint in Ecuador for more than a decade, is blunt about the prospect of Beijing stepping into the conservation arena.

“I don’t want to call it greenwashing,” he said. “But if there were a real interest in biodiversity protection or debt cancellation, you’d do that differently, not: ‘We’re going to continue extraction, and on the side we’ll do a debt-for-nature deal’ very far away from the places their investment projects are destroying.”

Koenig sees the same contradictory elements in Ecuador’s existing debt-for-nature deals. They may channel money into protected areas, he said, but they don’t touch the forces driving deforestation and emissions in the first place. Even as the government celebrates the Amazonian Biocorridor debt-swap, it has continued to expand mining and approve new oil production blocks across the Amazon.

“These swaps won’t solve the fossil fuel or climate problem,” Koenig said. “They might save certain areas on paper, but they’re full of contradictions—countries promising a transition while doubling down on extraction.”

An Open Door

Since Ecuador pioneered one of the earliest debt-for-nature swaps in the late 1980s, the model for the deals has changed dramatically. After a period in which wealthy countries forgave portions of developing nations’ debt, the swaps have shifted into far more intricate, privately financed transactions. Today’s versions are vastly larger, often restructuring hundreds of millions or even more than a billion dollars in sovereign debt, and requiring layers of legal, financial and political coordination.

Ecuador’s Amazon swap, backed by The Nature Conservancy and public financial institutions, cut Ecuador’s debt obligation to some private bondholders from $1.53 billion to $730 million, while directing part of each payment into a conservation fund expected to raise $460 million over 17 years. The proceeds will go to Indigenous communities and conservation projects.

Speaking from a glassy high-rise in downtown Quito, Galo Medina, The Nature Conservancy’s Ecuador director, recalled just how arduous it was to pull off the deal. Initiated in 2022, the transaction outlasted two presidents and five environment ministers. Beyond the financial restructuring, the government codified new conservation commitments into law and, with The Nature Conservancy and other partners, established an independent trust fund to manage the money.

Medina insisted the trust fund is legally bound to fulfill conservation requirements set by the Ecuadorian government—not creditors who participated in the transaction or any other party. The fund also has to comply with Ecuadorian law, including the requirement that local communities are consulted about activities that could impact them.

The trust fund, he explained, is overseen by an independent board, including a representative from an Amazonian Indigenous organization. Once the fund is fully operational, he expects it to distribute roughly $17 million annually for conservation. The first call for proposals is expected toward the end of January.

“The main aspect that we’re looking for is the involvement and direct participation of local and Indigenous communities in the Amazon,” Medina said.

But he also acknowledged the tension at the heart of the effort—that the region the fund aims to protect is also where the government is expanding oil production and mining. His colleague, financial specialist Mónica Chávez, underscored the broader context: Developing countries would like to invest more heavily in conservation and climate commitments even as they face severe fiscal constraints.

“Then comes something like this, a debt-for-nature swap, and offers the chance for our country to send money for conservation that would be impossible in other circumstances,” she said. “This is an opportunity for Ecuador.”

As for whether Ecuador might one day participate in a swap with China, Chávez chose her words carefully.

“If it was an open door,” she said, “maybe we’d explore that.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2241478719-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 05:58:00.222164

Those are the individuals that you know should never have been pushed out of their out of their homes, some of these terrible stories that we would hear because they couldn't afford the taxes because they went up too high,"" Pol said.

Pol also speaking on the impact of the loss of funding for public safety, such as police officers and firefighters, with Michigan City saying it will not negotiate with the departments until the impact of the bill is known.

""The idea that we put our communities in such a strain that they, you know, they are looking at their budgets going we can't meet the needs of these, these agencies. It's, it's exactly what we want. And you know, the last thing we want to see is either a cut of services or that our firefighters or police officers and EMTs aren't being paid, but they should be,"" Pol said.

Outside of Senate Enrolled Act One, the impact of data centers in the state was a major topic of discussion, with the community feeling like they have a lack of answers.

""They're going to be their permanent neighbors, and they don't know what the effects of those are. They don't know how much their utility bills are going to go up. They don't, you know, some people have environmental concerns, health concerns, things that probably the data centers could do a very, a lot better of a job explaining,"" Pol said.",https://wsbt.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/1320/center/90/434998db-bfe7-407b-9e15-a9d21bb79392-MichiganCitySE1townhallAB.0019_frame_0.jpeg,N,,2025-12-21 03:57:44.982349

Is Plug Power a buy?

Plug Power is taking steps through Project Quantum Leap to enhance its business efficiency and improve its bottom line. The company aims to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce costs this year. Management is hopeful of ending the year with a breakeven gross margin and expects to achieve positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) by the second half of next year.

Management says the quality of project engagements is much higher than previously seen and that projects have a much higher probability of reaching a final investment decision compared to a few years ago, when fewer project opportunities advanced.

That said, Plug Power has its work cut out for it. Through the third quarter, the company still has a net loss of $789 million on $485 million in revenue. Investors should monitor Plug's initiatives going forward to see whether cost-cutting and a narrower focus on growth improve profitability. Until then, I believe investors are best advised to avoid the stock.

The progress was welcomed because far too often and for far too long Illinois state and city leaders have abused businesses to bail themselves out of fiscal mismanagement and spending increases. We’ll take the wins, but let’s keep going in the New Year.

The health of business is key to Illinois’ economic well-being, and our key sector also is our most vulnerable to politicians: small businesses. Nearly 99% of net new jobs created in Illinois since the pandemic came from businesses with fewer than 20 employees, amounting to about 172,000 jobs since 2020.

These businesses also are delivering faster wage growth. Since 2020, wages at businesses with fewer than 50 employees grew more than 30%, outpacing both mid-sized firms and large corporations.

For policymakers the lesson is clear: When businesses succeed, Illinois’ economy succeeds. The continued vitality of these employers means more jobs, better wages and abundant opportunity across the state — particularly in Cook County, where small firms have been the only net job creators since the pandemic.

Here’s what Illinois got right regarding business in 2025.

Rejecting tax hikes

One of the most immediate wins came from Chicago and other cities missing the Oct. 1 deadline to reinstate a local grocery tax. As a result, Chicagoans will avoid paying the tax through at least the first half of 2026, saving families an estimated $40 million over six months. Other large cities also will let grocery taxes end Dec. 31, including Springfield.

Illinoisans, as well as grocery stores, neighborhood markets and restaurants, have been struggling with inflation and rising food costs. Removing this tax alleviates some of the burden on residents and the local businesses that depend on steady foot traffic to operate.

Next, leaders rejected a first-in-the-world tax on unrealized capital gains and a statewide delivery tax that would’ve charged a flat fee on every purchase to fill a Chicago-area public transportation deficit. These would have been disastrous for Illinois residents and businesses.

Unfortunately, lawmakers did pass an increase to the Cook County and collar counties’ sales taxes. They decided most of the Regional Transportation Authority budget gap will be filled by shifting already-collected revenue from the transportation fund rather than from additional, new tax hikes.

Last, most Chicago aldermen have adopted a more business-friendly mindset during Chicago’s budget battle, with a large contingency rejecting Mayor Brandon Johnson’s plan to reinstate a “head tax” on employers. These aldermen cited the tax’s anti-growth, anti-business effects as reasons to find alternative plans that don’t punish the city's largest job suppliers.

Easing government regulations

Illinois progressed when state lawmakers ended a 40-year ban on building large-scale nuclear energy facilities. Lifting the nuclear moratorium should strengthen Illinois’ energy reliability, lower long-term costs and position the state to compete for advanced manufacturing, data centers and artificial intelligence investments. The moratorium reversal sent the message that Illinois is open to innovation, private capital and long-term economic growth.

Tech companies already have signaled strong interest in Illinois’ nuclear capacity, with firms such as Meta, Google and Microsoft pursuing long-term nuclear energy contracts. Meta’s deal supporting the Clinton Clean Energy Center preserved more than 1,100 high-paying jobs while replacing taxpayer subsidies with private investment — a model that benefits workers, businesses and taxpayers alike.

Chicago city leaders also embraced modern attitudes toward work by eliminating college degree requirements for most city jobs. By shifting toward skills-based hiring, the city opened the door to a broader workforce, which should reduce hiring bottlenecks and create new pathways to stable employment.

Illinois still faces serious fiscal challenges, but this year proved progress is possible when lawmakers work to eliminate barriers for businesses that will strengthen the economy.

The path forward is clear: continue prioritizing economic competitiveness and policies that let businesses grow. When Illinois chooses reforms that respect job creators and taxpayers, everyone benefits — and these bright spots show better choices are within reach.

Rowan County is one of 60 counties DEQ is adding to the program on Dec. 15, for a total of 98 counties. The final two counties will be added in January.

“The cost of living is too high across the board, so it’s particularly exciting to see Energy Saver NC’s initiative expand statewide,” said Governor Josh Stein in a press release. “This program will help more North Carolina families make ends meet and keep their energy costs affordable. I am pleased that Energy Saver NC is making homes healthier and more efficient and supporting local jobs across North Carolina.”

DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson added, “Energy Saver NC will help Rowan Co. families who need it most save money on utility bills, make their homes healthier and more comfortable, reduce pollution emissions, and improve our air quality. This vital program will improve North Carolinians’ lives on a daily basis, from efficient new electric appliances to installation of new heating and cooling systems.”

The program was launched in January 2025 with $208 million from the U.S. Department of Energy.

How it works

Energy Saver NC includes two pathways designed to help families make their homes more energy-efficient and drive down their utility bills:

Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings (HOMES) — Offers eligible households up to $16,000 for home efficiency upgrades, such as air sealing or energy-efficient HVAC units.

Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) — Provides up to $14,000 for high-efficiency electrical appliances such as heat pump water heaters and electric stoves.

Why it matters

By helping eligible families improve their homes with energy-efficient upgrades, the program:

Reduces monthly power bills.

Makes homes resilient and improves home comfort and safety, especially during extreme weather.

Strengthens the reliability of NC’s power grid by reducing energy demand and strain on the grid.

Supports local jobs that keep investing in the community.

Launched to meet growing energy demands and rising costs, Energy Saver NC directly supports North Carolina’s focus on ensuring that energy supplies are affordable, reliable and clean.

Who is eligible?

Rebates are based on household income and projected energy savings. Rebates include:

Full rebates — Up to 100 percent of project costs covered by the rebate up to a certain amount. Available for single-family homeowners earning less than 80 percent of their Area Median Income (AMI) as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Partial rebates — Up to 50 percent of project costs covered by the rebate up to a certain amount. Available for moderate-income homeowners earning between 80 percent and 150 percent of the AMI.

The rebate amount is paid to the contractor after the project is complete. Residents are only responsible for any remaining costs after rebate amounts are applied.

For example, a four-person household in Rowan County earning up to $70,150 may qualify for a full rebate. Both single-family homeowners and renters, with landlord approval, are eligible to apply.

Once income eligibility is confirmed, households applying for the HOMES program will receive a free home energy assessment. During the visit, a certified assessor will evaluate a home’s energy use and recommends improvements that will save families the most money.

All upgrades must be completed by an Energy Saver NC-approved contractor. Contractors are registered, licensed professionals specially trained in energy-efficiency installations. These partnerships not only ensure quality work but also create new business opportunities, local jobs, and economic growth within Rowan County.

After reviewing contractor quotes, households approve the projects and pricing with the rebate applied. Once the Energy Saver NC program team gives final approval, contractors complete the work, helping families start saving on their energy bills right away.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Salisbury-Post.png,N,,2025-12-21 07:58:42.559453

By Eric Starkman

My cousin Rob makes for a compelling case study as to why China has eaten Detroit’s lunch on electric vehicles — and who is ultimately responsible for the decline of America’s once globally respected automotive industry.

At the urging of a friend, Cousin Rob test-drove a Tesla Model Y in 2020 and bought one on the spot. Cousin Rob loves technology. He’s an early adopter who gravitates toward products he considers genuinely cutting edge. He put the Model Y squarely in that category.

A few years later, Rob upgraded to a Model S, and he couldn’t be happier. He regularly raves about Tesla’s software updates, incremental improvements, and services that legacy automakers still don’t seem to grasp, much less deliver. These are features the auto media either underplays, ignores, or, more alarmingly, seems not to understand at all.

What’s notable is that Cousin Rob didn’t suddenly declare himself an environmentalist or buy a Tesla to save the planet. He bought it because he viewed the car as technologically superior to internal combustion vehicles and among the safest on the road. His decision was based on technology, not politics.

That distinction matters.

Cardinal Rule

GM and Ford violated a cardinal rule that major U.S. corporations long understood: never get in bed with politicians or allow your products to become political statements. Joe Biden chose to make electric vehicles a political issue, repeatedly warning that climate change had reached “code red” and that the nation and the world were in peril. His administration never treated EVs as a consumer option, but as a mandate Americans were expected to accept without question.

GM’s Mary Barra and Ford’s Jim Farley eagerly climbed aboard that train. Both CEOs positioned themselves as leaders of environmentally virtuous companies, even as GM and Ford continued generating nearly all their profits from gas-powered trucks and SUVs. Barra went so far as to proclaim that GM would be selling more EVs than Tesla by 2025 and that by 2035 the company would manufacture only electric vehicles. There was no visible market research to justify such declarations.

What followed was a familiar pattern. GM and Ford expected U.S. taxpayers to subsidize their transitions while increasingly moving engineering and manufacturing operations offshore. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act showered EVs with incentives, many of which applied to vehicles most Americans could not afford, including models assembled in Mexico.

The federal and state governments also subsidized the construction and retooling of EV plants, while GM and Ford also counted on Washington to build a national charging infrastructure to support their products. When that failed to materialize, GM and Ford piggybacked on Tesla’s proprietary charging network, seemingly untroubled that their customers were now relying on a competitor to support their EVs.

Massive Marketing Budget Cut

Normally, when companies introduce genuinely new technologies, they increase marketing spending to explain and promote them. Yet in 2022, despite committing GM to a radical break from a century of internal combustion engineering, Barra cut the company’s marketing budget by $1 billion.

Norm de Greve, whom Barra recruited from CVS to serve as GM’s chief marketing officer, later told The Drum that he learned about the cut a week before joining the company while listening to an investor call. That suggests either that de Greve failed to confirm Barra’s commitment to marketing before accepting the job or that Barra pulled the rug out from under him after the fact.

Either way, de Greve’s October interview with The Drum is revealing. He speaks at length about GM rediscovering the “soul” of its brand and touts the company’s proprietary AI platform, Metropolis, which he credits with helping increase market share. Notably absent from the discussion is any meaningful reference to EV adoption, despite electric vehicles supposedly representing GM’s future.

For all of GM’s ballyhooed proprietary AI, it apparently lacked the intelligence to warn management that the company’s EV strategy was failing and headed for a $1.6 billion write-down — the same year Barra vowed she would be selling more Teslas than Elon Musk.

Musk’s Squandered Marketing Advantages

Musk, for his part, squandered advantages that could have buried GM and Ford and positioned their gas-engine fleets as the automotive equivalent of dial-up internet access. He is a brilliant technologist, but he does not value marketing and never properly branded Tesla as a cutting-edge Silicon Valley pioneer and distinguishing it from GM and Ford, whose profits are overwhelmingly driven by century old technology.

Steve Jobs understood the value of marketing. In 2009, when apps were still in their infancy and most Americans were unfamiliar with their capabilities, Apple ran compelling commercials explaining what apps did and how they could be downloaded to the iPhone, which had been introduced only two years earlier. Apps would have caught on eventually, but Apple’s 2008 App Store launch gave the company a decisive competitive edge.

Not only was Musk remiss in failing to brand Tesla as a pioneering technology company, he also tarnished the company’s brand by promoting his conservative politics and getting into bed with Donald Trump, alienating much of his core customer base.

Even today, Tesla does a poor job marketing its superior technological capabilities.

Thanksgiving Night Rescue

On Thanksgiving night, Cousin Rob was driving on a highway through the San Gabriel Valley, about 22 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, when he incurred a flat tire. Fortunately, just weeks earlier he had signed up for Tesla’s $25-per-month wheel and tire protection service, which covers tire replacement at no additional cost.

Despite it being a holiday weekend, Rob used his Tesla app to contact the company, and within 20 minutes a flatbed arrived to take him and his vehicle to the nearest Tesla service center. At approximately 9 a.m. the following morning, he received a notification that his tire had been replaced, and the car was ready for pickup.

In another example of Tesla’s more advanced technological capabilities, GM has confirmed plans to introduce iPhone digital key functionality using Apple Wallet, notably without offering a timeline. Cousin Rob has been using his iPhone as his Tesla key since he bought his first Tesla nearly six years ago. Tesla also mastered Apple watch connectivity months before GM, which stumbled on the integration.

That GM is now using Apple Wallet for key access is yet another example of how far one of America’s premier marketing companies has fallen. GM has made the unpopular decision to drop Apple CarPlay from its vehicles, yet it actively promotes Apple Wallet and has announced plans to add Apple Music to its in-car infotainment system. GM cannot seem to decide whether it wants its vehicles to support Apple products or not.

China’s EV Superiority

The contrast becomes even clearer when looking at China. What most Americans do not appreciate is why and how China achieved its EV superiority.

In the 1990s, China’s government concluded that it could never develop domestic brands capable of competing head-to-head with Volkswagen, BMW, or even General Motors, all of which had established strong market positions inside the country.

Beijing identified an opening where incumbents were vulnerable: electric vehicles. This strategy had little to do with climate change. China continues to expand coal-fired power generation to support its grid.

Instead, EVs were viewed as a way to leapfrog legacy automakers technologically and assert global industrial dominance. The government focused on execution, scale, and technical competence, drawing on experienced automotive leadership to drive its EV ambitions.

By contrast, decades later, after China had already established a commanding position in EVs, the U.S. approach framed electric vehicles primarily as a political and regulatory project rather than a consumer technology opportunity. The emphasis shifted toward symbolism and mandates, not product superiority or market appeal.

A Country of Cousin Robs

Chinese consumers are a massive collection of Cousin Robs and embraced EVs not because of climate messaging but because the vehicles were positioned as rolling technology platforms and tech-luxury lifestyle statements — aspirational, software-driven, and status-enhancing.

In China today, Tesla is no longer the uncontested leader in EV innovation. Domestic competitors have closed the gap and, in some cases, surpassed Tesla by treating electric vehicles as consumer technology products.

The U.S. media delights in pointing out that China currently has a glut of EVs, the result of its government spawning too many upstarts, which Barra herself says now number more than 100 competitors. That’s true. But China plays a long game, unlike Barra, who manages GM to meet the quarterly demands of Wall Street.

The undeniable truth is that the Biden administration chose to bet America’s EV future on GM and Ford, and Barra and Farley have unequivocally demonstrated they were not up to the challenge.

The Wisdom of Wall Street?

Still, both executives have their diehard defenders, particularly Barra, whose loyalists argue she is doing an outstanding job, pointing to GM’s fourth-quarter rally and a stock price trading near its 52-week high.

What those defenders rarely mention is what fueled that rally. Barra reassured Wall Street that GM was once again focused on selling high-margin gas-powered trucks and SUVs, while continuing to describe EVs as the company’s “North Star.”

“We believe Barra & Co. are prepared for all options on the table as it balances its ICE and EV strategies,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note.

This is the same Ives who more than four years ago declared that “the vertical integration capabilities of GM and conversion of its massive customer base to electric vehicles over the coming years represents a transformational opportunity” and issued a “buy” rating on GM’s stock that still trades below his projected target from four years ago.

For those who regard a company’s stock price as investor wisdom one can take to the bank, it is worth recalling that GM’s shares traded between roughly $30 and $40 in mid-2007, remained in the mid-20s through much of 2008, and a year later the company was bankrupt.

Investors did not anticipate that collapse until it was unavoidable, after GM had already depleted cash through buybacks and financial engineering — many of the same tools that have helped propel GM’s stock to its current level.",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_farley_and_barra_55685.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 23:58:24.697637

John Block and New Mexico GOP Chair Amy Barela—the landscape tells a different story from their rhetoric when it comes to renewable energy. Massive solar arrays like the 120 MW Buena Vista Energy Center and community projects like Pluma Solar Alamogordo and Carrizozo Solar stand as testaments to market-driven progress, generating hundreds of construction jobs, ongoing maintenance roles, and millions in local revenue for roads, schools, and services.

Tesla’s new Supercharger which just opened at Lowe’s Signature Market in Alamogordo further weaves EV infrastructure into the fabric, supporting skilled tech work for hardware, software upgrades, and upkeep—jobs that draw on high-demand skills in a county hungry for economic opportunities.

This quiet revolution unfolds amid political resistance: Otero County, with its vast sunny deserts and state trust lands, has become a hub for solar development despite its conservative leanings. Key projects include:

• Buena Vista Energy Center (also called Buena Vista Solar): The largest solar facility in New Mexico, located near Chaparral. Developed by NextEra Energy Resources and operational since 2023, it generates 120 MW of solar power plus 50 MW battery storage—enough to power ~60,000 homes. It spans ~2,700 acres, created ~150 construction jobs, and provides ~$12 million in tax revenue over 30 years for local roads, schools, and services. Operated under a long-term agreement with El Paso Electric, it doubles the utility’s solar capacity.

• Pluma Solar Alamogordo: A 5 MW community solar project on state lands, approved in 2025. It powers 1,250–1,500 homes and generates at least $2 million for Eastern New Mexico University. Located near Holloman Air Force Base, it exemplifies affordable clean energy access for locals unable to install rooftop solar.

• Carrizozo Solar Project: A 3 MW community-scale array owned by Otero County Electric Cooperative (OCEC). It delivers power at under 4.5 cents/kWh—one of the lowest U.S. rates for distributed solar—and saves members ~$250,000 annually in energy costs.

• Alamogordo Substation Solar Garden: A smaller 76 kW project by OCEC, operational since 2014, using micro-inverters for efficient renewable generation.

• Alamogordo Solar and Storage Project (125 MW solar + 50 MW storage): Acquired by Greenvolt Power in 2023 from Solariant Capital, expected to produce 300+ GWh annually and power ~20,000 homes.

These projects highlight Otero County’s role in New Mexico’s renewable boom, driven by state land auctions and private investment.

Tesla’s Role and the Alamogordo Supercharger

Tesla owns and operates its Supercharger network, including the Alamogordo station at Lowe’s Signature Market (675 E 10th St). Opened this week. This station features multiple stalls for fast charging—up to 250 kW—ideal for travelers along US-54/US-70 near White Sands National Park and Holloman AFB. Tesla partners with hosts like Lowe’s for site access, attracting EV drivers and boosting local foot traffic during the 30 minute charge to the Alamogordo MainStreet New York Avenue District and to downtown businesses.

Maintenance involves skilled Tesla technicians for hardware, software updates, and upgrades, creating jobs in Otero county with limited high-tech opportunities.

No other Tesla owned and managed Superchargers exist in Otero County; the network focuses on major routes, with nearby ones in Las Cruces and planned expansions like Roswell. Alamogordo led Roswell in this implementation.

Deeper Dive into Hypocrisy of Block and Barela

State Rep. John Block (R-District 51, Alamogordo) has called renewables “enviro-Marxist,” criticized the 2019 Energy Transition Act for harming fossil fuels, and introduced failed House Bill 45 in 2025 to impose a 3.75% excise tax on renewable production—potentially stifling growth. He advocates expanding oil, gas, and coal for jobs and revenue.

Amy Barela, Otero County Commissioner and NM GOP Chair (elected 2024), echoes this by prioritizing oil/gas to lower costs and strengthen the economy, opposing policies that shift from fossils.

Yet in their backyard, renewables flourish: Buena Vista alone created 150 construction jobs and millions in revenue, while community projects like Pluma and Carrizozo deliver affordable power and savings. The Tesla Supercharger enables EV adoption, aligning with clean energy trends. Critics call this hypocrisy—leaders decry renewables while local developments bring economic benefits, jobs, and infrastructure to a red county. Supporters argue it’s pragmatic: fossils remain key, but renewables add diversification without replacement.

Tying It All Together

In the heart of deep-red Otero County—home to Rep. John Block and GOP Chair Amy Barela—the landscape tells a different story from their rhetoric. Massive solar arrays like Buena Vista and community projects like Pluma and Carrizozo stand as testaments to market-driven progress, generating hundreds of construction jobs, ongoing maintenance roles, and millions in local revenue. Tesla’s Supercharger at Lowe’s further weaves EV infrastructure into the fabric, supporting skilled tech work and drawing travelers to Alamogordo.

This quiet revolution unfolds amid political resistance: Block’s failed tax proposals like most of his failures, and Barela’s fossil fuel focus contrast sharply with the tangible gains—higher wages from renewables, energy savings for residents, and economic boosts in a county that needs them.

What is revealed is a core irony: even in conservative strongholds with resistance by out of touch politicians like John Block, who has never worked a day in building a sustainable business model nor ever created a job, clean energy thrives! What business interests, in spite of out of touch politicians, is proving, is that renewable energy is not an ideological foe but a practical ally for jobs, resilience, and community strength.

As New Mexico pushes toward renewables, Otero County’s on-the-ground reality, driven by business interests versus political rhetoric—solar panels gleaming under the desert sun, EVs charging in parking lots near Alamogordo MainStreet —may ultimately bridge divides, showing that embracing solar and EV infrastructure strengthens communities for the long haul.

This legislative effort, supported by TIPRO, will streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969.

The following statement can be attributed to Ed Longanecker, President of TIPRO:

“On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers. For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges.

Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs. And communities waiting for the economic benefits of infrastructure development, including jobs, tax revenue, and improved local services, watch opportunity pass them by. In addition, the coming AI revolution, with the need to power massive data centers across the country, will drive further demand for American natural gas. When domestic production is throttled, imports from less regulated producers fill the gap, increasing global emissions and undermining U.S. environmental standards.

For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical. It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world. At a time when energy reliability and affordability are top concerns for working Americans, we strongly encourage expedited consideration in the U.S. Senate to help reshape the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure.”

The SPEED Act: Reforming Federal Permitting to Accelerate Economic Development

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R. 4776, represents a bipartisan legislative effort to streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Introduced on July 25, 2025, by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and cosponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), the bill aims to reduce bureaucratic delays that have long hindered infrastructure, energy, and economic projects across the United States. By addressing inefficiencies in environmental reviews, the SPEED Act seeks to foster economic growth, enhance energy security, and support critical developments such as transmission lines, data centers, and manufacturing operations, while maintaining core environmental safeguards.

Key Provisions of the SPEED Act

The SPEED Act modifies NEPA to expedite approvals without eliminating environmental oversight. Notable provisions include:

Standardizing Review Processes: The bill redefines “major federal actions” to exclude designations based solely on federal funding and exempts actions already reviewed under equivalent federal, state, or tribal environmental laws.

Setting Deadlines: It imposes strict timelines for environmental assessments and impact statements, typically limiting reviews to one to two years, to prevent indefinite delays.

Limiting Judicial Review: Lawsuits challenging NEPA compliance must be filed within 150 days of final agency action, and courts are directed to remand cases for correction rather than halting projects entirely. This provision also restricts standing to parties who submitted comments during the public review process, curbing frivolous or politically motivated litigation.

Enhancing Agency Coordination: The legislation requires better interagency collaboration and focuses reviews on “proximate” effects directly caused by the project, excluding speculative or unrelated impacts.

These reforms are designed to balance environmental protection with economic imperatives, particularly in sectors like mining, energy production, and AI infrastructure, where permitting delays have historically increased costs and deterred investment. Supporters argue that the bill will unlock domestic resources, reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, and create jobs.

The SPEED Act is particularly vital for the oil and natural gas industry, where protracted NEPA permitting processes have significantly impeded exploration, infrastructure development, and overall energy security. Over the past five decades, NEPA has evolved into a complex framework burdened by court rulings, executive directives, and agency interpretations, resulting in unpredictable delays that deter investment, stifle innovation, and increase project costs. For oil and gas exploration, these delays have stalled federal leasing and project approvals, limiting access to domestic resources and exacerbating reliance on foreign imports, which undermines national energy independence.

In terms of infrastructure, the bill addresses barriers to constructing essential facilities such as pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, and drilling operations. Permitting bottlenecks have historically prevented timely market access for crude oil and natural gas, leading to higher flaring rates and inefficient resource utilization. By imposing reasonable timelines, reducing frivolous litigation, and streamlining interagency reviews, the SPEED Act enables faster development of these projects, ensuring they are delivered on budget and supporting more efficient production methods. This is crucial for meeting growing domestic and global energy demands, particularly amid rising needs from sectors like artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

On energy security, the legislation promotes the expansion of reliable, affordable American energy supplies, generating jobs and tax revenues while potentially reducing global emissions by displacing higher-emission foreign alternatives. Overall, by cutting red tape while preserving environmental protections, the SPEED Act positions the oil and natural gas sector to contribute more effectively to national security, economic growth, and a stable energy grid.

Senate action in 2025 remains uncertain and unlikely, however reform could gain traction in 2026 as part of larger legislative packages, such as energy security or infrastructure bills, amid partisan debates on environmental policy. Advocates are pushing for Senate consideration, emphasizing the bill’s role in national security and economic competitiveness. If enacted, the SPEED Act could significantly reshape federal permitting, potentially accelerating projects critical to AI development and domestic manufacturing in the coming years.

There’s a word for this kind of reactionary response: greenlash, a social and political backlash against efforts to rein in emissions.

That opposition was mainly driven by specific economic burdens—Germany’s plan to switch to energy-efficient heat pumps caused an uproar as homeowners worried about the costs, for example.

A. Causes

A central impetus behind the recent EPA rollbacks was an administrative shift towards market-oriented regulations. In January 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” aiming to promote energy production, primarily fossil fuels. The administration particularly emphasized efforts to “reduce trillions in regulatory cost,” (EPA.gov 2025) portraying environmental regulations as hidden taxes on families and businesses.

Two months later, the EPA announced “plans to roll back 31 key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change,” including a reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Another specific focus was fuel economy standards. The Trump administration sought to revise the Obama-era regulations under the SAFE Vehicles Rule. Consistent with the rationale of the Executive Order, Trump contended that stricter fuel efficiency standards raised vehicle prices and limited consumer choice.

Industry stakeholders and federal oversight were two important factors in these decisions. Groups representing fossil fuel, automotive, and heavy industry sectors claimed that environmental regulations increased compliance costs and harmed their competitiveness. Furthermore, the administration diminished the EPA’s enforcement capabilities through budget cuts and staff reductions, reflecting a broader intention to reduce the agency’s role in industry oversight.

B. Current Stances

Public and political responses to these regulatory rollbacks are mixed. Opponents, notably public health groups and environmental organizations, assert that weakening environmental regulations could result in increased health risks and a dramatic increase in air quality, emissions, and pollution, which is especially critical to communities already facing climate-related challenges.

Supporters counter that these changes lessen unnecessary regulatory burdens, reduce energy and manufacturing costs, and enhance U.S. competitiveness. The rollback of certain monitoring requirements for oil and gas producers was presented as a means to lower costs for small operators, and the revision of power plant rules was characterized as a way to balance environmental protection with economic flexibility. Many also argue that deregulation can foster innovation by giving industries more freedom to explore new technologies without strict compliance constraints.

These contrasting perspectives reflect a broader divide in US environmental policy between prioritizing public health and industry demands.

C. Relevance

The consequences of weakening environmental regulations during the Trump administration are directly linked to real-world climate disasters, such as the Southern California wildfires in January 2025. Scientists contend that the hot, dry, and windy conditions that fueled those fires were made approximately 35% more likely due to human-induced climate change (Yale Climate Connections 2025). Policies that reduce emissions standards or resists greenhouse gas regulations could increase the frequency or severity of these devastating climate disasters.

At the international level, the stakes are even higher. At the recent COP 30 meeting hosted in November, governments engaged in important policy discussions on climate change agreements and limits on fossil fuel use. The Trump administration’s absence in this conference has been criticized as an undermining of U.S. leadership at a time when global cooperation is essential to transition away from fossil fuels.

II. Impact on Communities

A. Stakeholders

A wide range of stakeholders are involved in these EPA changes. The EPA itself is a stakeholder, with internal divisions arising regarding the direction of the agency. In July 2025, the EPA put 139 employees on leave for signing a “declaration of dissent” voicing concerns over changes in the EPA’s research and development priorities and the termination of environmental justice initiatives that benefitted vulnerable communities (Cunningham, 2025).

Oil and gas companies are another prominent stakeholder. In March 2025, EPA announced plans to reconsider wastewater regulations for oil and gas industries to “unleash American energy” (US EPA, 2025a). Supporters argue that these changes reduce regulatory burdens and stimulate industries, while critics contend they debilitate accountability for environmentally harmful practices.

Vulnerable communities will also experience significant negative impact from these policies. For instance, the EPA’s plans to “terminat[e] Biden’s Environmental Justice and DEI arms of the agency (EJ/DEI)” will harm communities already experiencing the effects of climate change and environmental issues disproportionately (US EPA, 2025a; US EPA, 2025b).

Environmental organizations such as the NRDC and Center for Biodiversity are also crucial stakeholders attempting to mitigate the environment impact of these changes. The 2009 Endangerment Finding, which revealed that climate change was a risk to human welfare and health, is set to be reconsidered by the EPA (US EPA, 2025a). This carries the risk of undoing environmental organizations’ attempts to alleviate the effects of climate change and educate the public on the issue.

Finally, the general public is critically affected by these decisions. The EPA currently maintains that “it will be more affordable [for Americans] to purchase a car, heat homes, and operate a business… to bring manufacturing into local communities while individuals widely benefit from the tangible economic impacts” (US EPA, 2025a). Whether these economic benefits will outweigh environmental and public health costs remains contested.

B. Youth Impact

Young people in the United States are particularly affected by these regulatory changes as they will see their long-term consequences of environmental change and pollution. In fact, a 2016 report by the Center for Effective Government found that “nearly one in 10 children in the country attends one of the 12,000 schools located within 1 mile of a chemical facility” (Jones, 2025). Furthermore, as children are particularly more vulnerable to pollutants, concerns for youth health are also prevalent (Jones, 2025). In responses to these risks, advocacy groups and policymakers may increasingly pursue regulatory policies and attempts to further research and public outreach about environmental pollution and climate change.

III. Policy Problem

Current efforts and policy changes under the Trump Administration include key environment targets such as clean energy, water protection, and clean air.

A. Clean Energy

In June 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule replacing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). Its main purpose was to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by establishing emission guidelines for individual states. Instead of encouraging a broader nationwide reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, the ACE focuses on emission reductions and efficiency improvements for individual power plants. Major regulations on reducing emissions are limited to reducing emissions from major power plants rather than encouraging an industry-wide transition to natural gas or renewable energy.

Therefore, although the Clean Energy Act reduces the emissions of major power plants, it is expected to increase the number of operating coal plants and amount of coal-fire electricity generation. It is estimated that by 2030, there will be an increase in the number of operating coal plants, with 28% of model plants showing higher CO2 emissions. In general, enforcements and regulations of the Clean Energy Act were less strict than the Clean Power Plan of the previous administration.

B. Water Protection

In 2020, the Trump administration rewrote the Water of the United States (WOTUS) to the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) under the Clean Water Act. This new regulation significantly narrowed the scope of water bodies protected by federal law. The final revised definition of the Water of the United States was published on January 2023 and took effect the following March. The new revised act continues the protection of major water bodies, such as oceans, navigable waters, lakes used in commerce and many upstream waters. However, it removes and limits protection for other smaller and more isolated water bodies, neglecting the protection of all water bodies. Examples of excluded water bodies include ephemeral streams from rainfall, ditches, lakes and ponds that did not drain into regulated waters, and wetlands that did not touch regulated waters. This massively reduces the overall scope of the Clean Water Act. There have also been failed attempts to weaken PM2.5 standards from 12 to 9 along with attempts to dismiss the Particulate Matter Review Panel, a group of scientists specializing in researching PM2.5 health effects.

C. Clean Air

In January 2025, California withdrew requests for Clean Air Act waivers from the EPA that were needed to support vehicle emissions regulations. In 2019, the Trump administration revoked California’s waiver for greenhouse gas emissions, acting as a hindrance to California’s goal to transition to zero-emission vehicles.

IV. Policy Options

A. Restore BIPOC Inclusion in Environmental Law and Decision-Making

During the Trump administration, the EPA significantly weakened its commitment to environmental justice, removing references to equity, reducing community consultation, and disbanding advisory bodies that included BIPOC voices. These actions left marginalized communities even more vulnerable to pollution and environmental harm.

To directly address this damage, Congress should pass legislation mandating that all EPA rulemakings undergo a Racial and Environmental Equity Impact Review, with measurable criteria for assessing disproportionate harm. The EPA must also re-establish and expand its National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), ensuring that it includes BIPOC legal and scientific professionals from frontline communities. In addition, a new Environmental Justice Civil Legal Fund should be created to ensure that communities of colour can access legal representation during disputes over permitting, contamination, or infrastructure siting. These measures will ensure that those most affected by pollution are not excluded from shaping the laws intended to protect them.

B. Rebuild Community Environmental Education and Organizing Capacity

Under the Trump administration, federal funding for environmental education, particularly in underserved communities, was sharply reduced, and support for science-based public engagement was deprioritized. This created a knowledge gap and limited the ability of affected residents to identify hazards or respond effectively.

To rebuild public capacity, the EPA should partner with the Department of Education to launch a Community Environmental Education Initiative, directing funds toward schools and nonprofits in areas previously underserved by federal support. These programs must include education on environmental health risks, regulatory rights, and organizing strategies. Furthermore, the federal government should incentivize public colleges to develop Environmental Justice Certificate Programs for local organizers and high school graduates from impacted areas. Investing in BIPOC-led educational programming, especially around pollution tracking, legal action, and data collection, will empower communities to hold agencies and polluters accountable when regulatory systems fail.

C. Reintroduce Federal Monitoring and Accountability Mechanisms

One of the most damaging changes under the Trump administration was the suppression of scientific data, the rollback of emissions standards, and the loosening of regulatory enforcement for polluting industries. The EPA weakened protections under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, removed climate change references from official documents, and allowed more discretion for state-level leniency, despite rising environmental health disparities.

To reverse these effects, the EPA must reinstate the Clean Power Plan (CPP) or introduce a stronger federal emissions framework that sets mandatory state-by-state targets, prioritizes renewables, and limits reliance on natural gas as a “bridge fuel.” In addition, Congress must require the EPA to publish annual equity audits, detailing how each regulation has impacted air, water, and public health in BIPOC communities. A centralized Public Environmental Risk Portal should also be developed, making real-time pollution data, enforcement actions, and permit approvals transparent and accessible to the public.

Crucially, new legislation must include anti-backsliding provisions, which prevent future administrations from rolling back protections without rigorous scientific review and Congressional oversight. Regulatory enforcement should be tied to federal funding eligibility; agencies and contractors that fail environmental justice compliance checks should be denied grants or licenses. These reforms will ensure that the EPA is not weaponized for political deregulation in future administrations.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6580bf6203485cf15c72a4f1/6946f6e01f06c883fc9a4a20_marcin-jozwiak-NdMcz5d74Ak-unsplash%20(1).jpg,N,,2025-12-21 01:57:27.480788

Here comes Santa Claus

Here comes Santa Claus

wearing his bulletproof vest.

He’s bringing lots of toys

and bags of fun,

but all they want

are more ammo and lots of guns.

Nine teens are shot

after the lighting of the annual Christmas tree.

As Governor Pritzker defiantly declares:

“We don’t need the National Guard here,”

violent criminals are getting away.

What a way to spend the holidays,

when bullets are flying your way.

So let’s hope here in Philly

we can show “The Brotherly Love” way,

to spend a safe and joyous Christmas Day.

Support Red Cross

When disaster strikes, it often happens in the middle of the night, catching families off guard and leaving them with nothing but uncertainty. In those moments, Red Cross volunteers – neighbors from our own community – are there to provide comfort, emergency lodging and recovery support. Thanks to donations of money and time, this kind of care happens every eight minutes across the U.S., most often after a home fire. And during the holidays, home fire responses spike nearly 20% nationwide due to seasonal risks. In Southeastern Pennsylvania alone, our volunteers have provided emergency assistance to more than 170 people after nearly 50 home fires – just since Thanksgiving. We’ll be there for them – because of our generous donors and volunteers who help in so many ways. But our mission goes beyond disaster relief; we help patients in need of lifesaving blood, teach critical skills like first aid and CPR and support veterans and military families navigating unique challenges. This holiday season, please consider donating at redcross.org. Your gift ensures that when the unexpected happens, families have the support and care they need – because no one should face a disaster alone.

Approve clean-energy projects

Pennsylvania families will see higher electricity bills this winter, with PECO customers facing a 6% increase. One major reason for these rising costs isn’t something most of us ever hear about: PJM, the group that runs our power grid. PJM is responsible for approving new energy projects across our region. Yet nearly all of the renewable projects proposed in recent years are stuck waiting in their “queue.” These renewable energy projects would supply enough electricity to power 60 million homes in the region. Instead of advancing these cost-saving solar, wind and storage projects, PJM has slowed approvals to a crawl, keeping us reliant on expensive, polluting fossil fuels. Pennsylvania is currently 49th in the nation when it comes to renewable energy growth. We need that to change. If PJM allowed the clean-energy projects already proposed to connect to the grid, we could lower utility bills, reduce harmful emissions and make Pennsylvania a leader in affordable, homegrown renewable power. PJM should clear its backlog and bring these overdue clean-energy projects online. Pennsylvania families deserve an energy system that keeps the lights on without polluting our air, driving up costs or locking us into outdated methods.

School district is the problem

The city has passed so many bills to help tenants and screw the landlords, I’m surprised there are any rentals on the market. It’s amazing how the powers-to-be deem this because the city has so many low-income residents. Maybe the city officials are looking at the situation a— backwards. They should start with the city’s beloved school system that is under-educating and producing low-income renters. This is the source of problem. When your education system has a graduation rate of about 68% and the present 4th-graders are way below the national averages in math and reading, of course you’re going to have low-income residents. The problem isn’t high rents and fees, it’s the city officials allowing the school district to graduate low-income residents. Solve the education problem and you will solve the low-income problem. Stop putting a Band-Aid on it.
