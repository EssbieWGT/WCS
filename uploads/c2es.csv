Dive Brief:

A federal judgeon Thursday granted a preliminary injunction blockingthe U.S. Department of Energyfrom instituting a 15% cap on reimbursement for colleges’ indirect research costs.

A group of universities and higher education associations sued the department in April, alleging it had overstepped its authority in implementing the policy and applying the change retroactively by terminating grants with reimbursement rates above the cap.

In her ruling last week, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with the plaintiffs' arguments and said they are likely to succeed in proving the Energy Department's funding cap is ""arbitrary and capricious” and violates federal law.

Dive Insight:

Burroughs had temporarily blocked the Energy Department's policy days after the plaintiffs filed suit. Thursday’s ruling extends that freeze, banning the agency from applying its rate cap policy to any colleges until she orders otherwise.

Despite the government's mounting legal losses, the Trump administration is not letting up on efforts to limit research-related funding to colleges.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced Wednesday it would enact its own 15% indirect research cap.The agency estimated that the change will reduce outgoing funding by $900 million annually.

""We will not stop at new grants,""U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in the memo. ""Meaningful savings can also be achieved by revisiting the terms of existing awards to institutions of higher education.""

Hegseth directed agency officials to terminate and reissue previously -awarded grants under the new terms if colleges do not agree to them.

COGR, an association for research universities and institutes and medical centers,criticized the Defense Department proposal as a cut to national security.

""Under the Trump Administration, DOD is the fourth federal agency to impose a 15% cap on research indirect cost reimbursement rates. The courts continue to halt implementation of these harmful policies,"" Matt Owens, president of COGR, said in a statement Friday. ""It’s time the Administration stop issuing misguided policies and start working in good faith with the academic research community.""

The Energy Department announced its ceiling on indirect research costs on April 11, following in the footsteps of the National Institutes of Health, which had announced a similar one in February. A federal judge in early April struck down the NIH cap.

In announcing the Energy Department's version, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the change would ensure federal funding efficiently supported research versus “administrative costs and facility upgrades.”

The department, which awards about $2.5 billion annually to over 300 colleges, estimated the cuts would halt $405 million in indirect cost funding annually.

The plaintiffs — including groups like the American Council on Education and the Association of American Universities and colleges like Princeton and Cornell universities — sued three days after the Energy Department's announcement.

In addition to alleging that the policy is unlawful, the lawsuit argues the funding change threatens the country's scientific and medical research advancement. Prior to the cap, many of the college plaintiffs had indirect research reimbursement caps north of 50%, according to court documents. Princeton, for example, negotiated an indirect cost rate of 62% for fiscal year 2024.

In her ruling, Burroughs said the agency needed to have a strong underlying rationale to change its negotiated rates with colleges.

But the department's 15% cap policy, ""even read generously, offers very little by way of explanation or justification for the decision to so suddenly and drastically limit reimbursement for indirect costs,"" she wrote.

The judge acknowledged that the Energy Department might have information that could support the new cap.

""If such data exists, however, it was not made public or otherwise articulated,"" she wrote.

The plaintiffs' lawsuit called the Energy Department's policy a ""virtual carbon copy” of the NIH's. In permanently blocking that cap, U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley ruled that NIH enacted it without following proper procedures and violated prohibitions against applying new policies retroactively.

“DOE’s action is unlawful for most of the same reasons and, indeed, it is especially egregious because DOE has not even attempted to address many of the flaws the district court found with NIH’s unlawful policy,” the plaintiffs in the Energy Department lawsuit said.

Burroughs last week agreed with Kelley's decision, calling it ""a well-reasoned opinion.""NIH has appealed that ruling.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/C68f5loqmG3G7M1emnw_xbOcZOAeo7EJQiheALGihyw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ET0VfZmFjYWRlXy1fV2FzaGluZ3Rvbl9EQy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:07.900680

This is after the industry has expressed trepidation over Trump energy and tariff policies that created uncertainty in the market by driving up costs, reducing domestic output and dissuading domestic producers from investing in exploration and expanded production, The Center Square reported.

While the Texas oil and natural gas industry reported job gains in January and February, it reported losses in March for the first time in months as rig counts dropped, The Center Square reported. The industry slightly rebounded in April, according to the latest employment data, The Center Square reported.

Uncertainty in the industry remains due to federal energy policies and “numerous economic and geopolitical factors” that continue to impact domestic production and related investment decisions, the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) said. This includes Trump administration tariffs on steel and aluminum and encouraging OPEC+ countries to increase production, driving down domestic production and profits, The Center Square reported.

However, a positive development is a commitment to reversing Biden administration-era policies, TIPRO notes. This includes Congress prioritizing pro-energy policies in its budget reconciliation bill, referred to by President Donald Trump as one “big, beautiful bill.” The policies include expanding federal fossil fuel leasing, reducing royalty rates, streamlining the permitting process, repealing so-called clean energy incentives, refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP).

The proposals were included in the energy sections of the House Ways and Means Committee and House Natural Resources Committee packages, including prioritizing expanding fossil fuel production, TIPRO notes. The sections were included in the package before the House Budget Committee, which failed to advance it on Friday.

TIPRO and others have called for prioritizing domestic energy production, expanding critical infrastructure, including LNG ports and pipelines, protecting key tax provisions essential to the industry, among other priorities.

Included in the House package is a requirement for at least 30 oil and natural gas lease sales to be made on federal land and in the Gulf of America over the next 15 years. In Alaska, it requires six lease sales for Cook Inlet and authorizes leasing to begin in the National Petroleum Reserve and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also reinstates quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales, generating an estimated $12 billion in revenue, TIPRO notes.

House energy proposals also reduce royalty rates to 12.5% for onshore and offshore drilling, down from 16.67% and 18.75%, respectively, and put processes in place to increase permitting approvals for energy projects.

House Republicans also repealed provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including clean energy incentives that provided tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy projects. They also curtailed the hydrogen production credit and expired “technology neutral” clean energy credits by 2031, TIPRO notes.

The House proposal also allocated $1.5 billion to replenish the SPR and delayed MERP by 10 years.

“With the exponential growth in energy demand forecasted in the coming years, oil and natural gas will continue to play a dominant role, but we must have the right strategy in place to provide regulatory and economic certainty to our members for the benefit of our country and allies,” TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said.

With Texas continuing to lead the U.S. in oil and natural gas production, emissions reductions and job growth, “sound policies that support fair business practices and laws that keep our state competitive are necessary if Texas is going to continue to benefit from oil and natural gas activity,” Texas Oil & Gas Association President Todd Staples said.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/05/19021720/AP25062706781334-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:11.717015

A phased reduction of tax incentives for renewable projects, the termination of both the electric vehicle tax credits and clean hydrogen production credits are possible.
Sylvia Leyva Martinez, Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analyst for utility-scale solar, says the US solar manufacturing sector could be negatively affected.

Emerging technologies: hydrogen hit hard, CCUS unscathed The Ways and Means Committee proposes to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit.","“When it rains, it pours” is a popular expression around the world. It reflects a series of events that cascade in quick succession and can have big implications. And it defined US energy and economic policy last week.

Detailed answers have emerged to an important question facing the US energy sector: how will the Republican party change Biden-era policies?

There is a clear agenda from the Republican-led Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees: bolstering traditional energy sectors and reducing low-carbon energy incentives. Leasing activity for the Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico) and geothermal acreage are set for a major expansion under proposed legislation. While nuclear power investment incentives have a faster sunset, other federal policies provide momentum for the sector. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) was a surprise winner, with incentives largely unchanged.

Zero-carbon energy policy could change radically, should House Republicans have their way. A phased reduction of tax incentives for renewable projects, the termination of both the electric vehicle tax credits and clean hydrogen production credits are possible. These modifications could dramatically delay the transition to low-carbon technologies in the United States.

It is important to note that Congress is still debating the future of US energy policy. As the budget reconciliation process progresses, further legislative changes are highly likely. Senate Republicans are advocating for more moderate changes to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 to ensure reliable power supply, maintain foreign investment in US energy and preserve economic growth.

Zero-carbon power: investment incentives are shorter and harder to claim

Beyond the phase-out of production tax credits (PTC) and investment tax credits (ITC) for wind, solar storage, and nuclear, other provisions in the proposed legislation could slow down investment. In the proposed bill, projects are eligible for tax credits once they are placed in service, rather than from the start of construction. Transferability of credits would also end, eliminating a key option for financing projects. Stringent new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions for some of the tax credits would further restrict investment.

Companies using components with material assistance or licensing agreements from prohibited foreign entities, known as FEOC would be disqualified from receiving the credits.

For wind, the most significant aspect of the proposals may be section 112014, which outlines a halt on the advanced manufacturing tax credits for all wind locally produced components starting from 2027. Significant investments have been made in recent years to strengthen the US wind supply chain, particularly in nacelle assembly and tower manufacturing.

Sylvia Leyva Martinez, Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analyst for utility-scale solar, says the US solar manufacturing sector could be negatively affected. The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit would remain at full value starting in 2029, then decrease to 75% in 2030, 50% in 2031 and 0% in 2032. But although the slower phase-out is positive for manufacturers, US companies licensing Chinese technology or engaging in joint ventures with Chinese entities would lose access to the 45X credits under the FEOC exclusions. This could disrupt solar component supply for US solar manufacturing.

For storage, the impact would be exacerbated by increased tariffs because of the US market’s reliance on batteries from China, says Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s Global Head of Energy Storage.

Even with proposals from House Republicans, there is still momentum for new nuclear power. According to Gerardo Bocard of Wood Mackenzie’s Scenarios and Emerging Technologies team, there are three areas to watch. The US Department of Energy recently reissued a US$900 million SMR funding program. Licensing improvements are taking place following the ADVANCED Act, which should lower project development costs. New project learning rates from Canada's nuclear investment program can be applied to new nuclear projects in the US.

For geothermal, the Ways and Means bill accelerates the phase-out of the ITC. While this is a challenge, the Energy and Commerce Committee is proposing to increase geothermal lease sales on federal lands. Richard Hood of Wood Mackenzie’s Geothermal team, notes that several states including New Mexico, North Dakota, and Colorado are enacting legislation to expand geothermal investment. In addition, lease sales were announced in Alaska and Utah.

Despite conflicting signals, the investment tailwind for geothermal remains: the DoE announced over a billion dollars’ worth of funding for geothermal related projects, the House of Representatives passed significant bills supporting the exploration and development of resources and, tech giant Apple expanded its data center capacity and increased support for US manufacturing.

Transport: electric vehicle incentives are phased out; support for biofuels expands

For electric vehicles, the House Ways and Means proposal eliminates the new clean vehicle credit for any vehicle placed in service after 31 December 2026, effectively phasing out the tax credit. For electric vehicles, the House Ways and Means proposal restricts the clean vehicle credit (CVC) to 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer in 2026, eliminates the CVC from 2027 and the commercial clean vehicle credit, including leasing, from 2026.

Prateek Biswas and Andrew Brown, Wood Mackenzie’s lead analysts covering the transport sector, expected these changes. The proposals are consistent with our worst-case scenario forecast, which projected EV penetration in 2030 to drop to 23% from around 32% in Wood Mackenzie’s base case. More steps to change EV incentives are likely, according to Biswas and Brown.

Key developments to watch: Lee Zeldin’s Environmental Protection Agency is likely to lower federal greenhouse gas emission standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe. Sean Duffy’s Transportation Department will revise Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ) standards. The Trump administration is also likely to challenge California’s zero emission vehicle wavier.

Policy support for biofuels expands with amendments to the Clean Fuel Production Credit under 45Z. The credit would be extended to 2031, increasing investor certainty. The proposed legislation excludes emissions from indirect land use change in carbon intensity calculations, increasing credit values for domestic food-crop based biofuels. While the legislation also limits credit eligibility to feedstocks sourced outside of North America and could reduce the US market’s appeal, imports are still likely due to state level clean fuel credits from the low carbon fuel standards and the federal renewable fuel standard.

Emerging technologies: hydrogen hit hard, CCUS unscathed

The Ways and Means Committee proposes to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit. This would apply to facilities beginning construction after 31 December 2025. This change exacerbates market uncertainty since the credit was introduced in 2022 as part of the IRA.

Wood Mackenzie's analysis shows that 95% of the 3.4 million tonnes per annum of announced green hydrogen capacity is at risk. According to Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analysts for low-carbon hydrogen Hector Arreola and Bridget van Dorsten, this policy change could significantly impact the US clean hydrogen industry's growth and competitiveness in the global clean energy market.

CCUS incentives emerge largely unharmed from the Ways and Means Committee. The 45Q tax credit remains unchanged in quantity and duration, but the Committee's proposal includes two modifications: a restriction barring entities from ""covered nations"" (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) from claiming 45Q credits and an elimination of the transferability of the 45Q credit.

Even with these minor modifications, Rohan Dighe, US CCUS lead for Wood Mackenzie, notes that CCUS projects currently in development in the US should not see major impacts if this proposal is enacted.

Upstream: lease sales will jumpstart Gulf of America (GoA) exploration

The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to expand offshore oil and gas leasing. Draft legislation requires 30 total lease sales between 2025 and 2040, beginning in August 2025. This would replace the Biden administration’s leasing goals, which led to only three lease sales in the GoA since 2021, well below the historical average.

More frequent leases will unlock more GoA production through exploration, according to Miles Sasser Senior Analyst of Wood Mackenzie’s L48 upstream team. Right now, the GoA is around 20% of global deepwater production. But with its current project profile, the GoA peaks by 2027. With exploration, we think it is possible to maintain about 2 million boe/d of GoA production beyond 2030. Key companies to watch include Chevron, Shell and BP, all of which have the technological capabilities to open up new GoA resources.

Minerals: more domestic supply won’t offset China’s dominance

The House Energy and Commerce Committee also aims to expand production for copper, nickel and lithium. Each are key minerals for zero-carbon energy technologies. According to the committee, more US mineral production could come from renewing mineral leases, expanding mineral exploration and improving project permitting.

But expanding US mineral supply does not address the core issue facing the US minerals sector. Any expansion to US mineral production will be dependent on China’s supply chains for battery components, cells and recycling, according to Wood Mackenzie’s Adrian Gardner, Principal Analyst. Trade tariffs could be a catalyst for investments in copper smelters in the US, although investors would need to be confident in a multi-decade tariff program to advantage US production over imports.

Other key stories

Trade tariff pressure eases – for now

The temporary reduction in tariffs between the US and China marks a significant de-escalation in the trade war, averting a complete decoupling of the world's two largest economies. The current tariff levels align closely with our Q2 2025 base case assumptions. We projected US tariffs on Chinese imports would settle at 34% by the end of 2026.

According to Wood Mackenzie’s Head of Economics, Peter Martin, should these temporary tariffs become permanent, both nations would be ahead of our projected timeline for trade negotiations. This could lead to slightly lower trade barriers than initially anticipated. However, the temporary tariffs represent a material increase in trade barriers between the US and China compared to 2024 levels.

The US-China agreement presents potential upside risks to our GDP forecasts for both countries. Our current outlook forecasts 1.5% and 4.3% growth in 2025 for the US and China, respectively. This tariff reduction could soften the disruption to global supply chains and investment patterns.

While offering temporary relief on higher tariffs, the reversal in policy adds to volatility and uncertainty. We caution that trade relations remain changeable, and ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the long-term impact on investment and economic performance.

Canada goes all in on nuclear power

Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has taken a final investment decision (FID) decision to build Canada’s first SMR. This is the first SMR FID in North America and is part of a wider strategy within OPG to build four SMRs by 2050. Funding commitments from OPG, Canada's net zero target and the renewed focus on energy security under Prime Minister Mark Carney underpin the country’s investment in nuclear power.

OPG's SMR plan will be expensive. The company expects total construction costs for all four SMRs to be US$15.7 billion, including control systems. We estimate that capital costs for the first 300-MW SMR will be around US$14,250/kW, based on disclosed OPG estimates. By the fourth project, our cost projections fall to US$10,113/kW – a 30% reduction compared to the first SMR.

The new landscape for gas-fired power

Expectations of higher load growth globally led to a surge in gas turbine orders last year – up 32% globally year-on-year. A “gold rush” is how one of the leading gas turbine manufacturers characterised demand for turbines recently. In our latest analysis of gas-fired power, Wood Mackenzie said that the gas turbine market could face multiple headwinds.

According to Ben Boucher in Wood Mackenzie’s supply chain team, global gas turbine manufacturing capacity of 60 to 70 GW is maxed out through 2030. There are market-specific challenges for natural gas into power. In the US, hurdles include rising capital costs for gas turbines, tariffs and low power prices. In Asia, high fuel prices and renewables limit gas to peaking. Decarbonisation in Europe results in a long-term decline of natural gas into power.

“This is going to turn on what the Senate does,” said Brand, about the future of the solar credits.","“This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.”

For the last two decades, homeowners have been able to claim thousands of dollars in federal tax credits to help offset the high upfront costs of going solar. Things were supposed to stay that way through 2034. But, this week, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed abruptly ending the incentives at the end of the year. If this idea survives the House and passes the Senate, it could upend the economic calculus of powering your home with the sun.

“It would put solar out of reach for millions of people,” said Glen Brand, director of policy and advocacy at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that encourages adoption of the technology. “What the House has done is to put ordinary Americans in a really hard place. They are basically saying they aren’t going to help people with rising energy costs.”

The country’s first solar tax credits took effect in 1978, but were allowed to lapse in 1985, when President Ronald Regan was in office. In 2005, however, another Republican — President George W. Bush — revived them. Lawmakers have extended and tweaked the incentives ever since, most recently with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which set the credit at 30 percent of the cost of a system until 2032, before a two-year phase out.

The average cost of a solar system in the U.S. right now is just north of $28,000, according to Zoë Gaston, a principal analyst for residential solar at the energy consultant Wood MacKenzie. That means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500.

On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee released an initial budget reconciliation proposal that would roll back large swaths of the IRA, including support for residential solar. The so-called 25D tax credit would still apply for systems that are installed this year, and then it would go away completely.

Without the tax credits, solar systems might still make financial sense in places that get a lot of sun or have high electricity prices, or both, but the payback period will likely grow. For other people, the math may no longer work at all.

“We would expect sales and installation to surge this year, followed by a market contraction,” said Gaston. “If a homeowner is thinking about solar and can afford it,” now would be the time.”

The 25D credit isn’t the only relevant tax break under threat. Another credit, 48E, is available to businesses that install solar on homes where the resident then either leases the equipment or enters into a power purchase agreement. This allows companies to reduce what they charge customers. According to Gaston, more than half of residential installations now follow this third-party ownership model.

Instead of eliminating 48E, the House favors applying limits on where the material in photovoltaic panels comes from. While experts are still sorting out exactly what the proposed language means, it generally aims to bar participation of “foreign entities of concern” — including those in China, where the vast majority of solar components are made.

“It puts the obligation on the installer or the developer to trace back the supply chain in a way that’s completely impossible,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. This, he said, could effectively make the 48E credit effectively impossible to access starting in 2026.

The current House language could at least temporarily push folks toward the third-party ownership options, said Gaston. But when Wood MacKenzie did an analysis, before the House draft, that assumed a phase out of credits by 2028, it still projected a 30 percent drop in installed residential capacity by the end of the decade.

“It’s going to be devastating for companies, their employees, and their customers,” said Gallagher. “It’ll kill an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of workers and tens of billions of dollars in investment every year.”

The House move isn’t the only headwind the solar industry is facing. Some states, most notably California, for example, have lowered the amount the homeowners can earn selling power to the grid, making solar less lucrative. Even before Republicans took control of Congress and the White House, companies were starting to let employees go. More layoffs have ensued.

Some Republicans have acknowledged the role that energy tax credits play in the economy, and their districts. Twenty-one House members of the party signed a letter to Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith expressing concern about “disruptive changes to our nation’s energy tax structure.” Four Republican Senators also wrote to Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, urging “a targeted, pragmatic approach” to any changes.

“This is going to turn on what the Senate does,” said Brand, about the future of the solar credits. He believes it’s unlikely that the House proposal will become law in its current form and is optimistic that the rollbacks will be rectified. “This is a piece the Senate can get right.”

But the harm to the solar industry is already being done, said Jacquelyn Pless, a professor who researches energy and environmental economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The constant back and forth over policy, she said, makes it extremely difficult for companies to plan ahead.

“Policy volatility is really my bigger concern,” Pless said. “Policy uncertainty alone can start to freeze investment, raise costs, and damage market confidence.”

Cook. “This program transforms liabilities into cherished community assets, building a stronger, more prosperous future for all.”

“The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) is honored to be awarded FY25 Brownfields grant funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in support of required environmental assessments for future developments at our Kakaʻako Makai, the site of a former municipal landfill, and Iwilei properties,” said Office of Hawaiian Affairs CEO Stacy Ferreira. “This critical investment strengthens OHA’s ability to steward these culturally and strategically significant lands with transparency, environmental responsibility, and community trust.”

“These assessments will help us identify and address any environmental conditions early in the planning process, ensuring that future uses of the parcels are safe, informed, and aligned with both public health and Native Hawaiian values,” said Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees Chairperson Kaialiʻi Kahele. “We mahalo the EPA … for recognizing the importance of Native Hawaiian land stewardship in urban Honolulu.”

Federal grant recipients must satisfy legal and administrative requirements to receive funds from EPA. The Brownfield Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup Grants being announced nationwide include:

$121.8 million for 148 selectees for Assessment Grants, which will provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments, and community outreach.

$88.6 million for 51 selectees for Cleanup Grants, which will provide funding to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites owned by the recipient.

$15 million for 15 selectees for Revolving Loan Fund grants that will provide funding for recipients to offer loans and subgrants to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites.

Brownfields Supplemental Revolving Loan Fund Grants being announced across the U.S. include:

$42 million for 34 high-performing recipients to help communities continue their work to carry out cleanup and redevelopment projects on contaminated brownfield properties. Supplemental funding for Revolving Loan Fund Grants is available to recipients that have depleted their funds and have viable cleanup projects ready for work.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

By Eric Starkman

Let’s hope U.S. auto writers don’t fatally choke on the free-range egg splattered across their collective faces.

For more than three years, mainstream and trade auto journalists have promoted the false narrative that GM CEO Mary Barra is a “transformative” environmental leader boldly disrupting a complacent auto industry and championing the adoption of electric vehicles. Fortune last year named Barra America’s most powerful female business leader, citing her EV credentials, and the year before, ranked her alongside Elon Musk as one of the auto industry’s top disruptors.

InsideEVs even named Barra its 2024 Person of the Year.

“Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday,” gushed editor Patrick George. “That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs Breakthrough Awards’ Person of the Year for 2024.”

Barra’s leadership may indeed be studied in business schools—but likely as a cautionary tale. Her story is one of chasing prevailing political winds and making strategic pivots based on short-term optics, all while relying on the expectation that U.S. taxpayers will endlessly subsidize GM’s operations, including its faltering EV ambitions.

After Joe Biden—whom Politico reported had a close relationship with Barra—was elected, Barra styled herself as an EV evangelist. She pledged to make GM an all-electric manufacturer by 2035 and embraced Biden’s climate agenda.

“As Chairman and CEO of General Motors, I now have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to use my engineering mindset to help make the world a better place on a much larger scale,” she said. “At General Motors, we have a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It is our north star that guides everything we do.”

Falling Short

Barra’s results have so far fallen far short of her stated goals and objectives.

Barra famously predicted GM would outsell Tesla in EVs by the end of 2025. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla sold 336,681 EVs, while GM moved just 31,886. Even though GM’s EV sales nearly doubled, they still made up just 5% of the company’s total U.S. volume—well below the national average of 7% for EVs overall.

In California, the most EV-friendly state in the country, GM’s performance has been especially dismal. Even the Tesla Cybertruck—dismissed by the media as a commercial failure—outsold most of GM’s electric offerings in Q1. The one exception: the Equinox EV, which qualifies for generous U.S. tax credits despite being manufactured in Mexico, and beginning in 2025, with key parts sourced from Mexico and South Korea.

Now, in what amounts to a tacit admission of failure, Barra appears to have shifted course again—this time siding with the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken California’s aggressive EV mandates.

According to the Wall Street Journal, GM urged thousands of its white-collar employees in Michigan to contact U.S. senators in support of legislation that would overturn California’s landmark rule banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035—a mandate since adopted by 11 other states.

“We need your help!” read the GM email. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

A GM spokeswoman, who the Journal unfortunately didn’t identify, said GM wants to protect “consumer choice.” That’s comical, given that five years ago, Barra pledged to eliminate gas-powered options entirely by 2035.

This isn’t Barra’s first alignment with a Trump-era environmental rollback.

In 2019, the Trump administration moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own stricter emissions standards—a power the state had exercised for decades to accelerate clean vehicle adoption. Rather than standing with California and other environmentally forward states, GM backed the Trump administration, joining a coalition supporting efforts to weaken federal fuel economy rules and undercut California’s regulatory independence.

By contrast, Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen signed a voluntary agreement with California to meet tougher emissions targets. GM’s position sparked swift backlash from Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates, who rightly accused Barra of hypocrisy.

When President Biden took office, Barra reversed course again—rebranding herself as a climate ally. Just months after Biden assumed command, Barra announced a $1 billion investment to convert GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico for electric vehicle production. The move infuriated the United Auto Workers, who saw it as a betrayal of American labor.

“At a time when General Motors is asking for a significant investment by the U.S. government in subsidizing electric vehicles, this is a slap in the face for not only UAW members and their families but also for U.S. taxpayers and the American workforce,” former UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in response. “GM automobiles made in Mexico are sold in the United States and should be made right here, employing American workers. That is why our nation is investing in these companies. Taxpayer money should not go to companies that utilize labor outside the U.S. while benefiting from American government subsidies. This is not the America any of us signed on for. Frankly, it is unseemly.”

Trump's Tariffs

Even more unseemly: Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which extended generous tax breaks to EVs built in Mexico—including the Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Optiq. If not for Trump-era tariffs, Barra likely would have shifted even more EV production to Mexico, where GM is the country’s largest automaker.

Barra’s latest pivot is no surprise. GM last fall abandoned its self-imposed goal of building 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and has twice delayed the reopening of its Lake Orion plant, which was slated to produce the electric Silverado. The company also pushed back the launch of a new Buick plug-in hybrid.

Notably, nearly half of GM’s Buick dealers took buyouts in 2023 rather than invest in the infrastructure needed to sell and service EVs—suggesting they may have had a better read on consumer demand than Barra herself.

Still, GM’s latest retreat from its electrification targets hasn’t sparked any humility within its leadership ranks.

Last week, Dave Richardson, a former Apple executive who now oversees software at GM, told reporters the company is working on a breakthrough called “mechatronics”—a system that integrates mechanical, electrical, and computing systems in vehicles. Tesla has been deploying this type of technology for more than a decade.

Given Richardson’s background, one might assume that integrating GM’s vehicle apps with the Apple Watch would be an easy win. Yet the project has been suspended because of glitches -- while Tesla rolled out seamless Apple Watch integration last December.

Meanwhile, GM claims to have made a significant advancement in battery technology with its lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which reportedly offers 30% greater energy density at the same production cost and helps reduce reliance on Chinese intellectual property.

“LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. He added that the new chemistry would “advance American battery innovation and create jobs well into the future.”

Silicon Valley Hotshots

Kelty, formerly of Tesla and Panasonic, and Richardson are among several Silicon Valley hotshots recruited by Barra to help recast GM as a tech-forward company. Yet while GM’s top tech leadership is based in California, Barra insists the company’s headquarters remains in Detroit—even though CNBC recently reported that President Mark Reuss’s office is located at the Warren Tech Center.

Every media interview I’ve read with Barra the reporter noted that it was conducted at GM’s Tech Center.

Richardson and Kelty have been with GM for less than two years. Time will tell whether they stick around. Notably, Barra last year trumpeted the hiring of JP Clausen, another ex-Tesla executive, to lead GM’s global manufacturing.

“JP’s unique expertise in global manufacturing innovation, engineering, and operations will accelerate our ability to deliver on our vision for GM with the highest quality vehicles for our customers,” Barra said in a press release.

Clausen recently disclosed on LinkedIn that he had left GM, citing that the decision “makes sense for me and my family right now.”",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_mary_7_58037.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:02:53.999000

Climate United lawyer Adam Unikowksy said the situation was growing dire for Climate United and other nonprofit green banks established under the GGRF, but maintaining the status quo was better than shunting the matter to federal claims court, which could take years to litigate.
As such, the matter should be decided in federal claims court, not the Court of Appeals or other traditional avenues.
When JUDGE suggested green banks might reorganize years later if they won in federal claims court, Unikowsky dismissed the possibility.
“They're probably not going to come back.” Climate United CEO Beth Bafford told Tribal Business News the organization would continue to fight to resume funding their work.","Lawyers for three nonprofit “green banks” attempted to preserve a court injunction blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from terminating their grants during a hearing Monday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The case centers on $20 billion in clean-energy funding, frozen in mid-February amid EPA questions about oversight and potential fraud, per prior Tribal Business News reporting. The agency later escalated on March 18 by terminating the grants entirely, prompting a flurry of lawsuits from affected grantees. District courts quickly enjoined the EPA from clawing back the funding, including $1.5 billion committed to Indian Country projects.

To quickly facilitate access to the funding under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the Biden administration placed the money in accounts at Citibank, N.A. With the injunction in place, the money sits frozen in those accounts, untouchable by the grantees or the EPA.

Climate United lawyer Adam Unikowksy said the situation was growing dire for Climate United and other nonprofit green banks established under the GGRF, but maintaining the status quo was better than shunting the matter to federal claims court, which could take years to litigate.

“I think if the issue is still percolating in this court, potentially, this court could leave the stay in place,” Unikowsky said. “I think a stay would be appropriate.”

EPA claims contractual dispute

However, EPA lawyer David Roth argued that the issue was a contractual dispute, not a statutory dispute. As such, the matter should be decided in federal claims court, not the Court of Appeals or other traditional avenues.

“There’s all sorts of provisions in the contract about who can do what with the money and when,” Roth told the three-judge panel. “I think that the nature of the dispute is over the contractual provisions and the EPA’s ability to terminate under those contractual provisions.”

Climate United is one of three grantees under the National Clean Investment Fund, a $14 billion program under the GGRF

The small number of grantees, as well as their arrangement with Citibank, raised alarms at the EPA once President Donald Trump took office. The arrangement did not provide sufficient oversight over the funds, the EPA argued.

Judges question EPA’s concerns

Court of Appeals judges seemed to take issue with the EPA’s reasoning.

“What's missing?” asked Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard, an Obama appointee. “What is the concern, given that these grantees are subject to very strict guardrails, and if the money's misused they're subject to criminal penalty?”

Roth said the agency did not believe it had sufficient oversight over subgrantees down the line, regardless of their access to information about primary grantees.

“The EPA has the ability to see the money flowing out of the accounts, but they don’t have, other than in particular circumstances, a way to see how subgrantees are spending it,” Roth said. “The further removed it is, the harder it is to understand what’s going on.”

Unikowsky argued that the injunction fell under the Court of Appeals as a statutory issue. He stated that Climate United had title over the funding as programmatic income, since it had been released to Citibank already and was not being pulled from the US Treasury. In addition, the EPA’s termination violated statutory obligations under the Inflation Reduction Act, which established the GGRF in 2022, Unikowsky said.

During the hearing, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, repeatedly noted that Unikowsky conceded the EPA’s authority to terminate the grants, which favored Roth’s contractual argument.

Potential permanent impact

The judges asked what would happen if the injunction were lifted. When JUDGE suggested green banks might reorganize years later if they won in federal claims court, Unikowsky dismissed the possibility.

“We're just going to leave and aren't going to come back. Realistically, it's just not an option for these entities to shut down, fire or lay off their employees,” Unikowsky said. “They're probably not going to come back.”

Climate United CEO Beth Bafford told Tribal Business News the organization would continue to fight to resume funding their work.

“Today, the EPA should be celebrating new investments that create jobs, generate affordable domestic energy, and save hardworking Americans money. Instead, they are taking up a frivolous battle in court,” Bafford said in a statement. “This is bigger than our contract with the federal government. It’s about EPA’s lawless and indiscriminate subversion of Congress and due process to freeze our funds and terminate our grant agreement. We will continue to push forward so we can get back to doing this critical work.”

A ruling on the injunction has not yet been issued, and is expected in the next two weeks.

China is the biggest,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.","This intra-party rift has become a significant stumbling block for the GOP’s tax and spending bill, which is caught up in demands by hard-line conservatives for a wholesale gutting of hundreds of billions of dollars in Biden-era clean energy tax incentives. That push threatens to alienate moderate Republicans whose communities stand to gain from factories and other projects enabled by the tax breaks — and green-tech advocates who had hoped they could sway Trump by framing the incentives as the key to edging out China.

The message they’ve gotten instead: When it comes to winning on clean energy, Trump just isn’t interested.

“The second administration is really not about taking half-measures,” said Daniel Simmons, who ran the Energy Department’s energy efficiency and renewable energy office in Trump’s first term. “To all appearances, it is not a battlefield that they care about.”

Trump’s Energy Department confirmed as much in a statement to POLITICO that focused largely on oil — an energy source that the U.S. produces more of than any other country.

“Thanks to President Trump, America is leading the way in lowering costs by removing red tape and unleashing affordable, abundant, and reliable American energy,” the department said Friday, adding: “As the world’s largest oil producer, the United States welcomes a secure and stable global supply of oil that promotes economic prosperity at home and promotes peace and stability around the world.”

The White House referred questions about its clean-energy worldview to the Energy Department.

Trump officials have argued that putting money into green technology boosts China, which dominates major slices of the global battery, electric vehicle, solar and wind energy supply chains.

Trump’s zero-sum assessment of the clean energy market has forged an energy strategy even more reliant on fossil fuels than he pursued in his first term. Following this approach would jeopardize a U.S. clean energy manufacturing industry that is just beginning to sprout — and, green tech advocates say, all but ensure that China will command the global sector.

That vision is coming to a head in Congress, where Republicans are working to slash the clean energy incentives created by President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. While not proposing to erase the tax breaks altogether, GOP lawmakers in the House have floated tight restrictions outlawing Chinese sourcing in energy projects’ supply chains. Those limits would render most of the tax credits unusable for projects that have not yet been built, effectively squelching the nascent U.S. clean manufacturing sector.

The changes remain in limbo as part of the broader budget reconciliation bill, the legislative vehicle for greenlighting Republicans’ and Trump’s policy agenda that can pass with a simple majority vote in Congress. House Republicans are trying to forge a compromise among fiscal conservatives and blocs of GOP lawmakers that want to preserve clean energy credits and raise tax deductions caps for state and local taxes.

Trump’s presence looms over the negotiations. He has repeatedly vowed to end Biden’s programs — the nation’s largest-ever investment in clean energy and fighting climate change — while labeling them the “green new scam.” Cutting many of those policies, such as consumer credits to purchase electric vehicles, would fund a small portion of his administration’s other priorities, including trillions of dollars in tax breaks.

“They don’t see climate change as a problem,” George David Banks, who ran Trump’s first-term climate portfolio, said of the current team’s outlook. He added, “They don’t want to essentially create a jobs program for China.”

Defenders of the IRA tax credits say killing them would wipe out an American jobs program, one whose benefits would flow to heavily Republican communities as well as Democratic strongholds. Private-sector manufacturing projects seizing on Biden’s incentives had been projected to create roughly 160,000 jobs, according to analyses published last year.

Overturning the subsidies would eliminate a potential U.S. export market for solar modules and batteries that could be worth as much as $50 billion by 2030, according to another analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Other countries would fill an $80 billion investment gap left by shuttered U.S. solar facilities, electric vehicle shops and battery gigafactories.

Many countries stand to benefit from the U.S. vacating the space, the Johns Hopkins researchers wrote. But governments outside the U.S. would face risks as well: Those that fail to encourage clean tech investments at home could fall even further behind China, which would likely benefit in every industrial category.

The researchers also raised the prospect of a transition of intellectual property to China: As U.S. business shuttered, they said, foreign companies could purchase their technical knowledge at fire-sale prices.

Trump’s barrage of tariffs against nations worldwide would limit some of the advantage countries could gain by selling clean technology to the U.S., said Tim Sahay, one of the authors of the study. Still, he said, the upshot from Trump’s policies was clear — including for European allies that had erupted in fury over Biden’s use of protectionist tax breaks to move clean energy manufacturing to the United States.

“China would be the biggest winner but not the only winner. … The rest of the world wins,” Sahay said. It’s “basically the IRA in reverse. When the IRA passed, foreigners were like, ‘Oh my God, Americans are stealing our jobs and investments because of their superior fiscal space.’ Well, now the IRA is gone, then foreigners are like, ‘Well, more for us.’”

Some conservative clean energy supporters still hope they can persuade Trump to back tax credits that have sprung solar manufacturing and battery-making plants across Republican strongholds in the Sun Belt and Rust Belt.

Those advocates criticized the IRA for being too lenient on allowing Chinese content into the supply chains of products receiving the tax incentives. But they believe Trump would bless tweaks that tighten foreign content requirements to retain incentives that support blue-collar jobs in the U.S.

“There’s an enormous and rapidly growing market for low-carbon technologies around the world, and right now the U.S. is a secondary player,” said Greg Bertelsen, CEO of the Cleaner Economy Coalition, a business advocacy organization that promotes low-carbon manufacturing at the state and federal level. “There’s a recognition within the Trump administration that we need to be competing in these markets for these technologies.”

Trump officials have been making a very different case.

Last month, Energy Secretary Chris Wright flew to Eastern Europe to propose that ministers from Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and other regional governments join “Team Energy Freedom,” urging them to embrace oil, gas and nuclear energy and reject what he framed as climate dogma.

“Climate alarmism has reduced freedom, prosperity and national security,” he said, adding — in language that carried a particular charge addressed to former communist bloc countries — that it may be a Trojan horse to “grow centralization and re-establish top-down control.”

Wright’s subordinate Tommy Joyce was even more blunt when he told a gathering of 60 governments last month in London that the pursuit of climate policy was a gift to Beijing.

“There are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,” he said.

People outside MAGA world also acknowledge the dominance China has built over decades of developing its clean energy supply chains.

In solar, batteries, electric vehicles and to some extent wind power, “China started early. China is the biggest,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

These are the core clean technologies the world is going to need en masse in the coming decades as it shifts towards a cleaner energy system. And in all of these fields, Li said, “the Chinese lead is significant and irreversible.”

In the past months, for example, two rival Chinese companies — BYD and CATL — made potentially game-changing claims when they announced they had developed electric vehicle batteries that could get 400 or even 500 kilometers (roughly 250 to 310 miles) from just a five-minute charge. Tesla boasts that its “superchargers” can give drivers around 320 kilometers in about 15 minutes.

Republican proposals would also hamstring some clean energy technologies that the Trump administration has touted, such as next-generation nuclear, fusion and geothermal, according to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group. The proposed tweaks to subsidies would essentially eliminate the long-term price signals that early-stage technologies covet, eroding their business case. Beyond that, the administration’s massive spending and job cuts across federal agencies and science research threaten to constrain U.S. innovation.

Rather than focusing on clean energy technologies such as batteries and EVs, the Trump administration has so far made critical minerals the forefront of its strategy to combat China, said a State Department official who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Those efforts focus on extracting and processing raw materials rather than supporting the value-added industries like battery-making or electric vehicles.

The official said the administration’s opposition to subsidies for green technology doesn’t mean it opposes the technologies writ large — apart from wind energy, which Trump has made clear for years that he despises.

Apart from the current U.S. government, no other major power has determined that China’s dominance means that action to fight climate change needs to take a backseat. The Biden administration’s argument, one still being pursued in Europe, was that a targeted industrial strategy could claw back some share of those industries.

Those strategies have often come cloaked in pledges to make this country or that country a “clean energy superpower.” But Li said there was a danger of “making too big of a promise. A promise that cannot be entirely fulfilled.”

Li said he had long feared that someday a U.S. president would ask: If China’s lead is so big, “then why do we play the game?”

That is the conclusion being drawn in the White House during Trump’s second term. And it helps explain why the administration has gone beyond shutting down government funding for future projects and kneecapping agencies that deal with clean energy while reversing regulations.

Not even energy projects that have drawn big-time investment and are already under construction are safe. Last month, the federal government ordered work to stop on a massive offshore wind project that would have powered half a million homes in New York.

“What has surprised me is the extent to which the administration hasn’t just pursued an agenda but has thrown sand in the gears of the parts of agenda that they don’t agree with,” said Thom Woodroofe, a former Australian diplomat in Washington who now works at the Smart Energy Council. “Even when it costs American jobs.”",https://static.politico.com/e9/09/7dfe533a42899ca659859f8e3116/china-us-sanctions-66195.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:02:57.675014

South Carolina Representative Ralph Norman, one of four ultraconservatives negotiating the package, said House leadership had agreed to a proposal to end Inflation Reduction Act tax credits earlier than Republicans’ original proposal. As initially unveiled, many energy credits, including a tax incentive for clean energy production, would begin to phase out in 2029, ending in 2032. Norman didn’t provide a new time frame.

Article content

House Republican leadership staff told reporters Monday that a phase-out date hadn’t been decided, and it remained to be seen if it would cover shovel-ready projects.

Article content

The incentives, which include credits for electric vehicles, wind and solar power, nuclear power and other sources of clean energy, have been ripe targets for lawmakers looking for hundreds of billions of dollars to help pay for extending Trump’s tax cuts.

But there is no guarantee the deep cuts being proposed will become law. Moderate Republicans in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose a handful of votes, have called for him to make the cuts less onerous. Some Republican senators have said they don’t support the changes as is in the current House tax proposal.

Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and budget hawk who has previously said his support is contingent on the “full eradication of Green New Deal IRA subsidies,” said in a post on X Sunday that he still wasn’t satisfied.

“Importantly the bill now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies,” Roy said. “But, the bill does not yet meet the moment – leaving almost half of the green new scam subsidies continuing.”

Importantly, this kind of state-driven coordination reflects a broader truth: preparing the EV workforce of the future requires more than funding alone.
What’s Next: Telling a Stronger Story Participants agreed that storytelling matters, and expressed frustration with an emphasis on negative narratives in the EV sector.
“Persistent misconceptions and mischaracterizations cloud the EV sector.” “Firefighters respond to 400 vehicle fires a day.
With all these trends moving in the right direction, the EV sector presents a real opportunity to build family-sustaining careers in communities across the country.","States remain on the front lines of developing the skilled workforce needed to support the electric vehicle (EV) sector’s continued evolution and expansion — with career opportunities spanning vehicle and battery manufacturing and maintenance to the installation and upkeep of EV charging infrastructure. That theme was central at the recent convening of the State and Local EV Workforce Collaborative, co-led by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the National League of Cities (NLC), with support from the Siemens Foundation.

State and local leaders, industry partners, and workforce experts gathered in Detroit in mid-April to celebrate the Collaborative’s progress and chart the path ahead. As federal priorities continue to evolve, the convening underscored a central point: the urgency of building accessible, durable education and career pathways in the EV sector remains — and states have a critical responsibility to advance the work.

“Labor market data will tell you there are around 300,000 EV-related roles in the future, but we also need to look deeper into what types of roles the area you live in will actually need.”

“We need the right training, in the right regions. What works in one state or region won’t always work in another.”

This was a common thread throughout the convening: one-size-fits-all strategies won’t cut it. EV workforce needs vary across geographies, and state governments are uniquely positioned to align training investments, employer partnerships, and education systems to meet local demand.

Continued Alignment Around Shared Goals

Despite ongoing headwinds in the sector, including funding shifts and the uncertainty of EV-related policy, participants reaffirmed their support for the Collaborative’s original objectives. Those goals include aligning education and workforce systems, supporting data-informed decision-making, investing in pathways accessible to individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, and scaling partnerships with industry.

Attendees emphasized that these goals are essential to navigating the current landscape. Aligning systems and investments across state agencies, education providers, and employers remains one of the most powerful levers states have to ensure long-term workforce readiness. Whether preparing workers for electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) installation or advanced manufacturing, the Collaborative agreed that consistent cross-sector collaboration and workforce alignment are critical to keep pace with both industry demand and community needs.

Organizations like ChargerHelp and Women Who Charge exemplify what’s possible when workforce development aligns with real-time industry needs. Both organizations are forging cross-sector partnerships to recruit and train underrepresented talent for high-growth roles in EV maintenance and charging infrastructure. Their work underscores the importance of designing programs that engage employers directly, target recruitment, and provide wraparound support that make it possible for more people to participate and grow their career in this sector.

State Leadership in Action: A North Carolina Example

One example of state-level leadership is the North Carolina Business Committee for Education (NCBCE). As an inaugural partner of the Siemens Foundation’s EVeryone Charging Forward initiative, NCBCE works to ensure the state’s workforce is prepared to meet the rising demand for EV infrastructure installation, maintenance, and support services. Their team developed a strategy to map EVSE training needs across regions, identify critical skill gaps, and partner with community colleges and industry stakeholders to co-create scalable workforce programs that prepare people for these jobs.

This model underscores the power of state agencies working hand-in-hand with local providers. By convening public and private partners, including K–12 systems, community colleges, utility companies, and employers, NCBCE delivers on-the-ground solutions, and also builds a replicable blueprint that other states can adapt to their regional labor market needs. With a focus on developing training that aligns with industry needs, ensuring credentials are valued by employers, and helping a wide range of individuals access these opportunities, the initiative is grounded in both equity and economic opportunity.

Importantly, this kind of state-driven coordination reflects a broader truth: preparing the EV workforce of the future requires more than funding alone. It demands long-range planning, cross-sector partnerships, and responsive programming that can grow and evolve alongside industry demand. As other states look to build or expand their own EV workforce strategies, North Carolina’s approach offers a powerful example of what’s possible when state leadership brings systems together with clear purpose and shared urgency.

What’s Next: Telling a Stronger Story

Participants agreed that storytelling matters, and expressed frustration with an emphasis on negative narratives in the EV sector.

“Persistent misconceptions and mischaracterizations cloud the EV sector.”

“Firefighters respond to 400 vehicle fires a day. You don’t hear about it unless it’s an EV.”

To combat these narratives, consistent and fact-based messaging that is grounded in opportunity, safety, and economic mobility is essential to gaining broader buy-in and building the inclusive EV workforce of the future.

In 2024, the EV market reached 1.56 million in sales. The reality is that EV-related jobs are growing, EV adoption continues to trend upwards, and charging infrastructure is expanding. With all these trends moving in the right direction, the EV sector presents a real opportunity to build family-sustaining careers in communities across the country.

Now more than ever, clear messaging is needed to cut through confusion and partisanship. Framing this work around shared values like innovation, infrastructure, opportunity, and local impact will help bring new voices to the table and expand support for workforce development efforts.

Charging Forward, Together

Mayor Stephanie Piko, Mayor of Centennial, Colorado, and co-chair of the Collaborative, emphasized the power of local resilience, collaboration, and “borrowing from others’ playbooks” rather than building in isolation. “Let’s learn from each other, adapt what works, and move faster together,” she said.

Ultimately, the message was clear: state leadership matters, and the Collaborative is a powerful vehicle to support this work. “We don’t have to reinvent the wheel,” Johnson noted. “But we do need to roll it faster, together.”",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P4183317-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:03:05.270534

This week, I came across a Facebook post from a Rivian owner named Mara, who shared her frustrating experience applying for the 2024 Colorado EV tax credit after purchasing a 2025 Rivian R1S.
If it’s wrong, it may need to be corrected by the DMV before you file your EV credit paperwork.
What You Can Do If This Happens to You Here’s what I’d recommend if you’re applying for the Colorado EV tax credit: Double-check your registration.
Let’s Hear From You Have you tried applying for the Colorado EV tax credit for your Rivian?","You’d think that buying a fully electric SUV in a state like Colorado would come with a smooth path to incentives. After all, we’re constantly told that going electric is the future, and the tax breaks are part of the reward. But for some Rivian owners, that promise is turning into a paperwork nightmare that feels like it shouldn’t be this difficult.

This week, I came across a Facebook post from a Rivian owner named Mara, who shared her frustrating experience applying for the 2024 Colorado EV tax credit after purchasing a 2025 Rivian R1S. Despite submitting all the documents and proving that the R1S meets the weight requirement, she was still denied, with no real explanation from the state.

Here’s Mara’s post in her own words: “Hi, has anyone received a 2024 tax year credit for a 2025 R1S in Colorado? We were disallowed the credit because it didn't meet the GVWR for the light-duty passenger vehicle (it does, 8,532 lbs). When we provided the supporting documentation for GVWR, we were denied again without further explanation. We are appealing that decision, but wanted to see if there is some experience out there that perhaps we should be checking the box for 'light-duty electric truck' on our form instead of 'light-duty passenger motor vehicle.' We have looked through forums and see others have wrestled with the definitions and obtaining the credit, but didn't find any conclusive results. Curious if anyone has had success in claiming the credit and can explain their experience. Thank you!”

When the Right Specs Still Lead to a Denial

Let’s be clear: the Rivian R1S has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 8,532 pounds, plenty to qualify under Colorado’s light-duty vehicle incentive guidelines. So what went wrong?

The most likely culprit is the classification box that applicants have to check when applying. Mara suspects that selecting “light-duty passenger motor vehicle” instead of “light-duty electric truck” might have caused the rejection. And the scary part is, she’s not alone in thinking this small detail could derail the entire process.

In the comments under Mara’s post, another owner named Eddie shared this: “I also applied for the credit and I’m waiting on a decision. The registration has the wrong GVWR, so I’m assuming the Colorado DMV would need to correct it as well.”

That’s another twist, if your vehicle registration lists an incorrect GVWR, even when the manufacturer rating says otherwise, it could get flagged by the system. It’s entirely possible that the database the state uses doesn’t match up with Rivian’s specs, and that mismatch becomes your problem to fix.

The Fine Print That Trips You Up

There’s no public step-by-step for this kind of issue, which makes it all the more confusing. Mara submitted documentation showing the correct GVWR, but her appeal was denied again. No reasoning. No helpful feedback. Just a vague rejection that leaves her wondering if she misunderstood the form, or if the system just isn’t built for vehicles like hers.

And when you step back, it’s not hard to see how a new kind of SUV like the Rivian R1S doesn’t fit neatly into the old categories. It has the ride comfort of a luxury vehicle but the size and hauling power of a truck. As seen in this long-distance towing story where an R1S pulled a trailer 1,200 miles, it’s fully capable of truck-like work. So calling it a passenger vehicle or a light-duty truck both seem equally valid, and that gray area is exactly where issues like this start.

Paperwork Shouldn’t Be This Hard

If you’re in Colorado and recently bought an R1S, now’s a good time to check what GVWR is listed on your registration. If it’s wrong, it may need to be corrected by the DMV before you file your EV credit paperwork. Because as Eddie’s comment shows, the software Colorado uses to review applications may auto-reject anything that doesn’t align exactly with its own internal records.

Even though this feels like a minor technicality, the implications are huge. A state EV credit can be worth thousands of dollars, and for many owners, that money is factored into their budget and even their decision to buy electric in the first place. Being denied that credit can feel like a punch in the gut, especially when you’ve done nothing wrong.

And it’s not the only time R1S owners in Colorado have faced confusing or frustrating issues with their new vehicles. One owner shared how their 2025 R1S completely shut down while trying to precondition the battery, leaving them stranded in the dark with no warning.

Does the System Understand These Vehicles Yet?

There’s a broader conversation happening here, one that goes beyond just tax credits. EVs like the R1S are cutting-edge machines, and in many ways, the state systems we rely on haven’t caught up. Everything from DMV classifications to emissions exemptions to title paperwork can feel like it was written for a totally different generation of vehicles.

Just ask the owner whose R1S broke down suddenly after 2,000 flawless miles. Their story is another reminder that no matter how advanced these EVs are, the policies and processes built around them are often still stuck in the past.

A System That Needs an Update

When government paperwork becomes a barrier to clean vehicle adoption, something’s gone wrong. And unfortunately, that’s what seems to be happening here. Owners are left to sort out unclear classifications and file appeals without real guidance, all because a checkbox might be mislabeled or a database hasn’t been updated.

And it’s not just tax credits, another R1S owner recently reported a strange popping noise from their SUV after taking sharp turns, a mystery that even service centers were struggling to diagnose. While not directly related to tax forms, it’s all part of a bigger issue: Rivian owners are often blazing the trail in more ways than one.

What You Can Do If This Happens to You

Here’s what I’d recommend if you’re applying for the Colorado EV tax credit:

Double-check your registration. Make sure the GVWR listed is accurate. If it’s wrong, contact the DMV to get it fixed before you file anything.

Ask for clarification before submitting. If you’re unsure about which classification to check on the form, reach out to the Colorado Department of Revenue and ask which box applies to the R1S.

Talk to other owners. Forums and Facebook groups can be surprisingly helpful. As seen in this story about an RV trip that revealed a great fast charging station, Rivian owners often rely on one another to fill in the gaps.

Don’t be afraid to appeal. Just like Mara, you have the right to challenge a rejection, but keep copies of every document you submit and follow up consistently.

What This Says About EV Adoption in 2025

As someone who covers EVs every day, I’ve learned that the biggest barriers to adoption often aren’t about the cars themselves, they’re about the systems around them. The R1S is an impressive, capable, and forward-thinking vehicle. Even after being rear-ended, one owner found the repair process more complex than expected, revealing just how many cracks there still are in the infrastructure surrounding electric vehicles.

That’s why stories like Mara’s matter. Because they show that owning a Rivian, or any EV, isn’t just about embracing new technology. It’s about navigating outdated systems that weren’t designed with these cars in mind. And until those systems are updated, owners will keep running into obstacles that shouldn't exist.

Key Takeaways

Vehicle classification matters: If you're applying for the Colorado EV credit, double-check whether “light-duty passenger vehicle” or “electric truck” is the right choice for your R1S.

Check your registration for GVWR accuracy: A mismatch between what Rivian publishes and what the DMV lists can quietly cause your application to fail.

The appeal process lacks transparency: Even with the right documents, applicants like Mara are being denied without a clear reason, so persistence is key.

This isn’t an isolated issue: From charging mishaps to mechanical quirks, Rivian owners across the country are realizing that support systems still need serious modernization.

All of this raises the question: can the EV industry stand on its own without massive subsidies from taxpayers?
Meanwhile, even after the subsidies, Ford lost US$64,700 per EV in 2023 and US$32,700 in 2024.
(It’s also worth noting that Ford, with the second-highest EV production in the U.S., produced a mere 72,000 vehicles in 2023.)
Between 2014 and 2023, automotive production fell from 2.4 million to 1.5 million vehicles while automobile imports increased from $57 billion to $82 billion.","While Trump’s trade war continues to grab all the headlines, Canada’s electric vehicle (EV) industry may be steaming toward an iceberg, due mainly to shifts in policy south of the border.

Specifically, the Trump administration has withdrew from the Paris Agreement (and its net-zero 2050 framework) and eliminated the U.S. EV mandate, which required upwards of 56 per cent of new vehicles sold in the United States. to be EV and 13 per cent be plug-in hybrids by 2032. These moves represent an existential threat to Canada’s EV investments and the viability of the large EV battery plants under various stages of planning and construction in Ontario and Quebec.

Indeed, the Trudeau government, along with the Ontario and Quebec governments, negotiated several significant battery manufacturing deals, which included subsidies and construction funding totalling $4.6 billion for the Northvolt AB plant near Montreal, $13.2 billion for the Volkswagen plant in Saint Thomas, Ontario, $15 billion for the Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario and $1.6 billion for the Japanese battery company Asahi Kasei plant in Port Colborne, Ontario. (Although both Northvolt AB and Stellantis are reconsidering their EV battery investments in Canada—Northvolt AB is approaching bankruptcy and Stellantis thinks that current federal subsidies are insufficient to justify its investment.)

According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, taxpayer subsidies (a.k.a. corporate welfare) for these deals will cost Canadians up to $44 billion between 2022/23 and 2032/33. In the U.S., EV sales in 2024 were 1.2 million (7 per cent of auto total sales) buoyed by an EV tax credit of US$7,500 per new vehicle, which translates into US$9 billion in EV consumer subsidies that year alone.

All of this raises the question: can the EV industry stand on its own without massive subsidies from taxpayers?

In 2023, of the two largest EV producers (Tesla and Ford), only Tesla would break even without the EV tax credit subsidies. According to Reuters, Tesla earned approximately US$8,300 in profit per EV in 2023, and of the 1.8 million Tesla vehicles produced globally, only 400,000 were produced in the U.S. Meanwhile, even after the subsidies, Ford lost US$64,700 per EV in 2023 and US$32,700 in 2024. (It’s also worth noting that Ford, with the second-highest EV production in the U.S., produced a mere 72,000 vehicles in 2023.)

While Ford still plans to make EVs, it recently announced plans to shift production at its Oakville, Ontario factory from electric sports vehicles to gas-powered pickup trucks. The news came shortly after General Motors announced it would trim its forecast of EVs produced in 2024 by 50,000.

Clearly, U.S. legacy automakers are worried about overproducing against sluggish consumer demand, knowing that their profitability and fiscal viability resides in their internal combustion engine vehicle production lines. Numerous large European automotive manufacturers also saw a decline in EV sales in 2024 and are re-investing in their combustion engine production lines to protect profits.

Finally, beyond only EVs, Canada’s automotive manufacturing sector is in decline. Between 2014 and 2023, automotive production fell from 2.4 million to 1.5 million vehicles while automobile imports increased from $57 billion to $82 billion. Of the 1.5 million vehicles produced in Canada in 2023, 88 per cent were exported to the U.S., leaving the industry highly vulnerable to shifts in American policy (which currently include President Trump’s threat of a 100 per cent tariff on automobile exports).

The iceberg is in view. The new Carney government and our provincial governments must take stock of the decline in the automotive manufacturing sector, its near total dependence on U.S. exports, and uncertain government-driven EV investments. And they should ask if the push to electrify the automotive manufacturing base is in the long-term best interests of Canadians.",https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/ev-production-line-1440.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:03:22.790672

The statement comes in response to a 2024 draft study published at the very end of the Biden administration detailing the environmental, economic and other impacts of gas exports.

The Biden administration’s study comes after it paused approvals on new gas export projects, saying it needed to reevaluate the broad implications of shipping more U.S. gas abroad. The administration included a 60-day comment period along with the draft study.

On Monday, the Trump administration published a response to those comments — giving some clues as to how it would assess gas export projects going forward.

The Trump commentary did not deny the environmental impacts found by its predecessor, including impacts to air pollution stemming from nearby communities.

But unlike the Biden administration, it said that these impacts are outside of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) jurisdiction, and therefore should not be considered in its approvals of gas export projects.

“Natural gas production, processing, and transportation have environmental effects. Federal, state, and local regulatory requirements that are outside DOE’s authority over LNG [liquefied natural gas] exports include measures to reduce or mitigate any potential related impacts,” the Trump commentary states.

It also said that “the denial of LNG export authorizations would be too blunt an instrument to address the concerns raised.”

This stands in contrast with the Biden administration, which said that “Understanding the many environmental and societal effects of natural gas production and export …is part of DOE’s consideration of the public interest in reviewing applications to export natural gas.”

In addition, the Trump-era commentary also downplays the Biden administration’s findings about the increases in price that would come with exporting natural gas.

The Biden administration found that “higher U.S. LNG export levels in 2050 are associated with higher U.S. residential natural gas prices.”

However, the Trump administration described any price increases as “relatively modest.”

Overall, Trump administration official Tala Goudarzi said in a written statement that the response to the study “will allow DOE to close out this chapter and fully return to regular order on LNG exports.”

“The 2024 Study confirms what our nation always knew — LNG supports our economy, strengthens our allies, and enhances national security. Biden’s opposition defied reason and reality and hurt American progress,” said Goudarzi, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, in a written statement.

Environmental activists, meanwhile, described the Trump administration’s commentary as ignoring the costs of gas exports.

“No matter how hard they try to hide it, Trump’s DOE can not bury the truth that increased LNG exports are simply not in the public interest. The facts are clear, LNG exports raise costs to Americans’ energy bills, are disastrous for frontline communities, increase public health harms, and perpetuate the climate crisis.

In states across the country, renewable energy projects in the wind and solar sectors are generating millions in local tax revenue, helping to prevent future tax hikes, supporting American farmers with reliable land-lease payments and reducing energy costs for consumers. The show Landman misses the mark by pitting renewables against oil and gas in a world where the two can coexist as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy – very much like what President Donald Trump seeks. Our country stands to benefit from the good-paying jobs this America First energy strategy would bring. Michigan, for example, is home to more than 11,000 clean energy jobs, and the industry brings billions of dollars in new investments thanks to projects coming into the state.

Large-scale solar projects provide stable, long-term revenue for rural communities and landowners, helping farmers diversify income and keeping family farms operational into the foreseeable future — especially amid high inflation and intense competition on the global stage. These same solar projects are low maintenance, provide a stable source of energy to a rapidly aging grid known for its flaws, and, most importantly, can be made right here in Michigan.

Critics claim renewables are unreliable, but modern grid technology and battery storage advancements prove otherwise. Texas, for example — a state known for oil and gas and where the Landman show is set — ranks number one in generating power from solar and is among the top in generating power from wind. Together, renewables have the capacity to power 13.8 million homes. Thanks to renewable energy projects, local Texas communities have seen nearly $585 million in property, state and local tax revenues. Imagine these same benefits in other states. This is what putting America first means, not whatever Hollywood or the Paramount Network is telling you. Imagine what this could mean for Michigan. We could finally have our roads fixed!

The show’s opposition isn't about facts; it's about clinging to the past. But America's energy future is being built on innovation, investment and independence — things renewable energy sources are delivering every day. It's time to move past fearmongering and embrace the opportunities that clean energy provides. Our economy and our local communities depend on it — it's time we put America and Michigan first when it comes to energy.

WATCH: What’s in the first draft of the GOP’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ cutting taxes and spending

Speaker Mike Johnson met with Republican lawmakers shortly before the meeting and acknowledged to reporters that there are still details to “iron out.” He said some changes were being made, but declined to provide details.

It’s all setting up a difficult week ahead for the GOP leadership racing toward a Memorial Day deadline, a week away, to pass the package from the House. The Budget Committee, which just days ago failed to advance the package when four conservative Republicans objected, was able to do so Sunday on a vote of 17-16, with the four hold-outs voting “present” to allow it to move ahead, as talks continue.

“The bill does not yet meet the moment,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, in a social media post immediately after the late-night session. “We can and must do better before we pass the final product.”

The path ahead for Johnson is unclear as he tries to hold his narrow House majority together to pass the president’s top domestic priority of extending the tax breaks while pumping in money for border security and deportations — all while cutting spending.

Republicans criticizing the measure argued that the bill’s new spending and the tax cuts are front-loaded in the bill, while the measures to offset the cost are back-loaded. In particular, they are looking to speed up the new work requirements that Republicans want to enact for able-bodied participants in Medicaid.

Johnson indicated he wants to impose the the work requirements “as soon as possible” but acknowledged it may take states longer to change their systems. Those requirements would not kick in until 2029 under the current bill.

“There will be more details to iron out and several more to take care of,” Johnson, R-La., said outside the hearing room.

“But I’m looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions over the next few days, and I’m absolutely convinced we’re going to get this in final form and pass it.”

More talks are ahead, but Johnson is looking to put the bill on the House floor before the end of the week.

Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks.

“This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,” Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that’s what is happening here.”

The first time that Republicans tried advancing the bill out of the House Budget Committee last week, the deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers in voting against reporting the measure to the full House.

Those same four Republicans — Roy and Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia — cast their “present” votes Sunday.

Norman pointed to a recent downgrade of the nation’s credit rating in making his arguments for steeper reductions.

“We’ve got a lot more work to do,” Norman said. “We’re excited about what we did. We want to move the bill forward.”

At its core, the sprawling legislative package permanently extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump’s first term in 2017 and adds temporary new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and auto loan interest payments. The measure also proposes big spending increases for border security and defense.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, estimates that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.

Johnson is not just having to address the concerns of the deficit hawks in his party. He’s also facing pressure from centrists who will be warily eyeing the proposed changes to Medicaid, food assistance programs and the rolling back of clean energy tax credits. Republican lawmakers from New York and elsewhere are also demanding a much larger state and local tax deduction.

As it stands, the bill proposes tripling what’s currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year.

Rep. Nick LaLota, one of the New York lawmakers leading the effort to lift the cap, said they have proposed a deduction of $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the bill remained under negotiation.

“Deliberations continue at this very moment,” Arrington said. “They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.”

If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are also eyeing changes that could make final passage in the House more difficult.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/2025-05-19T041515Z_1358030204_RC2QKEAWCCJY_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-TAX-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 21:04:18.019159

The House Budget Committee advanced the package late Sunday after GOP leaders granted a group of conservative holdouts a number of concessions, but they did not say what those deals entail.

But Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said on social media, “Importantly the bill now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies under the green new scam.”

Four hard-line Republicans who opposed the bill Friday voted “present” Sunday to advance the package to the Rules Committee before hitting the floor.

And Rules says it will take up the measure at 1 a.m. Wednesday. That’s the earliest the panel can set floor debate parameters under certain procedural requirements.

Still, the far-right House Freedom Caucus posted on X that the legislation — as is — “does not yet meet the moment.” Roy said that’s partly because it leaves “almost half of the green new scam subsidies continuing.”

Leaders also have to contend with a group of blue-state Republicans who are similarly holding the line on state and local tax deductions. Another faction wants to see softer language on the restrictions and phase down of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits. And across the Capitol, Senate Republicans are watching closely, vowing to pursue additional changes to the bill’s tax and energy proposals.

“I couldn’t tell you what is in flux, what is fixed, what might change or not change,” said Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas). “As you all well know, this process is fluid.”

He said conversations with members and leadership would happen through the week but rejected the claim by Democrats there were “side deals” happening in backrooms.

“I don’t know anything about side deals or any deals, I just know we are at a place where we can take a vote today,” Arrington said, noting formal changes would be in a manager’s amendment at Rules.

Before the committee vote Sunday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) expressed tepid confidence, adding, “We never stop working on these things.” He told reporters “minor modifications” were made over the weekend. “Not a huge thing,” he said. “Wait and see.”

On Friday after the first failed vote, Budget Vice Chair Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), who supports the package, argued the hard-liners who voted “no” actually support “most of what came out of the committee here. There’s just a few remaining issues. But yes, we want to get there as quickly as we possibly can.”

The budget reconciliation package, which Republicans are looking to approve by simple majority, also contains public land sales, changes to federal rulemaking and deep cuts to climate-related grants.

Clash over IRA credits

For months, warring factions in the GOP have fought over how to handle the Democrats’ 2022 climate law, with moderates pitted against hard-liners. While dozens of House Republicans have signaled an interest in protecting parts of the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, few have made clear they would tank the whole package over parochial energy interests.

Still, House Republican leaders have already told hard-liners a full repeal of the IRA’s clean energy subsidies would cost the bill crucial support, POLITICO reported.

Last week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), who represents a toss-up district that also is host to a massive offshore wind project, approached Johnson on the House floor to request a meeting seeking changes that would ease the blow to renewable industry tax credits. There’s no indication the meeting has happened; Johnson’s office did not return requests for comment.

In particular, Kiggans and 13 others, have suggested a provision intended to disqualify Chinese companies from accessing the credits as too cumbersome. That’s a concern shared by many in the renewables industry.

“In general, we see where the Committee was trying to go,” said Yogin Kothari, chief strategy officer for the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition.

“That said, the language is complex and will take some time to unpack and there could be some implementation challenges that would result in unintended consequences in our efforts to reshore critical supply chains,” Kothari said.

As evidence of the division among Republicans on the IRA, the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs will hold a hearing Tuesday on the law’s negative effects to the energy industry.

One Democrat said the party failed to get through to voters — particularly Republicans in rural areas — about the benefits of the IRA programs across red states.

“There’s an intellectual inconsistency here: The people who are benefiting most from those provisions are the voters and the Republican colleagues who will continue to go after all the work that happened on climate,” said Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.).

“So what’s so hard in this moment is how do we as Democrats punch through to do a better job of shining a light on all that … because there seems to be a disconnection in the public,” Balint said.

Senators eye more changes

As House members spar over portions of the reconciliation bill, a number of senators have been mulling tweaks of their own.

Some want more aggressive spending reductions; others prefer a softer touch and could add new wrinkles to the process in the coming weeks.

Some senators could try to put new pressure on leadership to delay some of the tax credit phaseouts and other changes the House is pursuing.

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of four Republican senators who last month signed onto a letter calling for a “targeted, pragmatic approach” to the tax credits, suggested she has qualms with the current package.

Asked last week whether she would vote for the “big, beautiful bill” as is, she quipped, “As far as I know, it’s not beautiful yet!”

From the other side of the spectrum, Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah), who like House conservatives is seeking more savings, was more blunt. “There is still time to fix it,” he said in a social media post last week.

“We MUST deliver on President Trump’s promises to the American people, enact real, immediate, and lasting spending cuts, and eliminate the Green New Scam,” he said on X.

Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former luxury car dealer, said he prefers an outright repeal of the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles extending to all manufacturers, not just ones that have sold more than 200,000 cars, as the House bill proposes.

“Certainly, my inclination is when that bill gets to the Senate, that the EV subsidies need to go away immediately — not phased out and not [with] any kind of artificial limitation in terms of volume,” he said.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a Budget Committee member and the chair of the Senate Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, said he was pleased with some of the House’s proposals on energy and climate programs, including rescinding unobligated IRA funding for the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.

“We need to take all that money back and start over,” Kennedy said. However, he added he still wants to “change a lot of it.”

A rapid shift to clean, renewable energy will give us healthier, more vibrant communities today, and a more livable future for our kids and grandkids.","It makes no sense to dial back clean energy tax credits for solar and energy-saving tech

Wind and solar power reduce our dependence on polluting fossil fuels, with big benefits for our environment and health. That’s why it’s welcome news that Massachusetts ranked 5th in the nation for electric vehicle charging ports and 11th for solar generation at the end of 2024. Here in the Bay State, and in fact, across the country, renewable energy technologies have grown rapidly over the past decade.

Anyone who’s gone to the Mullins Center at UMass has likely parked their car under a solar canopy. It’s become commonplace to find yourself behind an electric vehicle at a Rt. 9 stoplight, and the costs of solar panels have come down to the point where local property developers are proposing to use solar panels to screen equipment on the roof of a proposed new building, instead of relying on other materials to get the job done.

Every year more Americans have gone solar or taken advantage of energy-efficient technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles that can run on renewable energy. Some do it for the environment, some do it because it makes financial sense. After all, many of these technologies pay for themselves over time through utility bill savings, but upfront costs can remain a barrier to wider adoption. That’s where tax credits come in.

Tax credits make it possible for more Americans to choose to power their lives with clean energy by lowering the costs of going solar, buying or leasing an electric vehicle, installing charging or making a home or business more energy-efficient. The incentives cover up to 30% of the cost of many clean energy upgrades. In 2023, 3.4 million Americans used these tax credits for clean energy or energy efficiency home improvements, saving more than $8 billion, and helping spur adoption.

These clean energy tax credits are popular, but despite public support behind the policy, some in Congress continue efforts to dismantle tax credits, with a ramp up in intensity when the House Ways and Means Committee began debate Tuesday on a budget proposal last week that would take away tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels or energy-efficient heat pumps at the end of 2025.

Some leaders are speaking out. In addition to widespread support among Democratic members of Congress, 21 House Republicans have written to the Speaker of the House and 4 Republican senators wrote to the Senate Majority Leader cautioning against a wholesale repeal of clean energy tax credits.

Clean energy advocates, myself included, have been working to show how America benefits when we get more of our power from renewable sources. From Cedar Rapids, Iowa to Anchorage, Alaska and Bakersfield, California to Omaha, Nebraska supporters of renewable energy are making the case. In recent months, the solar-powered headquarters of Crayola and Frank Lloyd Wright’s architectural masterpiece Falling Water have hosted solar tours to tell the story of how renewable energy is helping them. Churches and schools, as well as breweries, nature centers and hog farms are sharing their stories too.

We all benefit when we get more of our energy from renewables. The solar and wind power we’ve already installed in the U.S. have already cut health-threatening sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution from power plants by nearly 1 million metric tons between 2019 and 2022 – enough to prevent an estimated 1,400 premature deaths in 2022. These renewable energy sources have also cut global warming pollution by 900 million metric tons between 2019 and 2022 — an amount of pollution greater than the state of Texas emits in a year. Not to mention the reduced threats to our waterways such as coal ash spills and leaks of fracking wastewater.

A rapid shift to clean, renewable energy will give us healthier, more vibrant communities today, and a more livable future for our kids and grandkids. And we all have a role to play. It will take individuals, businesses, houses of worship, and others to help make the switch to renewable energy for a cleaner, healthier world; both through their own behavior and through their advocacy.

If you’ve already taken steps to power more of your life with renewable energy, I urge you to join the Voices for Clean Energy organizing project, which highlights the stories of folks from across the country who are choosing to take steps to reduce energy waste and power their lives with clean energy.

And if you don’t yet have your own clean energy story to tell, but hope to at some point, you can email your member of Congress and urge them to oppose efforts to take away tax credits for energy efficiency and renewable energy, so that it’s easier for more people to choose clean energy.

Power concludes that the continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues.","Despite uncertainty around future EV interest and potential economic headwinds hanging over the automotive industry, consumer demand has remained stable, according to J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study.

Twenty-four percent of vehicle shoppers surveyed said they would “very likely” consider purchasing an EV, and 35% said they would “somewhat likely” consider the purchase, both of which remain unchanged from a year ago, according to the study.

“Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, J.D. Power’s executive director of EV practice, in a press release. “To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable. Additionally, the industry should better educate consumers about EV ownership to ease concerns — many of which, such as those related to public charging, are less problematic than they might seem when it comes to actually owning an EV.”

Of those who said they would “very likely” consider buying an EV, cross-shopped an average of 2.9 brands, while those who say they are “somewhat likely” shop an average of 2.8 brands. J.D. Power found the same to be true in its 2024 U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index Study, which found EV buyers shopped three dealer brands compared to 2.5 for gas-powered vehicle shoppers.

“As more EV options come to market, this should serve as an encouraging sign for automakers because it’s an opportunity for them to gain a foothold and pull shoppers from outside their brands,” Gruber said, in the release. “This year’s study results also show that EV shoppers consider products from mass market and premium brands alike, highlighting the opportunity to capture consumer interest with brands or products that shoppers may not have otherwise considered.”

Charging station availability remains shoppers’ top concern, with 52% citing it as a reason for not purchasing an EV.

J.D. Power concludes that the continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues. However, while consumer rejection due to purchase price has dropped 4 percentage points year-over-year to 43%, concern with cost of ownership has dropped 2 percentage points to 33%.

The study also found that 17% of consumers in the 25-49 age range have an annual income of over $100,000.

“It’s an interesting dichotomy because younger consumers are the most receptive to EVs, but also the least likely to be able to afford them, while older consumers have the financial means but show less interest,” Gruber said, in the release. “Much of the recent growth in the EV space has been fueled by products from mass market brands, which demonstrates the pent-up demand for more affordable products.”

Midwest states are least enthusiastic about EVs, with the lowest shares of consumers who say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV living in Wisconsin and Kentucky (18% each), Minnesota (17%), and Ohio (16%).

J.D. Power says this is influenced by several factors, including concerns about EV performance in cold climates and the stronger loyalty of consumers in these regions to traditional automakers.

This year’s study is based on responses from 8,164 consumers who said they intend to buy or lease a new vehicle in the next year, and was fielded from January through April 2025.

Recently, some state governors have paused EV sales incentives and/or requirements, including Delaware and Vermont.

On May 13, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott issued an executive order directing the Agency of Natural Resources to pause enforcement of a multi-state plan requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet certain EV sales targets for passenger cars and medium- and heavy-trucks.

“I continue to believe we should be incentivizing Vermonters to transition to cleaner energy options like electric vehicles,” he said, in a press release. “However, we have to be realistic about a pace that’s achievable. It’s clear we don’t have anywhere near enough charging infrastructure and insufficient technological advances in heavy-duty vehicles to meet current goals. We have much more work to do, in order to make it more convenient, faster, and more affordable to buy, maintain, and charge EVs. When we do, it’s more likely everyday Vermonters will make the switch.”

Scott said he remains committed to addressing climate change, including advocating for more charging infrastructure, but emphasized that when it comes to transitioning to a low-carbon future, mandates are not going to be the total answer. Instead, using common sense and incentivizing technological advancements are necessary to overall success, and the new compliance flexibility is intended to reflect that reality, he said in the release.

At the federal level, EV tax credits remain in limbo, according to a May 6 Bloomberg article in which U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said House Republicans might end the credit.

President Donald Trump has made EVs a policy focus, including proposing to cut $15 billion in clean energy projects and subsidies as part of his recently released budget outline.

However, some automakers continue to move forward with expanded EV plans.

Last week, at the Financial Times Future of the Car Summit in London, Kia announced it would carry out the world’s first trial of a Battery Passport vehicle — a digital-first solution that tracks and analyzes EV batteries at the cellular level.

“The trial vehicle is capable of monitoring live data for each battery cell and uploading it to a digital passport,” said Jens Brech, Kia’s director of ownership experience. “This close analysis will help extend battery life, reduce long-term costs, and build greater customer trust in EV batteries.”

Kia also unveiled its PV5, the automaker’s first Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), and its collaboration with Motability Operations to develop a wheelchair-accessible variant (WAV) of the PV5. The PV5 caters to ride-hailing, last-mile delivery, trades, families, and camper vans.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, for instance, has an idea of removing only the subsidies for wind and solar but not for nuclear.
The nuclear industry, hopefully, has a better memory about that.","Last week, Republican legislators caused an uproar in wind and solar circles by proposing what amounts to a decimation of subsidies for these industries—and EVs as well. But the lawmakers did not stop with wind and solar. They are cutting incentives for nuclear as well. The nuclear industry is up in arms. It has AI movers and shakers on its side.

Last Monday, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce proposed phasing out tax credits linked to climate policies stipulated in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. This, per the Committee, will raise some $6.5 billion. The House Ways and Means Committee also proposed phasing out various tax incentives, aiming to fuel the expansion of wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other transition technologies.

Naturally, wind and solar companies were less than happy to hear this, especially since they’d been lobbying legislators hard in the months since President Trump took office. The lobbying effort has focused on legislators representing districts that have been on the receiving end of IRA subsidies and on scare tactics about job losses and a worsened outlook for “American families”.

Nuclear has also joined the push against subsidy phaseout with its own lobbying effort. According to a Financial Times report from Sunday, the industry has been lobbying Congress to stop short of removing subsidies for new nuclear facilities, and it has been lobbying it hard. One nuclear tech firm, Oklo, linked financially to OpenAI’s Sam Altman, for instance, upped its spending on lobbying by 500% on the year to 424,000. Constellation Energy, Microsoft’s partner in Three Mile Island, spent more than $1.7 million on lobbying in the first quarter, a 17% annual increase, per the FT.

That Three Mile Island reopening deal that Microsoft struck with Constellation Energy last year was one of the signs that nuclear is making a comeback—and a major one. Google’s partnership with modular reactor developer Kairos for 500 MW of capacity was another sign. Amazon was not far behind, buying a stake in another modular reactor company, X-energy. Meta is also in the nuclear game, seeking up to 4 GW in nuclear capacity for its data centers.

Data centers and artificial intelligence—this is what is driving the nuclear rush that has benefited from the IRA incentives that GOP legislators now want to remove, along with wind, solar, and EV subsidies. Artificial intelligence is pushing electricity demand higher, and the outlook for this demand is so unanimously bullish that the need for more generating capacity is taken for granted. The thing about nuclear is that it costs a pretty penny upfront, and it’s nice to have a part of that financial burden shouldered by a cooperative federal government.

“It’s hard to overstate the value of the tax credits on helping to de-risk early-stage capital and project developments . . . if the idea is to lead and dominate in this space, we need to use all the tools in the tool belt,” the chief executive of that Sam Altman-supported nuclear company, Oklo, told the FT.

The tools in this case are the investment tax credit and the production tax credit, among half a dozen others. They are essential, the industry argues, for advancing new nuclear technology, such as small modular reactors, which have enjoyed a lot of hype but have struggled to really take off. Yet the tax credits are also essential for large-scale new nuclear because of the price tag it tends to come with—and Republicans in the Senate know it.

This is the good news for the nuclear industry: Senate legislators who don’t mind slashing subsidies for wind and solar do mind slashing them for nuclear and some have already indicated the authors of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” would have to make some changes if they want it to pass the upper house of Congress.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, for instance, has an idea of removing only the subsidies for wind and solar but not for nuclear. “I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology,” Cramer said, per Politico, referring to wind and solar, on the one hand, and small modular reactors, on the other.

But here’s a twist: some nuclear companies actually welcome the threat of subsidy removal. “Industries that rely on federal subsidies tend to get stuck in ruts and less favourable towards innovation,” Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, told the FT. “I like the direction that the administration is taking on this, in allowing it to be private and faster.”

Indeed, businesses relying on federal subsidies tend to get stuck in ruts. Look no further than wind and solar for evidence of this. These industries are a lot more active in the lobbying push right now because they know they will not survive for long without subsidies—and they have long forgotten how to compete on the free market. The nuclear industry, hopefully, has a better memory about that.

“The expected outcome is to improve the knowledge of the PFAS life cycle in a farm setting,” the researchers wrote in the MSU grant description.
EPA also cut funding to a study on common pesticides called neonicotinoids, which are linked to pollinator declines, in rural drinking water.","May 19, 2025 — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has canceled grant funding to university research teams studying how “forever chemicals” contaminate soil and groundwater, including at least $3 million for two projects specifically looking at contamination on farms.

The chemicals, collectively called PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), are linked to a variety of serious health risks. Over the past several years, they have increasingly been found in farm soils due to the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, causing devastation for farmers. They are also now widely found in drinking water, in the foods Americans eat, and in pesticides, and experts say more research is needed to understand their impacts and find effective ways to eliminate contamination.

According to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) website, the EPA canceled a $1.6 million grant to Texas A&M University for researchers to analyze how plants take up and store the chemicals, and to develop monitoring tools for PFAS in fertilizer, soils, and irrigation water. It canceled another $1.6 million grant to Michigan State University to study how the chemicals accumulate in both crops and livestock. “The expected outcome is to improve the knowledge of the PFAS life cycle in a farm setting,” the researchers wrote in the MSU grant description. “Direct beneficiaries include farmers, agricultural advisors, human health and the environment.”

Additional canceled grants include a University of Florida study looking at how flooding might exacerbate PFAS contamination in water and soil and an Oregon State project to increase understanding of PFAS toxicity. EPA also cut funding to a study on common pesticides called neonicotinoids, which are linked to pollinator declines, in rural drinking water.

The grant cancellations, posted to DOGE’s website between May 6 and May 8, were in line with reporting The New York Times published last month that found the EPA was planning on cutting grants in the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program. Some cancellations were also linked to the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, where the agency is planning to cut staff by up to 75 percent.",https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250519-epa-pfas-research-grants-cut-1-top-credit-getty-images.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 19:06:07.552580

Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination.
The research The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil.
UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure.","With the brief window for fiddlehead foraging nearing its close, citizens of the Mi’kmaq Nation hope to collect the traditional food source this week from the Aroostook River flood plain to test as part of their research into understanding, and in turn reducing, forever chemicals in the food supply.

However, they may no longer be able to afford to do the testing they’d planned.

Following months of preparation after securing federal funding in September, the team received an email from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Mission Support on May 13 stating that their four-year grant had been terminated, effective immediately.

“The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” the email read.

The EPA terminated all of the ten grants it had awarded for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in plants and animals, including two others to Maine-based teams led by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the University of Maine. PFAS have been linked to long term adverse health outcomes, such as cancers and weakened immune systems, and their pervasiveness in agriculture is not fully understood.

The termination of these grants, each for roughly $1.6 million, are some of the latest examples of the billions of federal dollars the Trump administration has blocked despite already being appropriated by U.S. Congress.

“It’s complete overreach,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “We’re going to appeal. We’re also seeking legal aid.”

Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, UMaine awarded federal grants for forever chemical research

The Passamaquoddy Tribe also plans to appeal the termination of its grant, said Marvin Cling, environmental director for the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point. UMaine did not provide comment regarding whether they intend to dispute the decision by the time of publication.

The grantees have 30 days from their termination notices to make the case that their work is in compliance with the EPA’s priorities. But crafting that argument is complicated by the fact that the EPA has given contradictory statements regarding why the grants were terminated and whether or not they are in line with the agency’s priorities.

Conflicting agency response

In a statement provided to Maine Morning Star in response to a request as to why the research no longer aligns with priorities, the EPA equated the grants with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures.

“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”

There is no mention of DEI or environmental justice in the Maine teams’ research plans or overall objectives of the grant program.

“This is a matter of public health,” said Frey Corey, information technology director for the Mi’kmaq Nation who is a researcher for the Tribes’ grant. Corey has worked with the EPA since 1996 when he started managing natural resources for the Tribe.

“There’s been funding challenges over the years — there’s no doubt about that,” Corey said. “But in terms of how they’re operating, this is really unusual.”

Democratic U.S. Rep Chellie Pingree of Maine, who helped secure that funding as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star this response from the EPA was “not only incredibly disappointing, it’s absurd.”

“To suggest that supporting tribal health and environmental safety — in this case, by studying PFAS contamination in their ancestral waters — is some kind of ‘radical agenda’ is both offensive and deeply ignorant,” Pingree said. “How many times do we have to make clear to this administration that tribes are not ‘DEI’?”

The response the EPA provided to Maine Morning Star runs counter to the agency’s press releases in recent weeks, which highlight a focus on combating PFAS contamination, including through partnerships with tribes. It is also directly at odds with the response EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin gave to Pingree about the grant terminations during an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Thursday.

After Zeldin outlined that addressing PFAS contamination is a priority for the agency and him personally, Pingree asked, “Since these grants are consistent with the EPA priorities, do you know why they were terminated?”

Zeldin responded, “It’s an important program. It’s something that’s congressionally appropriated. The agency’s going through a reorg, so the way that the program and these grants are administered are going to be different going forward.”

In early May, the agency announced a significant reorganization with major cuts to staffing, especially to its Office of Research and Development, the part of the agency that provides scientific analysis on environmental hazards. Pingree has called those changes a blatant abuse of public health and the agency’s core mission.

Pingree told Maine Morning Star that she felt Zeldin’s response on Thursday was a non-answer.

“The only good thing was he did emphasize that he understood it was appropriated funds,” Pingree said.

But in light of the EPA’s response to Maine Morning Star, Pingree added, “Either Administrator Zeldin was disingenuous with me and our subcommittee, or he and his agency aren’t on the same page.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, also told Maine Morning Star she reached out to the agency last week about the grant terminations and is continuing to press leadership to get a clear answer about their status.

“Research into PFAS mitigation is critically important for our farmers and rural communities, work I am urging the EPA to continue without delay,” Collins said in a statement. “Terminating PFAS grants would be an extremely damaging development.”

Regardless of the reason, Pingree said she considers the termination to be illegal and unconstitutional.

She is encouraging the grantees to go through the appeals process but said she will continue to question EPA leadership on the terminations, including during hearings for the proposed budget, which outlines a 55% funding cut to the EPA that would directly impact the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.

Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination. It was the first state to require manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in their products and has established a host of assistance programs to help farms continue to operate while also protecting public health.

“It’s just doubly cruel of the EPA to take that money back from Maine when we’ve been such a leader in dealing with this critical toxin in our environment that we have so much more work to do on,” Pingree said.

The research

The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil. It also represents a new model that centers Indigenous communities who have deep knowledge of the land on which this work is being conducted.

The collaboration between the Mi’kmaq Nation, University of Virginia, Upland Grassroots and Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station dates back to 2019, when they came together to test ways to clean toxins from the former Loring Airforce Base in Aroostook County, which now belongs to the Mi’kmaq Nation.

The team has seen early success with using hemp plants to remove PFAS from soil — a process called phytoremediation. These are the findings that led the group to apply for the EPA grant to further study how this method and others can help reduce contamination from irrigation on farms, a well-known reality for Aroostook County.

After receiving the grant in September, the team began the initial phase of the research, which has three overarching focuses.

Randy Martin, executive director of the Central Aroostook County Soil and Water Conservation District, planned to study how irrigation from the Aroostook River causes PFAS build up in soil and then ultimately in crops. Martin started this winter monitoring contamination levels, watering plants using the Aroostook River and harvesting them for testing.

The Mi’kmaq Nation is focused on how widespread PFAS contamination is in the ecosystem, including medicinal and culturally relevant plants, such as fiddleheads as well as ash wood, which the Tribe has long used for basketweaving.

With the grant now in limbo, the team is planning to freeze these samples with the hope that they can still be studied in the future, as testing makes up the bulk of the cost.

Researchers at the University of Virginia created biosensors to detect PFAS, a twist on the idea of sentinel plants, which are alternative species that display visible symptoms of infection to provide warning signs. Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at UVA, said the grant was going to help expand testing to the field.

“Our work is directly focused on delivering solutions to farmers and communities affected, which we did and continue to do now,” Berger said. “It also provides crucial data for regulatory decisions, and offers industries a cost-effective compliance tool — ultimately safeguarding public health while reducing environmental remediation costs across all sectors.”

Before the EPA terminated the grant, the team published a paper demonstrating how one application of this technology could be used in monitoring environmental water quality and a report for growers that shows how PFAS accumulates in potatoes grown in northern Maine.

“We’re proud of how much we accomplished in a short time, and frustrated we weren’t given the chance to complete our work,” Berger said.

Berger, Stanley and Corey said the team is committed to continuing its research despite the grant termination. If it is not eventually reinstated, they plan to explore private funds.

The other two Maine-based projects had similar but distinct aims.

UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure. The EPA terminated UMaine’s grant on May 10, according to its website.

The Passamaquoddy Tribe, specifically the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point, planned to assess PFAS in water and fish from watersheds in Tribal and disadvantaged regions of Northeastern Maine to inform the health of those in the area who depend on recreational fisheries as food sources. The Tribe had been in the process of hiring someone to do the research when it received notice of its grant termination on May 12, Cling said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/planting-2.jpg.webp,N,,2025-05-19 18:09:09.763387

The decision by Judge Richard Gergel, a U.S. District Court judge for the District of South Carolina, represents one of the first final judgments in a case challenging the Trump administration, as it has fired employees, frozen funding and dismantled agencies, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center. The organization, along with the Public Rights Project, filed the case on behalf of the nonprofits and municipalities from Baltimore to San Diego. The affected groups received funding for climate and environmental work through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act during the Biden administration, as well as through separate federal programs.

“This is a huge victory for us today,” said Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center and lead attorney on the case. She said the order would set an important precedent and characterized the decision as “a ruling that reaffirms that the executive branch doesn’t have the authority to disregard Congress.”

Gergel announced his decision during a hearing in Charleston that came after the Trump administration, in a filing Friday, said it would concede to the plaintiffs’ claims on 32 of the 38 grants. The judge said he would enter a final judgment calling on the administration to restore the funding immediately. The order was expected within a few days. Despite the administration’s concessions, its attorneys indicated they planned to appeal over jurisdictional concerns.

In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs had claimed that the executive orders freezing the grant funding represented an “unlawful interference by the executive branch” and also violated the First Amendment, which protects free speech. Two additional groups later were added as plaintiffs to the litigation. The plaintiffs said they were forced to furlough employees and pause programs supporting farmers, communities and public health.

Among the executive orders the litigation cited was “Unleashing American Energy,” intended to stop money designated under the IIJA and IRA, which provided historic funding for climate change and clean energy initiatives. The other orders were “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” and “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative.”

The 32 grants affected by the judge’s decision Monday were awarded under the IIJA and IRA. The other grants were provided under a Department of Agriculture program called Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, which was cancelled in April over concerns about inefficient spending and alignment with Trump administration priorities. The Southern Environmental Law Center said it would continue to work to restore this funding.

In addition to the president, the litigation named as defendants several administration leaders and departments, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Trump initiative to slash spending, the Department of Government Efficiency.

Climate United received $6.97 billion, Coalition for Green Capital $5 billion and Power Forward $2 billion.
Following his confirmation, Zeldin indicated on Feb. 12 that the EPA would not rest until the grant funds had been recovered.
They continued requesting access to funds until Citibank informed them on March 3 that it had forwarded the request to the EPA for further guidance.
On March 11, the EPA sent three termination letters to the green energy groups.","WASHINGTON (CN) — A D.C. Circuit panel appeared doubtful Monday that the Environmental Protection Agency followed the law when it suddenly terminated nearly $14 billion in clean energy grants, citing potential fraud concerns.

The Justice Department asked the appellate court to overturn a preliminary injunction blocking the EPA and the Treasury Department from clawing back the funds currently held in the grantees’ accounts at Citibank.

The grants, part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program authorized under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, were awarded to fund efforts for clean energy projects across the country. Climate United received $6.97 billion, Coalition for Green Capital $5 billion and Power Forward $2 billion.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin issued three termination letters to the grantees, effective immediately, “based on substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste and abuse and misalignment with the agency’s priorities.”

Zeldin specifically highlighted an “absence of adequate oversight controls,” “improper or speculative allocation of funds” and “circumvention and defeat of key oversight mechanisms in the disbursement of federal funds.”

Adam Unikowsky, of Jenner Block and representing the grantees, argued Monday that the EPA’s justification was not factual because any grant recipient, including sub-grantees that receive funds to construct the projects, has monitored bank accounts.

“The question in this case is whether the EPA has the authority to just terminate the whole program and re-obligate the funds just because it disagrees with the decision of the prior administration,” Unikowsky said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard, a Barack Obama appointee, pressed Justice Department attorney Jacob Roth over separation of powers concerns sparked by the EPA's canceling of congressionally appropriated funds.

“EPA has been really clear on this, from in the termination letters and in every statement it's made, that this is not some sort of frontal assault on the appropriation or Congress’s objective,” Roth said. “There’s a whole series of grants, like the solar grants, that were not touched because they don’t implicate the structural problems with these particular grant agreements.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, a Donald Trump appointee, expressed concern that finding any separation of powers issue would set a precedent for a slew of constitutional claims anytime the executive fails to terminate a contract as specified by statute.

Unikowsky pushed back, arguing that Climate United and the fellow grantees’ claims were a special case because the EPA violated the appropriations clause rather than a usual statute.

“Suppose EPA simply announced that it doesn’t care about what the act of Congress says, it’s the executive branch, it has the unilateral authority to terminate contracts at will,” Unikowsky said. “I think that would raise some separation of powers and constitutional issues.”

Pillard noted that the facts of the case seem to undermine the Justice Department’s case, pointing both to Zeldin’s public comments and the EPA’s actions at the outset of the case.

Following his confirmation, Zeldin indicated on Feb. 12 that the EPA would not rest until the grant funds had been recovered.

During a Feb. 23 Fox News interview, Zeldin made clear what he thought about the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, stating “the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.”

According to the grantees, they first learned their funds had been frozen in mid-February when they placed their regular request to Citibank to release the funds but received no response.

They continued requesting access to funds until Citibank informed them on March 3 that it had forwarded the request to the EPA for further guidance. During this time, the EPA did not respond to similar requests from the plaintiffs.

The agency offered to meet with Climate United around Feb. 24, then rescheduled the meeting three times before ultimately canceling without explanation.

On March 4, the Treasury instructed Citibank not to disburse the funds through March 9, after which the EPA ordered the freeze to be continued indefinitely.

Climate United sued, seeking a temporary restraining order on March 8, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for March 12. On March 11, the EPA sent three termination letters to the green energy groups.

Chutkan, an Obama appointee, granted the temporary restraining order on March 18, then granted a preliminary injunction on April 15, finding that the EPA had never explained its freeze of the funds or why the programs’ wholesale cancellation was necessary.

U.S. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, rounded out the panel.

The administration also will rescind planned regulations for other PFAS chemicals found in water systems.
What are PFAS chemicals?
PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down naturally in the environment or in the human body.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost everyone in the U.S. has at least some PFAS chemicals in their blood.","The Trump administration announced on May 14 it will keep the first-ever regulations on two of the most widely-known “forever chemicals” found in public water systems, including here in Indianapolis.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would keep the Biden administration’s 2024 regulations for PFOA and PFOS, but would extend the period for public water systems to come into compliance to 2031, two years later than originally planned.

The administration also will rescind planned regulations for other PFAS chemicals found in water systems.

Here’s what you need to know.

What are PFAS chemicals?

PFAS are a group of thousands of chemicals, such as PFOA and PFOS, that were made to manufacture products that are resistant to heat, water, grease and stains. Products include Teflon nonstick pans, clothing and other products sold and manufactured in the state.

They are also used to produce items like microchips and medical devices.

PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down naturally in the environment or in the human body. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost everyone in the U.S. has at least some PFAS chemicals in their blood. Some PFAS chemicals can stay in the human body for years.

Until 2024, there were no enforceable limits on how much of any PFAS chemical was allowed in drinking water.

Which PFAS are now regulated?

The EPA will keep a 4 nanograms per liter limit on PFOA and PFOS, some of the oldest and most studied PFAS chemicals.

They were created in the late 1940s by Minnesota-based manufacturing company 3M and have been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, lower antibody response to some vaccines and other adverse health effects.

State public water system testing found PFOS in Speedway’s drinking water at 2.3 nanograms per liter, a level below the national limit. PFOA and PFOS were also found in water wells used by the town of Speedway and Citizens Energy Group for drinking water.

Public water systems will have until 2031 to meet the new standards.

Which PFAS regulations will be dropped?

The Trump administration said it would eliminate limits for PFHxS, PFNA and HFPO-DA — the latter of which is a chemical more commonly known as GenX. All three are PFAS chemicals that served as replacements for PFOA and PFOS. If allowed to take effect, the regulation would have limited each chemical to 10 nanograms per liter.

It also plans to drop the Hazard Index, a formula that would assess how the combined levels of those three chemicals, plus another called PFBS, affect drinking water systems and require further action to limit their levels at water systems.

PFBS was found in treated drinking water supplied by Citizens Energy Group, and both PFBS and PFHxS were found in Speedway’s treated water.

PFHxS has been found in untreated water used by Speedway and Citizens Energy Group, PFNA has been found in Speedway’s water wells and GenX in Citizens Energy Group water wells.

The EPA has not announced when it would submit a proposed rule to eliminate these regulations.

3 Under the MCL Rule, the MCL for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water supplies is 4 parts per trillion and the MCLG is zero.

Notably, EPA now intends to rescind regulations for four other PFAS covered in the Biden-era PFAS drinking water rule. EPA plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize the rule in early 2026.

On April 10, 2024, the EPA under President Biden established Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)1 and Maximum Concentration Level Goals (MCLGs)2 for six PFAS (the MCL Rule), including PFOA and PFOS, which gave public water systems until 2029 to complete water treatment system adjustments and infrastructure upgrades, as may be necessary, to comply with the MCLs.3 EPA now plans to develop a rulemaking to extend the compliance date to 2031 and rescind the regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus PFBS. EPA also stated that it will support the defense of the MCL Rule with respect to PFOA and PFOS in the ongoing legal challenges to the rule.4 In its May 14, 2025 announcement, the agency hinted at “holding polluters accountable”, stating that “the need for a polluter pays model has guided a lot of the work to be done at EPA in the future.”

Environmental groups criticized the announcement, expressing concerns about the impact on public health and stating that the plans are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision.”5 Industry groups applauded the EPA’s stance as necessary and pragmatic. The Association of State Drinking Water Administrators responded that with the current 2029 deadline under the Biden-era MCL Rule, “states and water systems are struggling with the timeframes to complete the pilot testing, development of construction plans, and building the necessary treatment improvements.”

The EPA’s May 14, 2025 announcement can be found here.

1 MCLs are the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to MCGLs as feasible using the best available treatment technology and taking cost into consideration. MCLs are enforceable standards.

2 MCLGs are the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety and are non-enforceable public health goals.

3 Under the MCL Rule, the MCL for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water supplies is 4 parts per trillion and the MCLG is zero. For the four other chemicals, EPA had set the MCLs and MCLGs at 10 parts per trillion.

4 The MCL Rule is currently being challenged in the D.C. Circuit court by industry groups and utilities. See American Water Works Association, et al v. EPA, et al (24-1088) (D.C. Court of Appeals)

5 Section 1412(b)(9) of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended in 1996 requires that: ""The Administrator (of EPA) shall, not less often than every 6 years, review and revise, as appropriate, each national primary drinking water regulation promulgated under this title.

Clean air protections don’t hold us back, they help communities thrive.
It also limits the EPA’s ability to enforce clean air and water protections or hold corporations accountable when they pollute.
These moves don’t make us safer—they endanger lives and threaten decades of hard-won gains on public health.","As Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin prepares to testify before Congress this Wednesday—where he’s expected to downplay the real-world harm caused by his actions—his recent op-ed in the New York Post and public announcements offer a preview of the misinformation to come. Zeldin claims the Trump administration is cracking down on so-called “environmental justice scams” and refocusing on “real threats to water and air,” all under the banner of fiscal responsibility. But the reality looks very different. Under his leadership, EPA is systematically dismantling nearly core clean air and water protections, giving polluters a free pass while communities are left to bear the consequences. Here’s what Zeldin says—and what the facts actually show.

Zeldin’s Claim: Public Health Will Be Fine Without Health Protections

Zeldin confidently asserts that the Trump administration’s plan to gut 31 public health safeguards have “absolutely” no adverse health effects on people.

The Truth: Just 12 of the 31 environmental rollbacks proposed by the Trump administration could cause nearly 200,000 premature deaths in the next 25 years and trigger more than 10,000 asthma attacks every single day. These rollbacks include weakening mercury and air toxics limits for coal plants, limits for chemical air pollution from factories, and gutting wastewater protections for oil and gas operations. The estimates come from the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA officials sounding the alarm on the deadly consequences of dismantling basic public health safeguards.

Zeldin’s Claim: Eliminating ‘Environmental Justice’ Grants Is Justified

Zeldin criticized environmental justice initiatives, labeling them as “scams” and accusing them of misusing taxpayer money. He points to grants awarded to organizations like the Climate United Fund, which received nearly $7 billion despite being newly established.

The Truth: Getting rid of environmental justice programs takes away one of the few tools people have to stand up to pollution in their neighborhoods. (Even House Speaker Mike Johnson sought an environmental justice grant for his Louisiana district). Research shows that low-income communities and communities of color are much more likely to breathe toxic air, live near factories, highways, and waste sites—places where the air is harder to breathe and the water isn’t always safe to drink. These programs have long helped remedy those unfair conditions by reducing disparities between who has access to clean air, clean water, and a safe place to live, across the nation.

Zeldin’s Claim: Cutting Health Protections Will Drive Economic Growth

Zeldin and the Trump administration claim that stripping away environmental safeguards will jumpstart economic growth, especially in industries like energy and manufacturing. They argue that removing so-called “regulatory burdens” will lead to job creation and more investment—even if it means loosening protections that keep air and water clean.

The Truth: Pollution doesn’t just harm our health—it drives up healthcare costs, leads to missed work, and leaves taxpayers with the cleanup bill. And despite what some claim, it’s not necessarily good for the economy. An Earthjustice review of federal data shows that 14 major metro areas grew their economies while cutting pollution—including Dallas, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Detroit, to name just four. Clean air protections don’t hold us back, they help communities thrive. And in places already struggling financially, more pollution only makes people sicker and harder for them to get ahead.

Zeldin’s Claim: Firing Staff and Reorganizing the EPA Will Improve Efficiency

While Zeldin was firing hundreds of EPA employees, he also announced a major reorganization of the agency—including the creation of new offices focused on air partnerships, clean air programs, and applied science. He claims these changes will enhance transparency and efficiency

The Truth: Restructuring the EPA while slashing its workforce and budget undermines the very efficiency Zeldin claims to promote. Pushing out experienced staff and cutting funding weakens the agency’s ability to protect public health and the environment. It also limits the EPA’s ability to enforce clean air and water protections or hold corporations accountable when they pollute. At a time when pollution, chemical exposure, and climate threats are growing, hollowing out the EPA makes it less effective—not more.

Administrator Zeldin’s claims about the benefits of gutting protections and scrapping community-focused programs fall apart under even the briefest scrutiny. These moves don’t make us safer—they endanger lives and threaten decades of hard-won gains on public health. But Earthjustice isn’t standing by. We’re fighting alongside communities across the country to protect clean air, safe water, and a healthy future from Zeldin, the Trump administration, and corporate polluters.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lee_zeldin_2k.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 18:09:17.170905

These proposed new taxes on clean vehicles are supposedly meant to shore up Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenues, but they won’t make a dent in projected revenue shortfalls.","Clean vehicles are facing a triple threat from the House of Representatives, one that would harm consumers, autoworkers, and all of us who rely on cleaner air and a safer climate. The majority’s bill that would slash taxes for billionaires would eliminate clean vehicle tax credits that have allowed tens of thousands of Americans afford a new car; gut clean vehicle standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and impose a new and unprecedented fee on owners of electric vehicles.

Going after clean vehicles undermines a transition to electric vehicles (EVs) that is crucial to America’s economic success and global competitiveness. The United States is the global leader for attracting EV investments, with more than $300 billion in investments in new domestic factories to date. These investments are creating good jobs in states from Georgia to Michigan.

The combination of tax incentives and EPA standards is driving this transition. The incentives ensure that the vehicles are affordable, and the standards ensure that automakers deliver on their promises on EVs. In fact, this powerful combination of policies will save drivers $6,000 on the cost of owning a new vehicle while also helping spur EV sales and saving the country $13 billion a year from fewer asthma attacks and lung and heart disease.

Despite the benefits of these measures, the legislation passed by party-line vote in committees last week would gut both of these measures. The House Ways and Means committee measure would eliminate the $7,500 credit when buying a new electric vehicle and, in a totally unprecedented maneuver, the Energy and Commerce bill would overturn the commonsense and beneficial EPA standards.

Given the broad benefits to consumers and industry, the Senate should jettison both of these provisions as they make no sense.

In addition to the attack on incentives and EPA standards, the House proposal also includes a more novel attack on clean vehicles: a substantial annual tax of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid vehicle owners. Additional taxes for EVs, combined with a repeal of clean vehicle tax credits that make it more expensive to buy a clean vehicle, would significantly erode—or in states that already have other punitive fees on EVs in place, erase—the fuel cost savings that driving on electricity should provide.

Add to the mix already soaring vehicle prices thanks to recently introduced tariffs, and clean vehicles would be unfairly penalized and would become unaffordable for a large proportion of the U.S. population. State EV fees and taxes already overburden EV drivers compared to their gasoline counterparts. Thirty-nine states collect EV-specific registration fees on top of conventional vehicle registration fees ranging from $50 to $250, often far exceeding what drivers of conventional vehicles pay in state gas taxes. Some states also subject EV owners to additional charging fees and electricity taxes.

All these state and proposed federal charges lumped together mean that, on average, EV drivers pay more than double what gasoline vehicles pay. All vehicles on the road contribute to the maintenance of America’s transportation infrastructure in some way and people who drive the cleanest vehicles should not pay more than those driving gasoline and diesel vehicles.

These proposed new taxes on clean vehicles are supposedly meant to shore up Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenues, but they won’t make a dent in projected revenue shortfalls. EVs account for less than 2 percent of vehicles currently operating on American roads. If Congress is serious about returning the HTF to solvency, it needs to address the real problem: the fact that gas tax revenues have been shrinking as a result of inflation.

While the need remains to identify a long-term solution to generating revenue for the HTF, discussions about clean vehicles should be part of a holistic approach to funding transportation in the long term and should be included as part of the surface transportation reauthorization process, which dictates the level of money allocated to transportation programs and determines the sources of funding.

In April 2025, 34 environmental, health, and industry organizations signed a letter calling for Congress to oppose proposals to include new taxes for clean vehicles in the budget reconciliation process and to develop a fair and transparent approach to transportation funding through bipartisan surface transportation negotiations.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/woman-charging-electric-car-curbside-station-DSC00793.jpg?h=790be497&itok=g-PoSFJl,N,,2025-05-19 17:08:33.959969

By Eric Starkman

Let’s hope U.S. auto writers don’t fatally choke on the free-range egg splattered across their collective faces.

For more than three years, mainstream and trade auto journalists have promoted the false narrative that GM CEO Mary Barra is a “transformative” environmental leader boldly disrupting a complacent auto industry and championing the adoption of electric vehicles. Fortune last year named Barra America’s most powerful female business leader, citing her EV credentials, and the year before, ranked her alongside Elon Musk as one of the auto industry’s top disruptors.

InsideEVs even named Barra its 2024 Person of the Year.

“Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday,” gushed editor Patrick George. “That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs Breakthrough Awards’ Person of the Year for 2024.”

Barra’s leadership may indeed be studied in business schools—but likely as a cautionary tale. Her story is one of chasing prevailing political winds and making strategic pivots based on short-term optics, all while relying on the expectation that U.S. taxpayers will endlessly subsidize GM’s operations, including its faltering EV ambitions.

After Joe Biden—whom Politico reported had a close relationship with Barra—was elected, Barra styled herself as an EV evangelist. She pledged to make GM an all-electric manufacturer by 2035 and embraced Biden’s climate agenda.

“As Chairman and CEO of General Motors, I now have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to use my engineering mindset to help make the world a better place on a much larger scale,” she said. “At General Motors, we have a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It is our north star that guides everything we do.”

Falling Short

Barra’s results have so far fallen far short of her stated goals and objectives.

Barra famously predicted GM would outsell Tesla in EVs by the end of 2025. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla sold 336,681 EVs, while GM moved just 31,886. Even though GM’s EV sales nearly doubled, they still made up just 5% of the company’s total U.S. volume—well below the national average of 7% for EVs overall.

In California, the most EV-friendly state in the country, GM’s performance has been especially dismal. Even the Tesla Cybertruck—dismissed by the media as a commercial failure—outsold most of GM’s electric offerings in Q1. The one exception: the Equinox EV, which qualifies for generous U.S. tax credits despite being manufactured in Mexico, and beginning in 2025, with key parts sourced from Mexico and South Korea.

Now, in what amounts to a tacit admission of failure, Barra appears to have shifted course again—this time siding with the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken California’s aggressive EV mandates.

According to the Wall Street Journal, GM urged thousands of its white-collar employees in Michigan to contact U.S. senators in support of legislation that would overturn California’s landmark rule banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035—a mandate since adopted by 11 other states.

“We need your help!” read the GM email. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

A GM spokeswoman, who the Journal unfortunately didn’t identify, said GM wants to protect “consumer choice.” That’s comical, given that five years ago, Barra pledged to eliminate gas-powered options entirely by 2035.

This isn’t Barra’s first alignment with a Trump-era environmental rollback.

In 2019, the Trump administration moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own stricter emissions standards—a power the state had exercised for decades to accelerate clean vehicle adoption. Rather than standing with California and other environmentally forward states, GM backed the Trump administration, joining a coalition supporting efforts to weaken federal fuel economy rules and undercut California’s regulatory independence.

By contrast, Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen signed a voluntary agreement with California to meet tougher emissions targets. GM’s position sparked swift backlash from Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates, who rightly accused Barra of hypocrisy.

When President Biden took office, Barra reversed course again—rebranding herself as a climate ally. Just months after Biden assumed command, Barra announced a $1 billion investment to convert GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico for electric vehicle production. The move infuriated the United Auto Workers, who saw it as a betrayal of American labor.

“At a time when General Motors is asking for a significant investment by the U.S. government in subsidizing electric vehicles, this is a slap in the face for not only UAW members and their families but also for U.S. taxpayers and the American workforce,” former UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in response. “GM automobiles made in Mexico are sold in the United States and should be made right here, employing American workers. That is why our nation is investing in these companies. Taxpayer money should not go to companies that utilize labor outside the U.S. while benefiting from American government subsidies. This is not the America any of us signed on for. Frankly, it is unseemly.”

Trump's Tariffs

Even more unseemly: Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which extended generous tax breaks to EVs built in Mexico—including the Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Optiq. If not for Trump-era tariffs, Barra likely would have shifted even more EV production to Mexico, where GM is the country’s largest automaker.

Barra’s latest pivot is no surprise. GM last fall abandoned its self-imposed goal of building 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and has twice delayed the reopening of its Lake Orion plant, which was slated to produce the electric Silverado. The company also pushed back the launch of a new Buick plug-in hybrid.

Notably, nearly half of GM’s Buick dealers took buyouts in 2023 rather than invest in the infrastructure needed to sell and service EVs—suggesting they may have had a better read on consumer demand than Barra herself.

Still, GM’s latest retreat from its electrification targets hasn’t sparked any humility within its leadership ranks.

Last week, Dave Richardson, a former Apple executive who now oversees software at GM, told reporters the company is working on a breakthrough called “mechatronics”—a system that integrates mechanical, electrical, and computing systems in vehicles. Tesla has been deploying this type of technology for more than a decade.

Given Richardson’s background, one might assume that integrating GM’s vehicle apps with the Apple Watch would be an easy win. Yet the project has been suspended because of glitches -- while Tesla rolled out seamless Apple Watch integration last December.

Meanwhile, GM claims to have made a significant advancement in battery technology with its lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which reportedly offers 30% greater energy density at the same production cost and helps reduce reliance on Chinese intellectual property.

“LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. He added that the new chemistry would “advance American battery innovation and create jobs well into the future.”

Silicon Valley Hotshots

Kelty, formerly of Tesla and Panasonic, and Richardson are among several Silicon Valley hotshots recruited by Barra to help recast GM as a tech-forward company. Yet while GM’s top tech leadership is based in California, Barra insists the company’s headquarters remains in Detroit—even though CNBC recently reported that President Mark Reuss’s office is located at the Warren Tech Center.

Every media interview I’ve read with Barra the reporter noted that it was conducted at GM’s Tech Center.

Richardson and Kelty have been with GM for less than two years. Time will tell whether they stick around. Notably, Barra last year trumpeted the hiring of JP Clausen, another ex-Tesla executive, to lead GM’s global manufacturing.

“JP’s unique expertise in global manufacturing innovation, engineering, and operations will accelerate our ability to deliver on our vision for GM with the highest quality vehicles for our customers,” Barra said in a press release.

Clausen recently disclosed on LinkedIn that he had left GM, citing that the decision “makes sense for me and my family right now.”",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_mary_7_58037.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 21:04:31.297585

Absent from the plan are any provisions to end federal subsidies of battery production, provided the work is being done without help from China.
Trump has tacitly supported ending EV tax credits in the past.
But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.
While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them.","On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed lowering emissions requirements while also ending federal tax incentives pertaining to all-electric vehicles. This initiative is being led by House Republicans and would be executed under more comprehensive tax reform legislation.

The proposal is being reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee at the time of this writing and seeks to end the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and up to $4,000 credit for used models by the end of this year. However, the plan will allow a grace period (ending in 2027) that would permit automakers who had not yet reached 200,000 EV sales to continue taking advantage of the program.

Absent from the plan are any provisions to end federal subsidies of battery production, provided the work is being done without help from China. EV batteries produced within the United States would be fine. But any units manufactured under Chinese licenses or using components made by select Chinese companies will be deemed ineligible.

According to Reuters, this still sent some groups into a tizzy. While environmental organizations have become less enamored with EVs due to the ecological concerns surrounding the manufacturing and disposal of batteries, some of the largest entities still support them unconditionally. But it was the industry groups that had the most to say about the proposal thus far.

From Reuters:

The president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, Genevieve Cullen, criticized the proposal, saying that plans “to abandon U.S. leadership in energy innovation by gutting federal investment in electrification are catastrophically short-sighted.”

The proposal, she said, would deliver “an enormous market advantage” to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

The U.S. Treasury in 2024 awarded more than $2 billion in point-of-sale rebates for EVs.

There is certainly a case to be made that the U.S. would be foolish to totally abandon embracing new technologies. But it could just as easily be argued that China still has the most to gain from global electrification, regardless of where the manufacturing takes place, due to how much of raw materials required for battery production pass through its borders. China presently holds a staggering 70 percent of the world lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity. That effectively means Central Asia controls the global supply chain.

Ergo, China likewise benefited from the manufacturing incentives initiated under Joe Biden. But many of those joint ventures fell through as additional scrutiny was given to industry partnerships and those efforts have only ramped up under Trump. Still, billions upon billions in government subsidies have likewise gone to South Korean companies as part of subsequent joint ventures with U.S. brands to build batteries domestically. A significant amount of money is still technically being sent offshore to swiftly increase U.S. battery production and determining how much of that is necessary will be tricky for legislators who want to see more electric vehicles produced as soon as possible.

As part of the House proposal designed to curtain emissions and end EV tax credits, there are likewise provisions to eliminate some of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Programs, including those pertaining to battery production.

Working against the House Republicans’ efforts is the fact that the automotive-related inclusions only represent a fraction of what’s in the larger bill. It’s not inconceivable that other components could serve to undermine its passing. This is ultimately a budget reconciliation bill and includes items pertaining to cutting back Medicaid, numerous welfare programs, and loads of environmental spending. Bipartisan support likewise seems to be lacking and isn’t anticipated to come up due to how much the proposal targets climate and “environmental justice” initiatives.

However, both the House of Representatives and Senate presently have Republican majorities. The likelihood of President Trump signing off on the legislation, should Congress pass it, is strong as well. He attempted to reduce U.S. fuel economy standards during his first term on the premise that it would allow manufacturers to build less complicated and more traditional vehicles boasting lower price tags. He contended that this would simultaneously boost American manufacturing, due to the fact that those products could be less reliant on foreign-made electronics.

Trump has tacitly supported ending EV tax credits in the past. But the assumption at the time was that they would eventually exhaust themselves as part of the vehicle quotas they were attached to. However, the 200,000 car limit was done away with during the Biden administration (which made pivoting America to EVs a major platform) and EV subsidies effectively became indefinite, if manufacturers could adhere to the content requirements. That latter aspect is likely something Team Trump would have probably supported. But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.

While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them. The assumed reasoning is that Tesla was the first automaker to manufacture enough electric vehicles to exhaust the quota and has little to gain by allowing legacy brands to continue benefiting from government subsidies.

The final angle to this ludicrously complicated issue pertains to how the automotive lobby ultimately responds. The industry is incredibly influential in terms of setting policy and has some deep pockets. Whether we’re discussing restrictions on imported trucks via the “Chicken Tax,” creating emissions loopholes via the “Footprint Rule,” extending EV subsidies, or securing billions of dollars in bailouts after going bankrupt in 2008, the automotive sector has a tendency of getting its way.

However, the industry cannot control everything and even the best-laid plans can sometimes backfire. For example, the response to aggressive emission mandates from Western governments was to have the auto lobby help carve out special exemptions for larger vehicles and subsidize electrification indefinitely. While this temporarily boosted profit margins on just about every vehicle sold, automakers are now confronting a situation where a large amount of new product is out of reach for the average customer.

Small, affordable vehicles boasting superior reliability have effectively evaporated from the North American market. Tiny, increasingly complex powertrains are simultaneously becoming the norm and mandated technologies help balloon MSRPs. The push toward EVs has likewise failed to progress at a pace industry leadership assumed would be financially viable. While nothing can be truly assured, much of the public has signaled they’re not altogether pleased with the direction the industry has been heading and we’re starting to see vehicle sales reflect that.

It’s plausible that the industry would absolutely embrace a reduction in emission requirements at this juncture. But there is still a lot of free money (for lack of a better term) from the taxpayers being left on the table if the subsidies are done away with. Meanwhile, the fact that this is all part of an expansive budget reconciliation bill means it’ll undoubtedly go through numerous changes before the matter is settled",https://i0.wp.com/automotiveamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-10.png?fit=720%2C480&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-19 22:02:23.613614

And by growing role, we mean there’s plenty to talk about on Toyota’s hydrogen horizon.

And it’s not just in cars.

Stacked in the beds of Toyota Tundra pickup trucks, these mobile power generators can be taken across the country, from California to as far east as Florida providing cleaner power for a variety of events.*

“You’re using hydrogen, so you’ll have energy with the only byproducts at point of use being power and water,” said Craig Cauthen, who manages Emerging Technologies at Toyota Racing Development (TRD).

Generating a Speedy Process

In 2021, Cauthen and a handful of engineers on the TRD engineering team in Costa Mesa, California, were asked to develop a fuel cell generator system based on technology from the first-generation Toyota Mirai.*

“Once we figured it was possible, we said, Let’s make it portable. Let’s make it lightweight. Let’s make it easier to move around,” Cauthen said.

Powerful Events

The team recognized that the fuel cell generators could be used at local and Toyota-sponsored events around the U.S. that needed off-grid power.*

From live performances to racing events, these fuel cell generators have powered outdoor events nearly silently and with zero emissions at the point of use. Not only can they provide cleaner energy, but they’re also sensory positive.

“If you’ve ever been to an event, concert, or anyplace like that, there are always generators running,” Cauthen says. “These fuel cell generators are relatively quiet. You can have a conversation next to them while they’re running. You can power just about anything if you have a tank of hydrogen.”*

Spreading the Word While Moving in Silence

It can be an eye-opening experience to learn that a fuel cell generator can power so much while remaining virtually noise-free.

“From an R&D standpoint, we heard that TRD had this fuel cell generator in the Tundra and wanted to give it more face time with the general public,” says Debby Byrne, an executive program manager at Toyota. “So, I think from the advanced product planning office [APPO], we wanted to get more information about hydrogen and hydrogen technology, fuel cell technology, out into the public.”

Byrne adds, “I think a lot of people are familiar with EVs (electric vehicles) but not fuel cells. So, it was an opportunity to kind of take what TRD had done and then showcase it in different demonstration events.”

For example, the fuel cell generators had been used to power three food trucks in Detroit during a community event, delivering 10 kilowatts of power.

“Normally when you have a food truck rally, every single one has that diesel generator,” she says. “It’s loud and you smell those fumes rather than the food that you’re trying to eat. So, it was a good opportunity to partner with the City of Detroit to showcase this technology.”

Fueling the Future

Byrne also believes the future looks bright for fuel cell generator opportunities and more.

“From a global standpoint, Toyota has pushed fuel cell technology as something that is scalable,” says Byrne. “So, we really want to showcase how fuel cell technology has the capability to work in many different applications almost seamlessly.”

Added Cauthen: “Hydrogen fuel cells are a technology that can be used now. It’s not a far-off dream or a concept technology. Fuel cells can be done today. They are here.”

On May 12, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an interim final rule significantly extending the reporting deadlines for PFAS reporting under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The extension postpones the start of the reporting period by nine months—from July 11, 2025, to April 13, 2026—and sets a new submission deadline of October 13, 2026, for most manufacturers. Small manufacturers who import PFAS-containing articles will now have until April 13, 2027, to comply.

This extension responds to feedback from stakeholders and is designed to give EPA additional time to finalize and test the electronic reporting system. Significantly, EPA’s delay also provides industry more time to prepare for what many have described as a complex and demanding reporting obligation. According to its May 12, 2025 update, “EPA is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment,” and the “delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.” That statement, coupled with EPA’s April 28 announcement that it would minimize the burden on article importers and small businesses, may mean that EPA is already considering future rule changes.

Scope and Purpose of the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting Rule

The 2023 final rule marked a significant expansion of EPA’s data-gathering authority over PFAS. Issued pursuant to the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which amended TSCA to mandate reporting on PFAS, the rule requires any entity that manufactured or imported PFAS, including as components of articles, between 2011 and 2022, to report a broad range of information. This includes data on chemical identity, production volumes, uses, byproducts, disposal practices, worker exposure and known environmental or health effects.

EPA’s stated objective is to build a comprehensive inventory of historical PFAS manufacturing and importation in the US to support future regulatory action, risk evaluation, and risk management efforts. Given the growing regulatory and public health focus on PFAS as a class of persistent and potentially harmful chemicals, the reporting rule represents a critical step in the federal government’s effort to close longstanding data gaps.

Implementation Challenges and the Basis for Extension

In issuing the interim final rule, EPA cited the need for additional time to develop and test the electronic reporting platform that will be used to receive the required information. The agency emphasized that the extended timeline will not only allow for technical improvements but also enable regulated entities to provide feedback on the tool’s usability and to request clarifying guidance on reporting expectations.

Stakeholders across multiple industries have raised concerns about the complexity of the reporting requirements and the burden associated with reconstructing over a decade of historical data. In particular, trade associations such as the RV Industry Association (RIVA) have highlighted the difficulty for article importers—especially small businesses—with limited access to upstream supplier information. These concerns appear to have factored heavily into EPA’s decision to issue the interim final rule, as the agency acknowledged the need to provide reasonable timeframes for compliance and reduce the likelihood of widespread reporting errors.

Implications for Manufacturers, Importers and Article Handlers

The extended deadlines offer short-term regulatory relief but underscore the need for companies to begin preparing now. Manufacturers and importers must identify all PFAS that they handled from 2011 to 2022. Importantly, the reporting obligation applies even if the PFAS was imported unintentionally or as part of a complex product. The scope of required data, such as information related to environmental and health effects, will necessitate significant internal coordination and engagement with suppliers.

While EPA has not yet modified the substance of the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements, companies should not postpone their due diligence efforts to determine whether any such changes may impact their reporting obligations, as the delay is an acknowledgment that compliance will require substantial, time-consuming effort and that additional guidance and outreach will be critical. The final version of the reporting tool, once released, may also influence how companies structure their data collection efforts in the coming year.

Conclusion

By balancing regulatory objectives with industry feedback and technological readiness, EPA aims to facilitate more accurate and complete PFAS reporting submissions. The regulated community should view this extension not as a reason to delay preparation, but as an opportunity to carefully align compliance strategies with EPA’s guidance and technological updates. As EPA advances its broader PFAS agenda, including potential future restrictions and risk management rules, early and thorough compliance with the reporting rule will be essential.",https://www.mgmlaw.com/assets/images/mgm-og-social.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 17:08:37.290321

Energy Star’s 33-year run may soon end, however.

A recent Office of Air and Pollution (OAP) meeting alerted reporters to the Trump administration’s plan to terminate the program. EPA director Lee Zeldin, on May 2, announced plans to scale down the EPA more broadly, albeit without explicitly mentioning the Energy Star program.

AN emailed EPA in regard to Energy Star’s pending termination. “In keeping with a longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on pending litigation,” EPA told AN.

Zeldin said the White House’s proposed changes to the EPA could save taxpayers $300 billion, but didn’t give details as to how. Zeldin also said, “EPA expects to have employment levels near those seen when President Ronald Reagan occupied the White House.”

Jeanne Shaheen, Democratic Senator of New Hampshire, called the decision to terminate Energy Star a win for billionaires.

“Let’s be clear: Cutting the popular Energy Star program—which helps everyday households and businesses save on their energy bills—would mark another rash attempt by this administration to line the pockets of billionaires and utility companies at the expense of hardworking Americans,” Shaheen said in a statement.

Ted Kelly, U.S. Clean Energy, Environmental Defense Fund director, was also quick to respond.

“For more than three decades,” Kelly said, “the Energy Star program has helped American families shop for reliably energy-efficient home appliances that would save them money. Generations have looked for the blue Energy Star label in stores when they were buying a refrigerator or dishwasher and wanted something they could trust.”

Kelly continued: “Companies chose to participate in the voluntary program because they knew their customers liked it.”

After the decision was made public, over 1,000 companies wrote letters to the EPA in support of the Energy Star program. Vivian Loftness, an architecture professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said: “This takes us out of a position of leadership.”

In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, William K. Reilly, former EPA administrator, called it “a case of mistaken identity.” Adding that, “In its antipathy to climate activism, the EPA has taken an ax to that rare government program embraced by both seller and buyer, builder and environmentalist, because everyone comes out ahead.”

The announcement comes not long after other defunding efforts—Medicaid, for instance. The proposed 2026 federal budget deprives architecture schools and nonprofits of vital resources, as part of National Endowment for the Arts cuts.

Zeldin previously slashed EPA spending, taking aim at $2 billion in grants that would have supported sustainability initiatives, DEI, natural disaster relief, and environmental justice work.

The first is a revamp of Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards for certain PFAS in drinking water. The second is an update to Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) timelines for reporting PFAS use. As we previewed in our April 30 note, these actions are part of a multifaceted effort by the Trump EPA to update the agency's approach to PFAS issues, with likely more to come. This note provides a summary of the changes and how their implementation may proceed in light of certain congressional and judicial scrutiny.

PFAS in Drinking Water

On May 14, the EPA announced its intention to make changes to national drinking water standards regulating certain PFAS. In a press release, the EPA described plans to extend the compliance dates for two PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) but rescind regulations for four other substances pending further EPA consideration.

By way of background, in April 2024, the Biden EPA issued a rule to limit levels of certain PFAS compounds in drinking water. That rule established enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for six PFAS compounds: 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA and 10 ppt for four other compounds: PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA (a.k.a. GenX). Compliance with the MCLs was to occur no later than 2029.

In its recent announcement, the EPA said it will extend the compliance date for PFOA and PFOS by two years to 2031. The EPA also announced that it intends to rescind regulations for the other four PFAS compounds and will reconsider how they should be addressed. EPA states that this action is ""designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, all while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these."" The Agency plans to issue a proposed new rule for public comment in fall of 2025 and a final rule in the spring of 2026.

Reaction has been varied—drinking water utilities have been generally positive, as they will benefit from additional time to meet the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, while environmental and some health groups have raised concerns. The move drew immediate attention from Congress, where EPA Administrator Zeldin faced senators on May 14 who questioned the agency's plans to address PFAS. Zeldin defended the actions as appropriate and reaffirmed his commitment to ""fulfill all statutory obligations."" We anticipate legal challenges to the new rule, as well as continued attention from Congress in the months ahead.

TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting

On May 13, the EPA published an interim final rule to amend the data submission period for the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS reporting rule. Under that rule, manufacturers (including importers) are to electronically report information regarding PFAS uses, production volumes, disposal, exposure, and hazards for activity beginning in 2011. Reporting was originally to occur over a six-month window beginning in November 2024 but was delayed to July 2025 and is now being reset to April through October 2026. Small manufacturers have until April 2027 to file their reports. EPA states this latest adjustment is to allow for sufficient time to develop and validate the software needed to receive the required data.

Of note, the Federal Register notice states that at this time the only change to the Section 8(a)(7) rule is the data submission dates. However, the notice also states the EPA ""intends to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future that will, among other things, allow for further comment on the appropriate reporting period."" Just as importantly, the EPA indicated that more substantive changes to TSCA reporting could occur: ""the Agency may, in a future separate action, reopen other aspects of this rule for public comment in light of Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulations (90 FR 9065, January 31, 2025).""

When Congress created TSCA 8(a)(7) in 2019 by statute, it specified that reporting was to cover actions since January 2011. Any change to the covered reporting period sought by EPA would likely need action by Congress. The Agency has signaled interest in actions to reduce the regulatory burden, particularly on small businesses, including in its April 28 press release: ""Implement section 8(a)(7) … without overburdening small businesses and article importers,"" a possible reference to a de minimis exemption or other modification to the reporting requirement.

What Happens Next?

Stakeholders should remain focused on how the EPA moves forward on PFAS matters. The Agency, as it laid out in its April 28 announcement, will continue to evaluate the suite of PFAS rules and regulations as it looks to create its own path forward. In addition to the expected drinking water rules previewed above, announcements are also expected regarding the 2024 hazardous substance designation of PFOA and PFAS under CERCLA and other measures under consideration. Congress continues to discuss PFAS matters, including how best to handle CERCLA liability for ""passive receivers,"" and will most certainly remain actively engaged with the EPA.

All of these regulatory actions, of course, are being litigated by affected parties and the Agency, even as the EPA alters the rules at issue.[1] Those actions (and perhaps new ones) are likely to continue, albeit with new underlying legal and substantive disputes. We anticipate that litigation will continue for the foreseeable future.

It has helped families save money, cut climate pollution, improve air quality, and made appliances more efficient – simply by helping people make smarter choices about the products they use every day. Utility companies, manufacturers and retailers have used the Energy Star program to market efficient products and set energy efficiency incentive programs.

However, this critical program is on the chopping block.

Current administration officials recently announced to their staff that Energy Star would be eliminated. This move would gut one of the most effective and bipartisan tools for fighting climate change, improving public health and lowering household energy bills. This isn’t just bad policy – it’s a direct assault on public health, consumer choice, and environmental progress.

We cannot afford to let this happen.

What is Energy Star?

The roots of Energy Star go back to the early 1990s with the EPA’s Green Lights Program. The idea was forward-thinking for the time: encourage organizations such as businesses, governments and schools to voluntarily upgrade their lighting systems to more energy-efficient options. Participants were asked to install efficient lighting in at least 90% of their spaces over five years—but only if it made financial sense and didn’t compromise lighting quality.

This initiative laid the groundwork for something bigger. In 1992, the program evolved into what we now know as Energy Star and has since grown to cover more than 60 product categories, becoming the gold standard for energy-saving products and practices. Supported by businesses, utility companies and millions of households, Energy Star and the now-iconic blue label is a key pillar of U.S. energy policy.

The Benefits: Real Savings, Cleaner Air and a Healthier Climate

Energy Star isn’t just a label—it’s a powerful tool for saving money, cutting pollution and protecting public health. Since its launch, the program has helped American families and businesses save over $500 billion on energy bills, thanks to products that use less energy than standard models. These savings are especially meaningful for low- and moderate-income households, who often spend a higher portion of their income on utilities. But the benefits don’t stop at cost savings.

By reducing energy consumption, Energy Star also slashes greenhouse gas emissions—preventing more than 400 million metric tons of carbon pollution in 2022 alone, which is on par with taking 100 coal-fired power plants offline for a year. These reductions are critical for slowing the pace of climate change and protecting communities from extreme weather and health-harming pollution that’s made worse by warmer temperatures.

At the same time, using less energy means generating less pollution from fossil fuel–based power, resulting in cleaner air and fewer harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. That’s a win for public health, leading to fewer asthma attacks, respiratory illnesses and heart disease—especially in communities located near power plants or busy roads.

A Program We Can Trust – And One We’re About to Lose

Manufacturers, homebuilders, building owners, small businesses and consumers across the country recognize and trust the Energy Star label. The trust isn’t arbitrary – it’s earned through science-backed standards, independent verification, and administration by the Environmental Protection Agency. Over the years, this trust has created a powerful market signal, encouraging manufacturers to compete by designing better, more efficient products.

But now, this trusted program is under threat, so much so that nearly 1,100 companies and organizations last month urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels in the Energy Star program. If Energy Star funding is eliminated, we won’t just lose a familiar label – we’ll lose a national system of accountability that has shaped energy policy not only in the U.S., but globally. Without it, we risk opening the floodgates to cheap, inefficient products that undercut quality and reverse decades of environmental and consumer protection progress.

At a moment when climate impacts are intensifying and the need for smarter energy use has never been more urgent, eliminating energy efficiency programs is a dangerous step backwards. We’re beginning to see the damage regulatory rollbacks can cause, with proposed weakened standards for appliances like dishwashers, furnaces, and tankless water heaters. Eliminating Energy Star would make those losses permanent and erase one of our most effective tools for reducing emissions, lowering utility bills, and safeguarding public health.

However, it’s not too late – we have a choice. If enough of us speak out, we can stop this short-sighted move. Here’s how you can help advocate to protect and fully fund the Energy Star program:

Contact your members of Congress and urge them to protect and fully fund Energy Star

Choose Energy Star-certified products when replacing appliances, renovating, or building new homes

Share this message and help others understand the real-world benefits of energy efficiency

The stakes are simply too high to stay silent. Eliminating Energy Star would be a needless, harmful setback – and one we can prevent. Now it’s up to all of us to ensure it endures.",https://www.lung.org/getmedia/b77db3ea-70fd-417d-8843-c4370b7e764f/energy-star_1200x630_F.jpg?width=1200&height=629&ext=.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 14:12:45.684268

How we did this

Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to find out how Americans’ views of environmental regulations vary by state – including in states with strong economic ties to fossil fuel production, since discussions about these laws often focus on their application in the energy industry.

The most recent data in this analysis is from the 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study (RLS), a survey of 36,908 U.S. adults conducted from July 17, 2023, to March 4, 2024. To recruit people to take the survey, we used a method known as address-based sampling (ABS). This involved mailing invitation letters to randomly sampled addresses from the United States Postal Service’s Computerized Delivery Sequence File. This approach gave nearly all U.S. adults a chance of being selected to participate in the survey. People who received our invitation had the option of completing the survey online, on paper, or by calling a toll-free number and completing the survey by telephone with an interviewer. In total, 25,250 respondents participated online, 10,733 completed the survey on paper, and 925 participated by phone.

The survey is designed to be representative of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as 34 large metro areas. The data is weighted (using benchmarks from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources) to be representative of the adult population of each state (and D.C.) and of the overall U.S. adult population by gender, age, race, ethnicity, education and other categories. The survey’s margin of error for results based on the full sample is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points. The response rate is 20%. For more details, refer to the survey methodology.

Here are the English and Spanish paper questionnaires (and the combined English/Spanish questionnaire for web/phone administration) used in this analysis, along with responses.

Sample sizes and margins of error vary a lot from state to state. Some differences between states may not be statistically meaningful due to sampling variability and other sources of error that are inherent in all survey data. Refer to this table for state-level responses to the survey question and margins of error.

Methodological information about the other Center surveys referenced in this analysis can be found by following the links provided.

For information on how much the extractive industry – which includes coal mining as well as oil and natural gas drilling – impacts states’ gross domestic product, we turned to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The latest data is for 2024.

Nationally, six-in-ten Americans say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, while 38% say they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy, according to a 2023-24 Pew Research Center survey of 36,908 U.S. adults.

As with many climate and energy issues, opinions vary sharply by party. Most Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think these laws are worth the cost (82%), while Republicans and GOP leaners tend to say they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy (59%).

Opinions also vary widely by state.

Views by state

In 29 states and the District of Columbia, majorities of adults say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost. Views are more split in 20 other states, while in Wyoming, a majority of adults say these laws cost too many jobs and hurt the economy.

D.C. and Minnesota have some of the broadest support for tougher environmental regulations: 71% of adults in each place say these are worth the cost. And around two-thirds of adults in Oregon (68%) and Washington (67%) see these laws as worthwhile.

About six-in-ten in Florida and Pennsylvania (61% each) say the same, while majority support in Missouri sits at the lower end of the spectrum (56%).

Opinions in many other states are more divided – especially in those that tend to lean Republican overall. For example, in Alabama, 52% see stricter environmental laws as worth the cost, while 45% say they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy. In Mississippi, 50% see these regulations as worthwhile and 46% do not. Still, differences across most states persist even after controlling for party.

Views in states with more fossil fuel-reliant economies

Since environmental laws related to the energy industry are highly debated, we also looked at attitudes about environmental regulations in states whose economies rely the most on fossil fuel production.

The extractive industry – which includes coal mining as well as oil and natural gas drilling – makes up 5% or more of the state gross domestic product (GDP) in seven states, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. These states are North Dakota (extractives account for 16% of GDP), West Virginia (15%), Wyoming (14%), Alaska (13%), New Mexico (10%), Oklahoma (8%) and Texas (7%).

Residents of states where the extractive industry makes up a larger share of their state GDP are generally less likely to say that stricter environmental laws are worth the cost than are adults in states with economies that don’t rely as heavily on fossil fuel production.

For example, 48% of North Dakotans and 39% of Wyomingites see these laws as worth the cost. This compares with about seven-in-ten in Vermont (70%) and New Jersey (68%) – which both derive less than 1% of their GDP from the extractive industry.

Americans’ views on federal environmental protection efforts

In addition to their generally favorable views of stricter environmental laws and regulations, Americans see room for improvement in certain areas of environmental protection.

Roughly six-in-ten Americans say the federal government is doing too little to protect the quality of lakes, rivers and streams (63%) and air quality (58%), according to a summer 2023 Center survey.

Majorities also think the federal government should do more to reduce the effects of global climate change (56%) and protect animals and their habitats (55%). Still, 20% say the government is doing too much to curb global climate change.

Americans are split on the potential economic impact of climate policies, according to an October 2024 Center survey. They are just as likely to say policies aimed at reducing the effects of global climate change usually help the economy as they are to say these policies usually hurt it (34% each). Another 30% say these policies make no difference for the U.S. economy.

DALLAS, TEXAS (May 19, 2025) – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that four recipients in Texas will receive $2.5 million in Brownfields grants to assess, cleanup, and revitalize local properties. These grants put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

“The Brownfields program exemplifies Administrator Lee Zeldin’s goal of Powering the Great American Comeback while cleaning up contamination and supporting local economies,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “During the Trump Administration’s first 100 Days, we listed 27 Brownfield sites as Ready for Anticipated Reuse which allows businesses to invest in properties without the fear of potential contamination from hazardous chemicals. With these grants, we will see even more properties transform into thriving economic centers while providing a safe environment for all Americans.”

Grant recipients in Texas include:

The Ark-Tex Council of Governments in Northeast Texas and Southwest Arkansas will receive a $1 million Revolving Loan Fund grant to provide loans and subgrants to support cleanup activities and conduct community engagement. These activities will focus on Miller County, Arkansas, and the cities of Atlanta, Paris, Sulphur Springs and New Boston, Texas.

The city of Austin will receive $500,000 to conduct environmental site assessments around East Austin. Funds will also be used to prepare two reuse plans and conduct engagement activities.

The city of Garland will receive $500,000 to conduct environmental site assessments around downtown, the East Side Corridor, and South Shiloh Industrial Corridor. The funds will also be used to create an evaluation ranking tool and update the brownfield site inventory, prepare five cleanup plans, and conduct engagement activities.

The city of Texarkana will receive $500,000 to conduct environmental site assessments in the State Line Culture Corridor area, including the Union Station site—a former railyard—and the abandoned Regency Building. Grant funds also will be used to create a brownfield site inventory and rank sites based on community input, prepare seven cleanup plans, support two visioning sessions, and conduct community engagement activities.

Federal grant recipients must satisfy legal and administrative requirements to receive funds from EPA. Brownfield Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup Grants includes:

$121.8 million for 148 selectees for Assessment Grants, which will provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments, and community outreach.

DALLAS, TEXAS (May 19, 2025) – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that five recipients in Louisiana will receive a total of $6,891,144 in Brownfields grants to assess, cleanup, and revitalize local properties. These grants put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

“The Brownfields program exemplifies Administrator Lee Zeldin’s goal of Powering the Great American Comeback while cleaning up contamination and supporting local economies,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “During the Trump Administration’s first 100 Days, we listed 27 Brownfield sites as Ready for Anticipated Reuse which allows businesses to invest in properties without the fear of potential contamination from hazardous chemicals. With these grants, we will see even more properties transform into thriving economic centers while providing a safe environment for all Americans.”

“We are grateful to the EPA and the Region 6 Brownfields Team for their partnership and support in preparing this site for safe, sustainable reuse,” said Kathy Laborde, Gulf Coast Housing Partnership President and CEO. “This funding is a critical step forward in transforming a fallow property into a community asset.”

Grant recipients in Louisiana include:

The Acadiana Planning Commission will receive a $1.2 million Brownfields Assessment Coalition Grant to develop five cleanup plans, two Brownfield Revitalization Plans, two Market Studies, and one site reuse vision, and to support community engagement activities. Assessment activities will focus on the City of Ville Platte, the Downtown Main Street neighborhood of the City of Opelousas, the City of Abbeville’s Economic Opportunity Zone, and the City of Eunice’s St. Landry Corridor. Priority sites include the Old Abdalla’s Department Store that has been vacant for 35 years in Opelousas, the 13-acre Riviana Rice Mill in Abbeville, and the 0.5-acre historic Hotel Mayer in St. Landry.

The DeSoto Parish Police Jury will receive a $1.2 million Brownfields Assessment Coalition Grant to develop six cleanup plans, three visioning sessions, three Site Reuse Assessments, one Community Health Assessment, one Site Reuse Vision, and one Brownfield Revitalization Plan; create a brownfields inventory and an evaluation ranking tool to rank sites; and support community engagement activities. Assessment activities in the DeSoto Parish will focus on Grand Cane, the City of Mansfield, and the Village of South Mansfield. Priority sites include a 40-acre former Military Auxiliary Landing Strip, the 127,000-square-foot former DeSoto Plaza Shopping Center, and the former Oak Hill Commissary.

The Gulf Coast Housing Partnership, Inc. will receive a $3,491,144 Brownfields Cleanup Grant to clean up the former Benjamin Banneker Elementary School located at 701 S. Upland Avenue in the City of River Ridge. The site was home to an elementary school from 1967 to 1982. The building was later used as a police substation and training academy and has been unused since 2008. All structures on the site were demolished in 2022. The site is contaminated with chloroform and naphthalene in soil vapor. Grant funds also will be used to support community engagement activities.

The Lafourche Parish will receive a $500,000 Brownfields Assessment Grant to develop three cleanup plans and support reuse planning and community engagement activities. The target area for this grant includes the unincorporated community of Raceland and the Town of Lockport. Priority sites include two former fuel stations of 0.45 and 0.25 acres, respectively, and a 0.25-acre vacant and used boat and automobile maintenance facility.

The City of Leesville will receive a $500,000 Brownfields Assessment Grant to develop four cleanup plans and support reuse planning and community engagement activities. The target area for this grant is the city’s Nolan Trace Corridor. Priority sites include the 9-acre Old State School and the 2,300-square-foot former 911 Call Center.

Federal grant recipients must satisfy legal and administrative requirements to receive funds from EPA. Brownfield Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup Grants includes:

$121.8 million for 148 selectees for Assessment Grants, which will provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments, and community outreach.

$88.2 million for 51 selectees for Cleanup Grants, which will provide funding to carry out cleanup activities at brownfield sites owned by the recipient.

WHRO: You focused a lot on environmental justice, including a task force that was just getting off the ground in Norfolk.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is facing steep reductions to staff and funding while President Donald Trump’s administration redirects the agency’s focus to workforce efficiency and deregulating energy industries.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced earlier this month a significant restructuring of the agency, including cutting staff to Reagan-era levels to save about $300 million in the next fiscal year.

“With these organizational improvements, we recommit to fulfilling all of our statutory obligations and exceptionally delivering on EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” Zeldin said in a news release. “This reorganization will bring much needed efficiencies to incorporate science into our rulemakings and sharply focus our work on providing the cleanest air, land, and water for our communities.”

Cuts have reached Region 3, which oversees a host of environmental work in Virginia, according to Adam Ortiz, who served as EPA’s administrator of the Mid-Atlantic office under the Biden administration.

Ortiz, who now works for Maryland’s Department of the Environment, recently spoke with WHRO and said he’s concerned about potential impacts of ongoing cuts to public health and the massive effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

WHRO: Tell me about your former role with the EPA and what you did there.

Adam Ortiz: I'm the former regional administrator for the Mid-Atlantic region at EPA, including Virginia, and oversaw the execution of federal laws and grants and cleanup projects.

Environmental challenges are all around us, and what we face in this country is not just dealing with stuff in the present moment, but we're also cleaning up 100 years worth of pollution, especially in industrial and naval areas like Hampton Roads and the Norfolk area, and also trying to prepare for the future by having clean energy and reduce the impacts of climate change. So that's a big agenda. In recent years, we did a lot of catching up in those areas. (There’s) still a staggering amount of work to do. But the recent actions by the Trump administration have hobbled or hindered or prevented that progress from moving forward. And places that are low lying, older cities that have more environmental liabilities, are the most at risk.

WHRO: What do you see or hear currently happening at the Mid-Atlantic office that concerns you?

AO: We really accelerated our cleanups of Superfund and Brownfield sites. In coastal Virginia, there's hundreds and hundreds of them, and we made a lot of progress but there’s still a lot to do, because they're very expensive and very complicated. Many of those projects have been placed on hold and also a lot of the staff have been prevented from engaging with the public in the way that we used to.

Basic questions about public health are being hampered. Recent actions have laid off the staff that were working on those projects. And then further cuts are being made into the funding of those projects themselves.

Often that funding is passed on from the EPA to local communities like Portsmouth (and) Norfolk, to do the cleanups themselves. That is coming to a standstill as well.

WHRO: Are there some specific projects in Hampton Roads that you’re worried about?

AO: Because of the military history and the naval history, there's a lot of chemicals, a lot of unexploded ordnance, a lot of health hazards that are beneath the surface of the land that get into people's bodies, either through the land, through air or through water. So we stepped up our cleanups of many Brownfield sites and Superfund sites, including Peck Iron and Metal (in Portsmouth). That's a facility that's been shut down for more than 20 years. What's been found on that site in particular, which is characteristic of other sites in the region, are PCBs, battery acid, arsenic, lead and even radioactive material that the public needs to hear about and get educated. But the health experts have been gagged. Many of them have been fired or laid off.

And like all coastal places, sea level rise is a real thing. It’s a big deal. Flooding is becoming more and more common, and critical infrastructure is all along the shoreline of Virginia's coast. Preventing the sources of climate change, as well as dealing with flooding when it happens, have also been under attack.

These are really big impacts that we're beginning to feel. But as time goes on and there's not experts, staff or the funding to fix problems, it's going to become more and more of a problem for everyday people.

WHRO: You focused a lot on environmental justice, including a task force that was just getting off the ground in Norfolk. What’s happening with that now?

AO: Well, environmental justice was a priority because it needs to be. It’s central to the mission of EPA to protect public health and the environment. And some of these communities, especially around Portsmouth, Norfolk area, communities that are overwhelmed with pollution, where health outcomes are very poor, some of the worst in the country, we spent a lot of time and provided a lot of technical assistance to communities to help reduce risks. To help clean things up and get grant money into local governments and non-governmental organizations to do cleanups and solve those problems.

That was called the engagement communities initiative. The whole premise was that we have to engage and work closely because there's an awful lot of pollution, a complex series of sources that have real impacts on the health of people and especially our youngest and our oldest. There was a team of experts that were going in. But unfortunately — on Earth Day — 20 people in the Mid-Atlantic office received their pink slips. They received a notice saying that their work was not consistent with the mission of the agency. And furthermore, the staff have been prevented from even using the term environmental justice. So places that are most at risk are going to suffer even more.

WHRO: One big issue for the Mid-Atlantic is the Chesapeake Bay restoration. What did you learn about that effort during your time at Region 3, and how could it be impacted by all this?

AO: For many years, there was uneven support of the Chesapeake Bay effort. It consists of many states all the way up to New York, as well as the federal government, working with farmers and with private industry, and it'd been uneven. Four years ago, there was a lawsuit against EPA that it wasn't doing enough and in the Biden administration, we settled that lawsuit. We brought everybody together, regardless of political party, and stepped up our efforts. We stepped up our enforcement, we stepped up our funding, we stepped up the application of science.

After a few short years, we saw the results in 2023: the Chesapeake Bay received its highest health grade in more than 22 years, and that's because we were working together. But that requires a strong federal government in that captain's chair. And what we see in this administration is that they cut the program. They undermined it. They said it wasn't important. They weren't enforcing or holding the states accountable. A shared resource like the Chesapeake Bay, which spans so many states and has thousands of streams feeding into it, requires an all hands on deck approach. I think it's going to be tough for us to maintain the recent successes that we've had with an ambivalent or a disinterested federal government.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c580776/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2F50%2F39542ddb435a83d8f613d21bbf25%2Fimg-3463.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 13:13:34.697986

Site history The Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. Superfund site has been on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1984.
Site owner 1500 S Tibbs LLC is a subsidiary of Indianapolis-based chemical manufacturing company Aurorium.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finalized a plan to clean up a cancer-causing chemical found in groundwater at the Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. Superfund site on the west side of Indianapolis.

Groundwater monitors detected benzene underground along South Tibbs Avenue near the 120-acre site at 1500 S. Tibbs Ave. The EPA said its plan seeks to clean up the chemical there within the next two decades.

EPA remedial project manager Dion Novak approved plans for contractors hired by site owner 1500 S Tibbs LLC to install 73 wells to inject compressed air underground to grow bacteria that will eat up the benzene. The process, called air sparging, is expected to clean up the benzene in eight to nearly 20 years.

The plan also calls for the installation of 43 new groundwater monitoring points and 24 soil gas monitoring points at the site and 12 new monitoring wells in properties near the site.

The well and monitor installations are expected to begin in late summer or early fall and will take about three months to complete. Crews will spend the next year ensuring that the wells are operating as planned and will monitor the groundwater until the contamination is cleaned up.

Novak said monitoring wells will help detect whether benzene trapped in the groundwater leaks into homes, a process known as vapor intrusion. If the chemical is detected, the agency may install a mitigation system or other method to address the vapor intrusion.

Site history

The Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. Superfund site has been on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1984. Site owner 1500 S Tibbs LLC is a subsidiary of Indianapolis-based chemical manufacturing company Aurorium.

The site was used until 1972 to treat telephone poles with creosote, a substance that helps preserve and protect the wood but also is considered a likely contributor to cancer. Chemicals were manufactured at a plant there from the mid-1940s until the plant closed last April.

New York State Senator Joe Griffo image.","ALBANY, NY- While both chambers of the legislature were still negotiating a state budget deal late last month, one North Country lawmaker convened a meeting in Albany between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and business owners, local officials, statewide association representatives and others who have been or may be negatively affected by New York's Advanced Clean Truck (ACT) Rule.

“I appreciate the willingness of EPA Regional Administrator Martucci and his staff to meet with some of those affected by the ACT Rule,” Sen. Griffo said.

“This meeting was an important opportunity for area business owners, trucking associations and local officials to discuss concerns with this problematic regulation directly with the EPA. While I understand the need to embrace clean energy, the CLCPA has resulted in unfordable mandates, including this electric truck regulation, that will have major impacts on numerous communities, businesses and industries in New York. I will continue to advocate reasonable and realistic deadlines and expectations to reach the state’s energy goals.”

Be sure to listen to our latest on-air segment with the Senator for more of his insight:

The meeting was part of Griffo’s ongoing efforts to help truck dealerships, individual truck owners, commercial trucking companies, municipal highway departments and local governments deal with this regulation, which has received loyal support Democratic leaders, according to a statement from his office.

To clarify, Senator Griffo has stated numerous times in the past that he is certainly not opposed to cleaner energy goals, but rather he questions some of the approaches to zero emission energy and whether or not these goals are feasible.

In late 2021, Griffo says the governor announced that the ACT Rule had been adopted as part of the state’s efforts to meet the targets of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which he did not support.

The regulation would require that medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including municipal plows, be manufactured as zero emission starting in 2025, with the goal of 100% of trucks over 8,500 pounds to be zero emission by 2045.

However, groups like the New York State Automobile Dealers Association, Trucking Association of New York, New York State County Highway Association and local highway superintendents and departments and Utica Mack, Inc. have pushed back against this regulation because it would be detrimental to businesses and communities.

They have urged that the state slow down implementation because of a lack of needed equipment and that the required infrastructure is not yet ready for this significant shift to zero emission vehicles.

Sen. Griffo has introduced legislation (S.1749) that would delay the implementation of the ACT regulation to provide more time to fully understand the effect that this rule would have on industries and municipalities in the state.

Assemblywoman Buttenschon has sponsored a companion bill (A.1073) in the Assembly.

Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.
While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General.
Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters.
Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects.","In Washington, D.C., House Republicans plan to gather Tuesday to vote on whether to shred the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark law that has issued hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives since 2022, as part of President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal.

Meanwhile, in Vermont on Tuesday morning, a state program funded by that very law announced more than $22 million of the state’s total grant of $62.5 million would go to help install solar power on low-income housing in the state.

“Currently towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner for the Department of Public Service, which controls the state’s grant, said in a statement. “That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”

The funding is part of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion national initiative to lower the cost of electricity by installing solar on buildings and developing solar arrays in communities. Across the country, the program could pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.

Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But funding for the solar program has been under threat before by the Trump administration, and it could be under threat again as the Republican-dominated Congress moves to axe programs from the IRA to achieve the multi-trillion-dollar budget President Trump is calling “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”

On Sunday, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee proposed to meet the budget goals by repealing grants from a $27 billion IRA program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aims to lower carbon emissions. One of the three programs in that fund is the Solar for All program.

“Donald Trump campaigned on lowering electric bills for working Americans. As president, he’s doing exactly the opposite,” Sanders said in an email Tuesday. “The disastrous reconciliation bill being pushed by Trump and Congressional Republicans would not only make electric bills more expensive for Vermonters, it would make the climate crisis worse.”

Sanders said the good news was that the budget bill couldn’t legally rescind Vermont’s $62.5 million grant that was allocated to the Vermont Department of Public Service.

“The bad news is that Trump does not respect the Constitution or rule of law,” Sanders said. “I will continue to do everything I can to make sure Solar for All funding is deployed to lower electric bills, slash carbon emissions, and create thousands of good jobs.”

The road to how the federal government got to this massive repeal process began in January, when Trump took office and issued a flurry of executive orders. Those included Unleashing American Energy, which called for a 90-day freeze on IRA funds. A letter sent a week later by the EPA notified Solar for All recipients that the hundred of millions of dollars they’d received so far was paused until further notice. Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.

“While the federal funding landscape is dynamic, we have a binding agreement with EPA and the funding is obligated,” said Randy Brittingham, grant program manager at the state energy office for the Vermont Department of Public Service, in an email. After a pause in communication and access to funds this winter, Brittingham said the state is back in regular contact with the EPA. “We’ve successfully drawn funding for this program since that February pause,” he said.

But Lee Zeldin, the new EPA administrator, has gone further since February, claiming in March that President Joe Biden’s administration had doled out billions of dollars that were vulnerable to “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Zeldin tried to claw back $20 billion from the two other programs in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and while caught up in court battles, those funds largely remain frozen. While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General. The audit is ongoing, according to Kim Wheeler, director of strategic communications for that office.

“Solar for All was selected because it is a $7 billion program with a financing structure that is new and different for the EPA, with $25 million already spent,” Wheeler said in an email on Tuesday. She did not respond by the time of publication to a question about whether the EPA considers only $25 million of the program obligated.

While Wheeler said her office doesn’t have the authority to make or revoke funding decisions, if her office found an issue with an award during an investigation, it could make recommendations to the EPA.

“If we identified an issue during an audit (such as the project you are asking about), we could recommend that the Agency evaluate whether to suspend payment or terminate the award,” Wheeler said of the Solar for All program.

Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters. More than a third of the $62.5 million grant was awarded this week to the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing, to make solar more accessible for low-income households.

These funds – called Multi Family Affordable Housing – will be awarded to new developers for affordable housing projects like multi-family apartment buildings, largely benefitting renters. Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects.

“We know that renters have been very underserved by solar resources in the past, so it’s exciting for us as a housing funder to help developers successfully electrify their buildings and rely less on fossil fuels,” said Mia Watson, special programs manager for the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, who is supporting the Solar for All award.

Tenants who have an electric bill could see at least 20% in bill savings and tenants without an electric bill would receive an equivalent benefit, Brittingham said. He added that all residents would benefit from the climate impacts of growing Vermont’s solar generation.

Residents and developers can attend public outreach sessions hosted by the finance agency in the coming months. The finance agency in partnership with the state will submit a work plan for EPA approval by December. They expect to award funds to developers early next year.

“We’re still cautious about what may happen at the federal level, but so far the indications we have are good that this program is going to happen,” Watson said. “We’ve had strong support from the state and our congressional delegation, especially Sen. Sanders, but I think everyone involved is a little concerned that things could change unexpectedly.”

The decision by global automotive giant Stellantis to close its Luton van factory, with the loss of over 1000 workers’ jobs, has laid bare the grave situation facing workers in the UK’s automotive industry. A storm of corporate profiteering, automation, and the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs), has meant the threat of factory closures and job losses, for both workers producing vehicles and workers across the UK’s automotive supply chain.

Yet the corporate-led automotive transition is also driving injustices for workers and mine affected communities across the supply chain globally. The production of EVs requires lithium-ion batteries, which are produced in gigafactories – large, high volume battery manufacturing facilities. The UK Government states that to provide the battery capacity needed to maintain existing levels of automotive production, but shift entirely to EVs, the UK would need 200 GWh of battery manufacturing capacity by 2040, approximately 10 gigafactories.

Lithium-ion batteries require huge quantities of minerals including lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper. According to the latest statistics none of these minerals are mined in the UK, meaning despite some plans for domestic mining UK manufacturers are overwhelmingly dependent on imports from other countries. 10 lithium-ion battery gigafactories would vastly increase the UK’s demand for these minerals, and mean the UK would be consuming a disproportionate and inequitable share of the world’s resources. This would lead to severe impacts for mine affected communities and workers globally.

The UK would, by 2040, every year require nearly a fifth of the world’s mined lithium, 6% of the world’s nickel, and 15% of the world’s cobalt.

The huge expansions of mining that would be needed to meet skyrocketing UK mineral demands would be felt overwhelmingly by workers and communities in the Global South. Many of the world’s biggest mining companies are British, listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in London, and are at the heart of driving these injustices.

A just, worker-led transition

There is another way to deliver the decarbonisation of the transport sector that is so urgently needed. By investing rapidly in scaling up public transport and active forms of travel, the UK can create a diversified transportation system which reduces reliance on private vehicles. While electrified public transport still requires batteries and minerals, public transport EVs are much more efficient and require far lower quantities of minerals per rider.

By investing in battery recycling, and car remanufacturing infrastructure, the UK can also reduce the need for new mining to create lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles, moving towards a circular economy model. Not only would this reduce the need for new mining, but it would create thousands of manufacturing jobs.

Research from the United States shows that, by investing in public transport, reducing the size of vehicles that are produced, and scaling up battery recycling infrastructure, potential increases in lithium demand can be reduced by 92%. Similar reductions could be expected in the UK. The research also demonstrates that a diversified transport system, with less private vehicles but an expansion of mobility options – including public transport and safe streets – would produce a net increase of 2.4 million jobs.

A transition in the interests of people not profit can only come from, and be designed by, workers themselves. Worker-led transition plans outline how production could be transitioned, and the training and reskilling necessary for workers to ensure they are able to maintain jobs on equal terms and conditions. From grassroots automotive workers in the UAW trade union in the United States organising for supply chain justice, to GKN workers in Italy who fought for plans to transition from producing luxury cars to solar panels and cargo bikes, we know this is possible.

As workers in the UK resist corporate attacks and job losses, it is crucial that the climate movement stands with them in solidarity. We cannot accept the loss of secure, decently paid jobs under the guise of decarbonisation. At the same time, it is crucial that trade unions in the UK and across the Global North build solidarity with workers and communities on the frontlines of resistance to the expansion of mining for battery minerals globally. Transition plans must minimise mineral demands, through prioritising public transit over EV production and scaling up recycling infrastructure, and deliver supply chain justice.

Read more about the EPA PFAS rollback.","The EPA rescinded and is reconsidering the regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA, four of the six PFAS types previously limited by regulations.

In April 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as ‘forever chemicals.’ Exposure to PFAS has been linked to deadly cancers, impacts to the liver and heart, and immune and developmental damage to infants and children.

Last week, the EPA announced that some of those regulations, specifically those that limited levels of PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA, would be rescinded and reconsidered. Regulations limiting PFOA and PFOS will still remain in place. Additionally, EPA plans to develop a rulemaking to provide additional time for compliance, including a proposal to extend the compliance date to 2031.

PFAS OUT

To enhance engagement on addressing PFAS, EPA will launch PFAS OUT to connect with every public water utility known to need capital improvements to address PFAS in their systems, including those EPA has identified as having PFOA and PFOS levels above EPA’s MCL. EPA will share resources, tools, funding, and technical assistance to help utilities meet the federal drinking water standards. PFAS OUT will ensure that no community is left behind as we work to protect public health and bring utilities into compliance with federal drinking water standards. PFAS OUT will engage utilities, technical assistance providers and local, State, Tribal, and Territorial leaders to develop effective, practical solutions where they are needed most.

EPA will continue to offer free water technical assistance (WaterTA) that provides services to water systems to improve their drinking water and help communities access available funding. EPA’s WaterTA initiatives work with water systems nationwide to identify affordable solutions to assess and address PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS. Services offered to utilities include water quality testing, development of technical plans, operator training support, designing public engagement and outreach strategies, and support for accessing federal funding opportunities.

What This Means in Maryland

While the federal government may be easing its initial push to remove PFAS from drinking water, the General Assembly and the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) have shown active interest in responding more aggressively to this growing issue. SB732/HB909 garnered significant attention as it aimed to limit PFAS concentrations in sewage sludge, and while the legislation did not pass, there are already conversations about an even more ambitious package of PFAS bills for the 2026 legislative session. For its part, MDE is also exploring what regulatory tools it has at its disposal to limit PFAS in areas under its jurisdiction.

At least 19 people were killed in Kentucky and five more in St. Louis after a powerful tornado tore through homes and tossed vehicles like toys. Thousands of homes were damaged, with officials warning the death toll may rise.

Survivors in places like London, Kentucky, are racing to salvage belongings before the next storm hits. Governor Andy Beshear said survey teams are preparing disaster aid applications as many roads remain closed.

With more tornadoes expected in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, plus triple-digit heat in the South and snow in the Rockies, the central U.S. is facing a week of extreme, conflicting weather threats.

Key quote:

“It was dark and still raining but every lightning flash, it was lighting up your nightmares: Everything was gone.”

— Zach Wilson, Kentucky resident

Why this matters:

As the climate crisis intensifies storm patterns, protecting public health and infrastructure — especially in rural and southern regions — becomes increasingly urgent. Yet federal support for forecasting is eroding: The Trump administration has made massive cuts to National Weather Service offices. Another AP story reported that the Jackson, Kentucky, weather office, which was responsible for the hard-hit area around London, Kentucky, had a March 2025 vacancy rate of 25%. Meanwhile, the Louisville, Kentucky, weather service staff was down 29%, and the St. Louis office was down 16%. The staff reductions raise serious concerns about the agency's ability to provide timely forecasting and emergency alerts in advance of life-threatening storms.

In short:

Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson told staff the agency will prioritize state-led disaster response, with the federal government stepping in “when deemed necessary.”

President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have signaled interest in scaling back or eliminating FEMA entirely, with Richardson ordered to align the agency with this vision.

States like Texas and Florida are seen as ready to handle more disaster responsibilities, while others may lose the typical 75% federal cost-share for recovery, forcing them to rely more heavily on state funds.

Key quote:

“It’s unclear what they mean when they say returning primacy to the states. What does that mean when certain states don’t have the resources in their own budgets to respond to and recover from catastrophic events?”

— Jeremy Edwards, FEMA deputy director of public affairs during the Biden administration

Why this matters:

As climate-fueled disasters increase in size and frequency, FEMA’s decision to reduce its role could leave many states unprepared and underfunded during emergencies. In 2024, the U.S. saw 90 major disaster declarations and 27 billion-dollar climate disasters. If states must now finance more of their disaster recovery alone, disparities in outcomes may widen. Critics argue this shift could result in a patchwork of responses across the country, with some regions better protected than others. With hurricane season just weeks away, the consequences of this policy change could become evident very soon.

In short:

A new analysis by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (Ceba) found that repealing clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act would raise household utility bills and lower incomes, with at least 19 states affected.

The proposed rollback, introduced by House Republicans, targets credits 48E and 45Y, which support clean energy investments and production; the plan would phase them out after 2031 and impose new restrictions in the meantime.

In New Jersey alone, the repeal could cause utility bills to rise by over 13%, eliminate more than 22,000 jobs, and reduce the state GDP by $3.24 billion.

Key quote:

“Now is the time for Congress to incentivize private investment in more sources of low-cost, reliable energy that fuels economic growth and jobs, helps the United States secure energy dominance and independence, and decreases energy costs nationwide.”

— Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association

Why this matters:

The stakes are high: Without continued federal support for clean energy, states may be forced to lean more heavily on older, dirtier power sources, putting climate goals further out of reach and increasing air pollution, which harms both human health and the environment. The research suggests that even conservative-leaning states would feel the pinch, challenging the partisan framing of climate investments and shifting the debate toward the tangible pocketbook effects of energy policy decisions.

In short:

Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.) represents a swing district transformed by clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, including a rapidly growing Lucid Motors plant and a major solar expansion.

Ciscomani has urged party leaders to preserve key tax credits but voted for a budget resolution enabling their potential repeal, as GOP leaders move to eliminate most clean energy incentives to fund a sweeping megabill.

His political future hangs in the balance as Democrats mobilize to hold him accountable, while local officials warn that ending the credits would stall economic growth and job creation.

Key quote:

“As much as there are other aspects of the IRA we [Republicans] can disagree with, these tax credits have had an impact in my district — and on job creation, on investment, also national security, because of energy production and having wanted to bring that more domestically.”

— Juan Ciscomani, U.S. representative from Arizona

Why this matters:

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, has funneled billions into clean energy development, especially in economically struggling areas. In Arizona’s 6th District, those investments are reshaping the region. Across rural areas, solar projects are helping control rising utility costs and stabilizing grids amid extreme heat. Many of these projects hinge on tax credits the House GOP now aims to repeal, threatening jobs, local tax bases, and energy resilience. Constituents, many of them veterans or working-class residents, risk losing new opportunities if clean energy incentives vanish. While some Republican lawmakers recognize the benefits and seek a middle ground, party pressure to dismantle the IRA — branded a “Green New Scam” by Trump — puts them in a bind.

In short:

Four draft executive orders under review by the Trump administration would shift nuclear safety oversight from the NRC to the Department of Energy, placing final authority over advanced reactors under the president.

The proposed overhaul would subject NRC rules to case-by-case review by the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, potentially slowing licensing decisions and undermining regulatory transparency.

Critics from across the political spectrum argue the move could compromise safety, delay reactor deployment, and violate legal frameworks like the Atomic Energy Act and the Sunshine Act.

Key quote:

“NRC’s reputation as a trusted regulator is important to the public, to industry, and to potential customers of U.S. nuclear technology both here and abroad. We don’t want changing political winds in either direction to undermine NRC’s credibility.”

— Judi Greenwald, executive director of the Nuclear Innovation Alliance

Why this matters:

Nuclear energy provides roughly one-fifth of U.S. electricity and serves as a key player in decarbonization strategies. But the technology’s inherent risks demand vigilant, science-based oversight. Weakening the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s independence could politicize safety decisions and sideline technical expertise, increasing the chance of errors with lasting environmental and health consequences. Low-level radiation exposure, for instance, has been linked to cardiovascular damage and other long-term effects — risks that may not fully emerge until years after exposure. At a time when public trust in science and government is already strained, any move that makes safety oversight appear less impartial could erode confidence in the country’s energy infrastructure.

In short:

Chubb, a major global insurer, is no longer providing property insurance to Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal, a move revealed through public records and confirmed by the company, though the specific reason remains unclear.

Residents of Cameron Parish, Louisiana, have long opposed the facility, citing thousands of permit violations and a growing body of evidence linking pollution from LNG operations to serious health risks including asthma and cancer.

Chubb’s decision follows years of activist pressure and coincides with broader shifts in the insurance industry, which is beginning to distance itself from high-emissions fossil fuel projects amid worsening climate-related disasters.

Key quote:

“We have been pressuring Chubb for several years now to not insure these dangerous, polluting projects, because insuring those projects is ensuring environmental racism in communities that are overburdened by pollution.”

— Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project of Louisiana

Why this matters:

Liquefied natural gas, often marketed as a “cleaner” fossil fuel, emits significant amounts of methane — a potent greenhouse gas — throughout its production and export cycle. Along Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, a rapid buildout of LNG terminals is transforming low-income communities, many of them majority Black, into industrial hubs. These areas already suffer from some of the nation’s worst toxic emissions and are highly vulnerable to climate disasters like hurricanes and floods, which are intensifying with rising global temperatures. Insurance companies, facing ballooning costs from extreme weather, are increasingly exiting high-risk regions while continuing to support the very projects contributing to those risks.

In short:

More than 56,000 people across 50+ First Nations depend on winter ice roads, but warming temperatures have shortened the window for travel and transport, forcing expensive alternatives like air freight.

As communities push for permanent all-season roads, government funding often comes with an implicit expectation of mining approvals, raising tensions over Indigenous sovereignty and environmental protections.

Some First Nations, like Cat Lake, are trying to build permanent roads without backing mining projects, but face steep costs and limited support from provincial and federal authorities.

Key quote:

“We said no to the mine, and we said yes to the road.”

— Rachel Wesley, economic development officer, Cat Lake First Nation

Why this matters:

For remote First Nations, these seasonal roads are more than infrastructure — they are lifelines, enabling access to medicine, fuel, food, and connection to the outside world. Their disappearance means communities face higher living costs, deeper isolation, and harder choices. Many now face pressure to approve mining projects in exchange for permanent roads, risking their lands, water, and cultural survival. The minerals in these regions — vital to the green energy transition — lie beneath wetlands that store immense amounts of carbon. Mining them would release greenhouse gases on a scale comparable to the Amazon. As governments and corporations angle to tap this potential, Indigenous peoples must navigate coercive funding dynamics and colonial legacies.

Fast-Tracked Permitting for Critical Energy Projects Following the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, the BLM announced plans to expedite permitting for key projects.","The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has announced a series of major policy shifts that will impact the future of energy development on public lands, including the rescission of key renewable energy incentives, streamlined oil and gas leasing, and expedited permitting for critical projects. These decisions reflect a renewed emphasis on energy independence and economic growth, but they have also sparked sharp debate among industry leaders, environmental advocates, and policymakers.

From the rollback of intermittent energy regulations to accelerated approvals for fossil fuel projects, the agency’s latest actions signal a transformational shift in federal land management. While supporters see these changes as essential to reducing regulatory roadblocks and boosting U.S. energy production, critics warn that they could slow clean energy progress and weaken environmental protections.

Rescission of Intermittent Energy Rule

On May 14, 2025, the Department of the Interior announced its intent to rescind the Bureau of Land Management’s intermittent energy rule, which governed solar and wind energy development on public lands. Originally implemented under the Biden administration, the rule lowered rental rates and capacity fees for renewable energy projects, incentivizing solar and wind expansion.

Interior officials argue that the rollback will restore balance by eliminating preferential treatment for intermittent energy sources and unlock America’s full energy potential. Proponents within the fossil fuel industry see this as an opportunity to level the playing field, ensuring that all energy sectors are regulated under the same framework. However, environmental groups strongly oppose the measure, arguing that the rescission disincentivizes renewable energy development and may slow the transition toward clean energy. Some organizations are considering legal challenges to prevent the policy change from taking effect.

Streamlining Oil and Gas Leasing Process

On May 13, 2025, the BLM announced major reforms to oil and gas leasing, pledging to complete lease parcel reviews within six months, nearly cutting previous review times in half. The agency aims to increase the availability of federal lands for leasing, reduce bureaucratic delays, and enhance public engagement.

Energy industry leaders and economic analysts have welcomed the move, noting that simplified regulations could boost domestic energy production, create jobs, and strengthen U.S. energy independence. They argue that accelerating lease approvals will help meet growing energy demands while ensuring continued investment in U.S. resources.

However, environmental groups and some local communities have raised concerns about potential ecological damage from increased fossil fuel leasing. Critics worry that expediting approvals could reduce oversight and lead to long-term environmental consequences such as habitat degradation and water contamination. Some advocacy groups have called for stricter environmental assessments before leases are finalized.

Fast-Tracked Permitting for Critical Energy Projects

Following the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, the BLM announced plans to expedite permitting for key projects. One of the first initiatives to receive accelerated approval is the Velvet-Wood mine in Utah, a site known for its uranium and vanadium production, critical materials for nuclear energy and high-strength steel manufacturing.

The BLM has committed to completing environmental reviews within 14 days, significantly reducing traditional permitting timelines. Federal officials argue that these changes will increase domestic production of essential energy resources, reinforcing national security.

The decision has sparked debate, with supporters emphasizing the strategic importance of uranium production in ensuring energy resilience. Opponents, however, fear that rapid approvals may undermine environmental safety protocols, leading to potential long-term consequences for local ecosystems.

Public Input for 2026 Oil and Gas Lease Sale

On May 12, 2025, the BLM New Mexico State Office opened a 30-day public scoping period to receive input on 20,479 acres of oil and gas parcels that may be included in the January 2026 lease sale in New Mexico and Oklahoma.

BLM officials have encouraged stakeholder participation, allowing communities, businesses, and advocacy groups to weigh in on potential environmental impacts and economic opportunities. Public reactions have been divided—some local business owners see the lease sale as an opportunity for economic growth and job creation, while environmental advocates warn that expanded drilling in sensitive areas could harm ecosystems and water supplies.

Looking Ahead

As the BLM implements these policies, the broader energy landscape continues to evolve. The debate surrounding renewables vs. fossil fuels, regulatory efficiency, and environmental conservation will likely shape further decisions. With stakeholder input, legal challenges, and legislative responses on the horizon, the implications of these moves will extend beyond immediate policy changes.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20241106-152434-899-og-eel.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:16:20.786763

In Q1 2025, the company decreased its net loss on a yearly basis from US$28.7 million to US$16.2 million.
Other than the Saudi agreement, the company initiated several other capital formation initiatives to secure funding for the solar cell plant.
The timeline for the construction of the Austin solar cell plant still remains unchanged, according to the company with a forecast to begin production by Q4 2026.","According to the company, these near-term trade policy uncertainties are “obscuring Bill of Materials cost visibility and creating a temporary lull in bidding activity”.

Moreover, it has also reduced its production forecast from 3.4GW to 2.6-3GW in 2025, despite an annual nameplate production capacity of 5GW once its first factory is fully operational. The company’s guidance reduction also reflects the change of technology from passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) in three production lines with a US$500,000 investment and a potential 800MW inventory build.

The module assembly plant – dubbed G1 Dallas – in Dallas, Texas, which was acquired last year from Chinese solar manufacturer TrinaSolar, continues to ramp up production and sales, of which it recently signed a 253MW supply agreement with an undisclosed US utility-scale developer. This sales agreement brings the company’s total modules sold in 2025 to 1.75GW.

The module assembly plant has produced 690MW, as of 11 May 2025, according to the company, while module shipments to the US arm of German utility RWE began during the second quarter.

Daniel Barcelo, T1’s CEO and chairman of the Board, said: “Although potential changes to trade policy are creating near-term uncertainties in the merchant sales market for T1 and our developer customers, we are well positioned to manage this sales environment with 1.7 GW of 2025 contracted module offtake coverage, a robust cash and liquidity position, and the continued production and sales ramp up at G1 Dallas.”

Regarding last week’s US House Ways and Means Committee’s Reconciliation Bill, T1 said that certain elements of the bill potentially “undermine growth, competition, and job creation in the US solar industry”, while adding that the preservation of 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credits (PTCs) “demonstrates support for US solar manufacturing”.

Revenues generated from the module assembly plant during the first quarter of 2025 were US$64.6 million, with sales exclusively tied to offtake agreements under TrinaSolar. In Q1 2025, the company decreased its net loss on a yearly basis from US$28.7 million to US$16.2 million.

T1 Energy started out as Freyr Battery, a Norway-headquartered startup focused on lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery production, aiming to make products in Europe and the US, before pivoting into the solar PV space, completing its official rebranding under the new name in February.

Potential Saudi investment for solar cell plant

A few months after T1 unveiled the location for the construction of its solar cell plant – dubbed G2 Austin – which will also be located in Texas, more specifically Milam County in Austin, the company entered into a non-bidding agreement with an undisclosed Saudi company – aligned with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – to pursue an investment in T1’s solar cell processing plant.

Other than the Saudi agreement, the company initiated several other capital formation initiatives to secure funding for the solar cell plant.

“[T1] is currently advancing a project financing with its consortium of commercial lenders, the monetisation of Section 45X PTCs, and possible mezzanine financing options to complement expected customer offtake deposits to reserve G2 capacity,” said the company.

The monetisation of Section 45X PTCs are expected to begin in Q2/Q3 2025, according to the company.

The timeline for the construction of the Austin solar cell plant still remains unchanged, according to the company with a forecast to begin production by Q4 2026. Construction will be carried out in two phases with each phase adding 4 lines and an annual nameplate capacity of 4.8-5.1GW once fully operational.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freyr-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:16:27.938563

The federal government currently gives less money to richer states that can better support Medicaid with their own tax dollars.
House conservatives have also taken aim at the clean energy tax credits created under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the Inflation Reduction Act.
The bill would sharply curtail most big tax credits for clean energy, but it did not eliminate all of the provisions in the law.
There are still other outstanding issues that must be resolved in order for the legislation to pass on the House floor.","The House Budget Committee late Sunday night revived President Trump’s stalled bill to cut taxes and spending, after a handful of fiscally conservative Republicans relented and allowed it to advance even as they continued to press for deeper reductions to health and environmental programs.

The vote signaled a temporary resolution to a remarkable revolt from a group of hard-liners on the panel, who on Friday joined Democrats in opposing the bill in committee, tanking it over concerns that it did not do enough to rein in the nation’s ballooning debt.

On Sunday, after a weekend of intensive negotiations with House Republican leaders and White House officials, they switched their votes to “present,” allowing the measure to move forward without lending their support. It sent the bill past a crucial procedural hurdle but indicated that there was still major trouble ahead for the package, which Speaker Mike Johnson has said he wants the full House to consider before Memorial Day.

“Deliberations continue to this very moment,” Representative Jodey C. Arrington of Texas, the chairman of the panel, said as he opened the session late Sunday night. “They will continue on into the week and, I suspect, right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.”

The vote was 17 to 16, with all four Republicans who initially voted to defeat the legislation — Representatives Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Andrew Clyde of Georgia — voting “present.”

In a lengthy statement on social media minutes after the vote, Mr. Roy said he and the three other conservatives had secured commitments for changes to the bill that include speeding implementation of new work requirements for Medicaid and further curtailing clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act. He did not offer more details about either proposal, and Republican leaders provided no information on what concessions they had promised.

But Mr. Roy did say that “the bill does not yet meet the moment,” and alluded to wanting far deeper cuts to Medicaid, in a sign of the difficult path ahead. The bill goes next to the Rules Committee, which controls whether and how it will be debated on the House floor, including which changes can be made before it comes to a final vote. Two of the holdouts, Mr. Roy and Mr. Norman, are members with the power to block it from advancing from that panel as well.

Democrats on the Budget Committee expressed outrage at being asked to vote on legislation that was still in flux. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the panel, asked Mr. Arrington if lawmakers would be able to view “what side agreements have been reached” before casting their vote.

“Making sure all the members know transparently just what the heck is in this thing,” Mr. Boyle said, “because obviously it’s changing back in that back room by the minute.” That was an allusion to the negotiations Mr. Johnson had continued with the holdouts in an anteroom off the hearing room minutes before the panel met.

Mr. Arrington replied: “I don’t know anything about side deals or any deals. I just know we’re at a place where we can take a vote today.”

The legislation would make President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, fulfilling the president’s campaign promise. It also would raise spending on the military and immigration enforcement. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, education and subsidies for clean energy would offset part of the price of the bill, though they would not cover the entire cost of $3.8 trillion over 10 years.

The four Republicans on the panel voted against the legislation the first time the budget panel met, protesting the timeline for the work requirements for Medicaid recipients — which the bill would not impose until 2029, after the next presidential election — and the provisions targeting the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, which the measure would partially but not completely repeal.

Work requirements are broadly popular among congressional Republicans, and even those who have balked at other cuts to Medicaid have said they could support such requirements.

Mr. Johnson told reporters outside the hearing room minutes before the vote on Sunday night that he had agreed to move up work requirements for Medicaid recipients “as soon as possible.”

“I think the desire of every Republican always has been to make work requirements real and actionable as soon as possible,” he said. “We learned in the process that some of the states would needed a longer lag time to add in the implementation of the new policy. So we’re going to push it as far as we can.”

Mr. Roy in his statement also suggested he wanted Republicans to reconsider proposals to cut Medicaid spending that party leaders had previously ruled out at the behest of more moderate members.

One would limit the way states use a tax loophole to increase federal spending on Medicaid. Big chunks of those savings would come from reducing Medicaid spending in poorer, Southern states.

The other would change the way Medicaid is financed. The federal government currently gives less money to richer states that can better support Medicaid with their own tax dollars. And it gives all states an exceptionally generous matching rate for anyone who signs up through the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.

Mr. Roy called that a “perverse funding structure” that ultimately “increases the likelihood of continuing deficits,” and of states that have yet to expand Medicaid, like Texas, doing so in the future.

House conservatives have also taken aim at the clean energy tax credits created under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the Inflation Reduction Act.

The bill would sharply curtail most big tax credits for clean energy, but it did not eliminate all of the provisions in the law. That was a key demand of the ultraconservatives, who said their party should have no problem repealing a statute that Democrats passed on their own through reconciliation, over unified Republican opposition.

But at least three dozen Republicans in the House, many who represent districts that have benefited from the clean energy tax credits, have called for preserving at least some of the incentives, such as for nuclear power or domestic manufacturing, to protect jobs and bolster U.S. energy security.

There are still other outstanding issues that must be resolved in order for the legislation to pass on the House floor.

When feedstock availability is limited, it hampers renewable diesel production and RIN generation.
Economic Factors – The volatility in traditional diesel prices can influence the financial incentives for producing renewable diesel.
Adjusts to blending requirements or new incentives to stimulate renewable diesel production may be necessary.
For fleet and equipment operators looking to make a change, the path forward with renewable diesel is clear and promising.","Every gallon of renewable fuel produced in the U.S. carries a unique code – a Renewable Identification Number (RIN). These codes are essential to the success of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a key initiative from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and boost the use of renewable fuels in transportation.

Each RIN represents a specific volume of renewable fuel and acts as a key tool to track and enforce compliance with the RFS mandate, ensuring producers meet the required blending targets set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Early 2025 Production

The EPA reported that about 1.5 billion RINs were generated in February 2025, a decrease of more than 25% compared to 2 billion RINs generated in February 2024. This decline continued into March, when 63 million renewable diesel RINs were generated. Domestic producers contributed 36 million of those RINs, with the remainder coming from imports and foreign sources.

In contrast, April saw a remarkable increase in RIN generation. 243 million RD RINs were generated, with 214 million from domestic producers. This increase suggests that production picked up significantly during this month, which might indicate an uptick in demand or production capacity for renewable diesel.

Why Are the RINs Decreasing?

Several factors can contribute to the decrease, including:

Feedstock Availability – Renewable diesel relies on feedstocks like used cooking oils, animal fats, and plant oils, which can be subject to supply fluctuations. When feedstock availability is limited, it hampers renewable diesel production and RIN generation.

Economic Factors – The volatility in traditional diesel prices can influence the financial incentives for producing renewable diesel. When diesel prices drop, the economic justification for producing renewable diesel weakens, leading to fewer RINs being generated.

Policy Adjustments – Changes in renewable fuel mandates and blending requirements can also impact the number of RINs generated. The EPA’s adjustments to the Renewable Fuel Standard can influence production levels and, consequently, RIN generation.

Market Competition – Renewable fuel market is becoming increasingly competitive, with other biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel vying for production capacity. This competition can limit the growth of renewable diesel production, leading to fewer RINs being issued.

What Does This Mean for Renewable Diesel?

With fewer RINs being generated, producers face reduced financial incentives, which could make renewable diesel production less attractive. This reduction in incentives may slow down the industry’s growth and hinder investment in production capacity. At the same time, the decline in RIN generation creates compliance challenges for obligated parties like refineries, which must meet renewable fuel blending quotas. The resulting scarcity of RINs could lead to higher prices, creating market instability and making it more difficult for companies to meet their obligations.

Additionally, the decrease introduces a level of uncertainty in the renewable diesel market. Producers, investors, and stakeholders may hesitate to make long-term investments in renewable diesel production, which could slow the sector’s ability to scale effectively. This uncertainty complicates the industry’s future prospects, as fluctuations in RIN generation and prices make it harder to predict trends and plan for growth.

Given these challenges, there may be a need for a policy response. Adjusts to blending requirements or new incentives to stimulate renewable diesel production may be necessary. These adjustments could help ensure that RD remains a viable and growing segment of the renewable fuel market, providing the stability needed for long-term success.

The landfill produced the third-highest levels of particulate matter and the most carbon monoxide emissions in Tarrant County in 2023.
These measures demonstrate a commitment to minimizing particulate matter emissions as proven by significantly exceeding regulatory requirements, said Ross.
The Report asked Ross to provide more details about Lockheed’s Fort Worth emissions data, but he did not respond before publication.","City-operated landfills, oil and gas facilities, and defense companies led Tarrant County businesses in producing the most carbon monoxide emissions and fine particulate matter in 2023, according to the most recent data collected by the state.

Every year, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality releases data that reflects major air pollution sources across the state. Data lists the amount of harmful chemicals — such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter — generated by industrial facilities, including power plants, oil refineries and those that produce cement, chemicals and metals.

A gas-fueled electric station operated by Constellation Energy in Fort Worth produced the most particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, generating 73 tons per year, according to the data.

Particulate matter is made up of small solid particles or liquid droplets — most often in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke — that can be inhaled and cause serious health problems such as increased respiratory symptoms, asthma, decreased lung function and premature death in people with heart or lung disease, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Following the energy company as top polluters are two landfills, one in Arlington and the other in southeast Fort Worth, each of which produced high levels of particulate matter in Tarrant County in 2023.

As for carbon monoxide, the same Fort Worth landfill produced 103 tons per year, the most out of any other company or entity in 2023, with a Waste Management landfill in Fort Worth coming in just behind.

Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled in large amounts. At very high levels, often indoors or in an enclosed space, carbon monoxide exposure can lead to death.

Although very high levels of carbon monoxide are typically not found outdoors, those with heart disease are especially sensitive to elevated levels of outdoor emissions.

Federal changes could reduce air pollution data collection

Some of the data collected by state environmental regulators supplements the EPA in its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The program was launched 15 years ago to help the federal agency and businesses identify major sources of pollution, devise strategies to cut emissions and develop climate-focused policies.

But the data from 2023 may be the last year polluters are required to report greenhouse emissions as the EPA cuts programs and long-standing regulations.

In an April agency meeting, political appointees announced their plans to disband the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for most industrial facilities, including power plants, oil refineries and those that produce cement, chemicals and metals, according to ProPublica.

The greenhouse gas reporting initiative is modeled after the EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory, created in 1986, said Columbia Law School professor Michael Gerrard, which made it crucial for companies not only to monitor emissions but to discover other pollutants they were previously unaware of generating.

Eliminating the emissions inventory would make it very hard for companies to keep pollutants down, added Gerrard.

“It’s very important that companies understand what their own emissions are so that they can better manage them. It’s important for governments to know who is emitting what, so they can better regulate them,” said Gerrard. “There are many uses for this.”

But regulators say the change at the federal level would not affect the state commission’s regional air monitoring, as statewide pollution data is aimed to comply with other federal air monitoring requirements like the Clean Air Act.

“Engineered to protect the environment”: Tarrant business, local government weigh in

Constellation Energy declined a request to comment on its 2023 particulate matter emissions.

With the Arlington landfill coming in second as a particulate matter polluter while also leading in the top 10 generators of carbon monoxide emissions, city officials said they aim to meet or exceed all state and federal regulations.

“We regularly monitor and report our activities to the TCEQ,” said Arlington asset management director Nora Coronado. “The landfill has been engineered to protect the environment.”

Fort Worth’s landfill has a network of pipes, pumps and wells to capture naturally occuring biogas and safely flare those gases, said city spokesperson Lola McCartney. The landfill produced the third-highest levels of particulate matter and the most carbon monoxide emissions in Tarrant County in 2023.

“The landfill has extensive environmental systems in place to ensure all equipment is working as it should,” said McCartney.

In 2023, aerospace defense company Lockheed Martin produced the fourth-highest levels of particulate matter in Tarrant County at its F-35 jet production facility, data shows.

Although the company produced 10.80 tons per year of the fine particulate matter, which is over the maximum of 10 tons per year allowed according to the EPA, Lockheed Martin spokesperson Kenneth Ross said in a statement the company reported less than half of the limits outlined by the site’s permit granted by the state environmental commission. In accordance with federal law, state environmental permits cap particulate matter 2.5 emissions at 9 micrograms per cubic meter.

Lockheed’s “advanced emission control technologies” allows the company to keep particulate matter emissions from exceeding federal limits, said Ross in the statement.

These measures demonstrate a commitment to minimizing particulate matter emissions as proven by significantly exceeding regulatory requirements, said Ross.

The company has also reduced water usage by 29% and energy usage by 23% since 2010, while growing its employee base from 12,000 to 18,000 in that same timeframe, added Ross.

“Our environmental efforts extend to all aspects of operations,” said Ross.

The Report asked Ross to provide more details about Lockheed’s Fort Worth emissions data, but he did not respond before publication.

Midstream oil and gas operator Oneok, who operated as EnLink Midstream in 2023, produced the seventh-highest levels of carbon monoxide emissions that year.

Safety and the environment are core values at the company, said Oneok spokesperson Brad Borror.

“We commit to a zero-incident culture for the well-being of our employees, contractors and communities and to operating in an environmentally responsible manner,” said Borror.

Regardless of changes at the EPA, the company will continue to comply with the state environmental commission each year, said Borror.

Chemical company Nouryon, General Motors, Waste Management, Bell Textron, Energy Transfer Fuel LP, which all ranked in either the top 10 generators of particulate matter or carbon monoxide emissions respectively, did not respond to the Report’s requests for comment.

Karr Ingham, president of the industry group Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, assures that companies, particularly oil and gas, mitigate emissions as it not only negatively impacts the environment but could backfire economically.

“Losing methane into the atmosphere means that you’re also losing potential revenue from that gas that can be sold. … There is some economic incentive,” said Ingham.

As a result, companies invest in leak detection equipment and technologies to maintain efficiency and environmental safety throughout operations. Additionally, energy companies continue to work with federal officials to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, said Ingham.

“We’ve been engaged with the process in (Washington D.C.) about where the EPA is headed,” said Ingham.

It included provisions to address climate change through incentives for the clean energy through extended and expanded tax credits.
“This wouldn’t just be canceling clean energy projects,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council.
“The impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022,” the analysis states.
According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.","Wisconsin labor and clean energy advocates say a Republican plan in Congress to end or phase-out Biden-era clean energy tax credits could jeopardize thousands of jobs and force some companies to abandon projects.

The House Ways and Means Committee recently released an amendment to Congress’ budget reconciliation package that would rollback tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. The move is part of a large package of tax cuts and program reductions promoted by the Trump administration.

Last week, labor groups and the liberal nonprofit Forward Together held an event to highlight the potential for job loss if the the funding is canceled, saying the cancellation of tax incentives would endanger ongoing projects in Wisconsin.

The IRA was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022. It included provisions to address climate change through incentives for the clean energy through extended and expanded tax credits.

Companies have announced plans to invest more than $840 billion in clean energy projects in the United States since the IRA was passed, but only $321 billion of that private investment had been spent through the first quarter of 2025. That’s according to a report released Tuesday from Clean Investment Monitor, a joint effort between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rhodium Group, a New York-based policy research company.

In Wisconsin, roughly $5.3 billion in total private investment had been announced with more than $2.9 billion spent since the IRA became law, according to a spreadsheet from Clean Investment Monitor.

There were 407 operational jobs and 4,109 construction jobs associated with completed facilities in Wisconsin, and another 175 operational and 2,511 construction jobs expected for announced facilities not yet online, according to the spreadsheet.

“Our members of Congress should be defending and fighting for these jobs and investments in their districts, not threatening them,” said Peter Drummond, executive director of Forward Together Wisconsin.

Electrical workers union leaders from Madison and Greenfield, as well as the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, said Wednesday the climate law led to a boom in clean energy deployment across the state.

They said the plan to gut the IRA’s incentives could result in job losses, creating economic instability for families across Wisconsin.

“This wouldn’t just be canceling clean energy projects,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council. “They’d be canceling opportunities for thousands of our members and undermining Wisconsin’s energy independence.”

But a March 2025 policy analysis from libertarian Cato Institute think tank estimates the energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act will cost between $936 billion and $2 trillion over the next decade, and between $2 trillion and $4.7 trillion by 2050.

“The IRA’s energy subsidies are multiple times larger than initial estimates, and they expose American taxpayers to potentially unlimited liability,” the report states.

The Republican proposal seeks to terminate or phase out a host of federal tax credits for things like electric vehicles, charging stations, residential clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades, utility-scale clean energy and renewable energy manufacturing, according to a preliminary analysis of the proposal by Rhodium Group.

“The impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022,” the analysis states.

The GOP budget reconciliation bill was blocked from advancing to the House floor Friday by hardline House Republicans on the House Budget Committee. According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.

One project in Wisconsin expected to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act is the construction of a new intermediate and middle school in Menasha, after the law allowed nonprofit and local governments to receive direct payments instead of tax credits.

Brian Adesso, director of Business Services for the Menasha Joint School District, said the district expects to receive a reimbursement of nearly $4 million for a rooftop solar, energy storage and geothermal system that are included in the project.

“Without the availability of these credits, we would not have had the certainty we needed to make these projects come to life,” he said. “That would be a huge loss for our district and our community.”

While advocates decry the effort to repeal some of the IRA’s incentives, federal Republicans have been critical of the law almost since its passage. Since 2023, they’ve argued that the law failed to reduce inflation.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, R-De Pere, defended the House GOP’s budget plan, saying it provides tax relief to working-class families.

“We’re committed to reversing the costly Green New Scam policies of the Biden Administration, which led to massive inflation and made life unaffordable for Wisconsinites,” he stated. “While Republicans are focused on lowering costs and supporting the working-class, Democrats continue to push for devastating tax hikes that will hurt everyday Wisconsin families.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24080497315828-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:16:45.599184

What caused the ozone hole?
What is the current status of the ozone hole?
A large and deep ozone hole still forms every Antarctic spring, being deepest and largest towards the end of September, Shanklin told USA TODAY in a May 15 e-mail.
Indeed, though the Antarctic ozone hole shows signs of recovery, the healing process is very slow.","It's been 40 years since groundbreaking research announced the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer, a revelation that launched a rapid and successful effort to ban chemicals in hairspray, deodorant cans and refrigerators that were imperiling the planet.

The 1985 discovery by scientists at the British Antarctic Survey identified a dramatic thinning of the ozone layer over our southernmost continent, triggering immediate global concern about potential harm to human health and ecosystems worldwide.

Located in the stratosphere, the ozone layer acts like sunscreen, blocking potentially harmful ultraviolet energy from reaching our planet's surface. Without it, humans and animals could experience increased rates of skin cancer, DNA damage, cataracts and other ailments. It also affects the physiological and developmental processes of plants.

""The discovery of the ozone hole stands as one of the most important environmental discoveries of the 20th century and demonstrates how robust science, clear communication and international cooperation can address planetary-scale threats,"" said Dominic Hodgson, interim director of science at the British Antarctic Survey, in a statement released May 13.

Jon Shanklin, now an emeritus fellow at the BAS, added that ""publishing our findings in Nature 40 years ago, we couldn’t have anticipated the global response that would follow.""

What caused the ozone hole?

Scientists determined the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were widely used in refrigeration, aerosols, solvents, and fire extinguishers caused the problem.

When chlorine and bromine atoms from CFCs rise and come into contact with ozone in the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules, the Environmental Protection Agency says in an online report. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created, the EPA said.

What is the current status of the ozone hole? Is it recovering?

A large and deep ozone hole still forms every Antarctic spring, being deepest and largest towards the end of September, Shanklin told USA TODAY in a May 15 e-mail. ""There is a very slow recovery, but we’ll still have ozone holes for another 50 years or more.""

Indeed, though the Antarctic ozone hole shows signs of recovery, the healing process is very slow. CFCs have atmospheric lifetimes of more than 50 years, so even without further emissions, a full recovery might not occur until after 2070, the BAS said.

""The current rate of recovery is a bit slower than might be expected, so there could be feedbacks with climate change taking place,"" Shanklin told USA TODAY.

What is the Montreal Protocol?

The discovery of the ozone hole led directly to the Montreal Protocol just two years later – an agreement that froze the production and use of ozone-depleting substances at 1986 levels and set the groundwork for phasing them out entirely.

Today, the protocol stands as one of the most successful international environmental treaties ever implemented. By preventing harmful UV radiation from reaching the Earth’s surface, the agreement has saved thousands of lives, the BAS said.

""The Montreal Protocol is a very successful treaty that all the world’s governments have signed. It is working, with the amount of ozone depleting chemicals in the atmosphere declining as expected,"" Shanklin said in an e-mail to USA TODAY.

What about climate change?

USA TODAY asked Shanklin if there is a regret that we haven’t made similar progress in reducing the human-caused greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

""Very much so,"" Shanklin answered. ""The Montreal Protocol shows what can be done, but with most other environmental issues (climate, biodiversity loss, sewage pollution, soil degradation etc.) there is mostly talk and small-scale action.""

""It is largely because the economic model is flawed and perverse – it assumes that resources are infinite and that there is no cost in using them,"" Shanklin said. ""This perversely then creates all the crises that we could be avoiding.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/15/USAT/83645900007-20000908-t-120000-z-952356006-pbeahulhxeo-rtrmadp-3-earth.JPG?crop=2047,1152,x0,y191&width=2047&height=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-19 11:18:23.279350

New Mexico has already shown what’s possible with bold climate action—from the Energy Transition Act to the Community Benefit Fund.
The Clear Horizons Act can be our next step forward.","New Mexico just accelerated our path forward to build a cleaner, more sustainable future for everyone. With the passage of the Community Benefit Fund (Senate Bill 48) and the Innovation in State Government Fund (Senate Bill 83), the state is proving that smart, community-driven climate action isn’t just possible—it’s already happening.

These wins are the result of years of hard work by advocates, lawmakers, and New Mexicans from across the state who believe in a future where clean energy, good jobs, and resilient communities go hand in hand. The Community Benefit Fund is a groundbreaking initiative that puts real money into local projects that create jobs, expand clean energy, and equip communities to build resilience in the face of climate challenges and adapt to climate changes. Whether it’s building energy-efficient homes, strengthening disaster response centers, or bringing reliable solar and wind power to rural areas, this fund will make a tangible difference in people’s lives.

The Innovation in Government Act will help state agencies tackle climate change head-on by giving them the tools and resources they need to plan for the future. Having strong policies is one thing—but making sure agencies have the funding and capacity to enforce them is just as important. Together, these two bills move New Mexico closer to a future where climate action is proactive rather than reactive.

As exciting as these wins are, New Mexicans know the fight isn’t over. The next big challenge is getting enforceable comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets ready to pass next session—and that work is underway. Recent polling shows that 77% of New Mexicans support the government taking action to reduce carbon and methane pollution that contribute to climate change. The need for action is increasingly urgent as the second Trump administration continues to prioritize corporate profits over the health and wellbeing of us all.

The Clear Horizons Act is the next major step. This bill establishes statewide limits on greenhouse gas emissions, holding polluters accountable and pushing New Mexico toward a carbon-free future.

While the Clear Horizons Act didn’t make it through the legislature this time, momentum is growing. Alongside the Clear Horizons Coalition, we will roll up our sleeves over the next year to make sure comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets cross the finish line next session.

Over the coming months, we’ll bring together businesses, labor groups, Tribal and Navajo leaders, and local communities to make the case that clean energy means good jobs, long-term savings, and a safer future. We’re committed to working together to refine the Clear Horizons Act to make sure it’s ambitious, effective, achievable, and focused on large source emitters —not every day New Mexicans who rely on propane, wood burning stoves, or make their living by ranching.

New Mexico has already shown what’s possible with bold climate action—from the Energy Transition Act to the Community Benefit Fund. The Clear Horizons Act can be our next step forward. The path to clean air, climate justice, and economic opportunity is within reach. Now, we have to work together to make it real.

The Trump administration may not be on board with climate action, but US states and cities are advancing with measures to reduce emissions

With the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and reduced federal climate priorities, we are entering a new era of political uncertainty regarding the way forward in addressing climate change.

The US faces significant climate policy gridlocks marked by executive orders, clawbacks of major climate laws and agency reorganisations. Yet, businesses still face growing climate disclosure requirements through frameworks such as the Science Based Targets initiative guidelines, state regulations and international mandates.

Despite this federal retreat, the reality of the situation for business leaders is clear: meaningful climate action cannot wait for perfect federal alignment. The time for action is now.

While federal leadership has wavered, some state governments have continued to advance climate action. A localised approach, combined with market-driven forces, allows businesses to take meaningful action, even when federal leadership is inconsistent. States are continuing to advance renewable portfolio standards, emissions targets and forward-thinking building codes.

California, leading the world as the fifth-largest economy, has established comprehensive environmental, social and governance regulations that serve as a benchmark for the rest of the nation. In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis has reaffirmed his commitment to emissions reductions. Michigan has experienced an influx of clean energy jobs, while California and Washington have implemented ambitious standards that businesses must navigate regardless of federal direction.

Whether it is making renewable home improvements more affordable or streamlining permits for clean energy technologies, it is possible to be resilient despite a challenging administration.

City action

On a more local level, cities have become powerful climate actors. Climate Mayors, a bipartisan network of nearly 350 mayors representing 60mn Americans, and C40, a global coalition of 100 major cities, have made substantial progress. Through community actions, building performance standards and commitments to net zero, climate leadership is happening.

Boston has implemented carbon zoning requirements, Chicago has transitioned city buildings to 100 per cent clean power, and Austin remains steadfast in adopting its climate equity plan. Cities and businesses working together can achieve greater results in mitigating emissions and climate risk than they could individually.

Whether it is making renewable home improvements more affordable or streamlining permits for clean energy technologies, it is possible to be resilient despite a challenging administration

Waiting for political solutions is not always the best approach, especially with an issue as dire as a warming planet. When I worked on Capitol Hill fresh out of college, tracking climate legislation in 2010, I saw first hand how few bills related to energy and the environment passed both chambers. This led me to the green building industry, where tangible greenhouse gas reductions were made possible regardless of political headwinds. Every green building has a direct impact on reducing emissions.

Forward-thinking companies know there are impactful and compelling reasons for maintaining climate commitments. Managing risks to operations and supply chains, uncovering cost-saving opportunities through efficiency, meeting investor demands for climate transparency, and attracting talent through demonstrated initiatives are just some of them.

There is a clear business case for climate action that extends far beyond mere compliance. Private capital continues to flow towards climate solutions, as seen in initiatives such as Bloomberg’s funding following the Paris Agreement withdrawal. Companies and leaders who embrace proactive climate leadership now position themselves for a competitive advantage in the low-carbon economy of the future.

Market pressure

Market pressures are increasingly reshaping business priorities, regardless of political dynamics. Investors are demanding greater climate risk transparency, while shifting consumer preferences and growing employee activism are pushing companies to take action. Together, these market forces are creating powerful accountability mechanisms that extend beyond government regulation.

Luckily, many in the private sector recognise this. While some companies have scaled back on formal and public net zero work because of the current political narrative, research reveals the majority of businesses remain deeply invested in sustainability.

Recognising that climate action aligns with long-term profitability and risk management, a recent survey by Economist Impact finds 89 per cent of corporate leaders expect sustainability to become a more central focus in the future.

A letter from Ceres shows 71 per cent of companies voluntarily report climate-related disclosures. These statistics demonstrate that leaders see long-term value in climate commitments, regardless of whether they are mandated by federal law.

The climate crisis cannot wait for total political alignment or rely solely on government solutions. Through my work in the built environment, I have witnessed how practical approaches deliver real progress. Science-based target-setting remains crucial, with companies actively seeking standardised frameworks. Investment in decarbonisation strategies, including Scope 3 emissions accounting, continues to drive innovation across sectors.

The time for waiting is over. In the current environment, businesses that demonstrate climate leadership will thrive. The question is no longer whether to act, but how quickly we can implement solutions at hand.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/bf4c778d-7e4b-4c64-a64e-3e136f548848.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:17:09.251807

How Illinois’ energy policy prioritizes equity Illinois’ 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) launched the state’s clean energy transition, baking in equity goals that prioritize opportunities for people who benefited least and were harmed most by the fossil fuel economy.
“Being a part of something here in Decatur that’s really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,” Bennick said.","Powering Rural Futures: Clean energy is creating new jobs in rural America, generating opportunities for people who install solar panels, build wind turbines, weatherize homes, and more. This five-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce.

DECATUR, ILLINOIS — A fistfight at a high school football game nearly defined Shawn Honorable’s life.

It was 1999 when he and a group of teen boys were expelled and faced criminal charges over the incident. The story of the ​“Decatur Seven” drew national headlines and protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who framed their harsh treatment as blatant racism. The governor eventually intervened, and the students were allowed to attend alternative schools.

Honorable, now 41, was encouraged by support ​“from around the world,” but he said the incident was traumatizing and he continued to struggle academically and socially. Over the years, he dabbled in illegal activity and was incarcerated, most recently after a 2017 conviction for accepting a large amount of marijuana sent through the mail.

Today, Honorable is ready to start a new chapter, having graduated with honors last week from a clean energy workforce training program at Richland Community College, located in the Central Illinois city of Decatur. He would eventually like to own or manage a solar company, but he has more immediate plans to start a solar-powered mobile hot dog stand. He’s already chosen the name: Buns on the Run.

“By me going back to school and doing this, it shows my nephews and my little cousins and nieces that it is good to have education,” Honorable said. ​“I know this is going to be the new way of life with solar panels. So I’ll have a step up on everyone. When it comes, I will already be aware of what’s going on with this clean energy thing.”

After decades of layoffs and factory closings, the community of Decatur is also looking to clean energy as a potential springboard.

Located amid soybean fields a three-hour drive from Chicago, the city was long known for its Caterpillar, Firestone Tire, and massive corn-syrup factories. Industrial jobs have been in decline for decades, though, and high rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and incarceration were among the reasons the city was named a clean energy workforce hub funded under Illinois’ 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).

Decatur’s hub, based at Richland Community College, is arguably the most developed and successful of the dozen or so established statewide. That’s thanks in part to TCCI Manufacturing, a local, family-owned factory that makes electric vehicle compressors. TCCI is expanding its operations with a state-of-the-art testing facility and an on-site campus where Richland students will take classes adjacent to the manufacturing floor. The electric truck company Rivian also has a factory 50 miles away.

“The pieces are all coming together,” Kara Demirjian, senior vice president of TCCI Manufacturing, said by email. ​“What makes this region unique is that it’s not just about one company or one product line. It’s about building an entire clean energy ecosystem. The future of EV manufacturing leadership won’t just be on the coasts — it’s being built right here in the Midwest.”

The Decatur CEJA program has also flourished because it was grafted onto a preexisting initiative, EnRich, that helps formerly incarcerated or otherwise disenfranchised people gain new skills and employment. The program is overseen by the Rev. Courtney Carson, a childhood friend of Honorable and another member of the Decatur Seven.

“So many of us suffer significantly from our unmet needs, our unhealed traumas,” said Carson, who was jailed as a young man for gun possession and later drag racing. With the help of mentors including Rev. Jackson and a college basketball coach, he parlayed his past into leadership, becoming associate pastor at a renowned church, leading a highway construction class at Richland, and in 2017 being elected to the same school board that had expelled him.

Carson, now vice president of external relations at the community college, tapped his own experience to shape EnRich as a trauma-informed approach, with wraparound services to help students overcome barriers — from lack of childcare to PTSD to a criminal record. Carson has faith that students can overcome such challenges to build more promising futures, like Decatur itself has done.

“We have all these new opportunities coming in, and there’s a lot of excitement in the city,” Carson said. ​“That’s magnificent. So what has to happen is these individuals who suffered from closures, they have to be reminded that there is hope.”

Getting students ready for the clean energy workforce

Richland Community College’s clean energy jobs training starts with an eight-week life skills course that has long been central to the larger EnRich program. The course uses a Circle of Courage practice inspired by Indigenous communities and helps students prepare to handle stressful workplace situations like being disrespected or even called a racial slur.

“Being called the N-word, couldn’t that make you want to fight somebody? But now you lose your job,” said Carson. ​“We really dive deep into what’s motivating their attitude and those traumas that have significantly impacted their body to make them respond to situations either the right way or the wrong way.”

The training addresses other dynamics that might be unfamiliar to some students — for example, some male students might not be prepared to be supervised by a woman, Carson noted, or others might not be comfortable with LGBTQ+ coworkers.

Life skills are followed by a construction math course crucial to many clean energy and other trades jobs. During a recent class, 24-year-old Brylan Hodges joked with the teacher while converting fractions to decimals and percentages on the whiteboard. He explained that he moved from St. Louis to Decatur in search of opportunity, and he hopes to become a property manager overseeing solar panel installation and energy-efficiency upgrades on buildings.

Students take an eight-hour primer in clean energy fields including electric vehicles, solar, HVAC, and home energy auditing. Then they choose a clean energy track to pursue, leading to professional certifications as well as a chance to continue at Richland for an associate degree. Under the state-funded program, students are paid for their time attending classes.

Marcus James was part of the first cohort to start the program last October, just days after his release from prison.

He was an 18-year-old living in Memphis, Tennessee, when someone shot at him, as he describes it, and he fired back, with fatal consequences. He was convicted of murder and spent 12 years behind bars. After his release he made his way to Decatur, looking for a safer place to raise his kids. Adjusting to life on the outside wasn’t easy, and he ended up back in prison for a year and a half on DUI and drug possession charges.

Following his release, he was determined to turn his life around.

“After I brought my kids up here, I end up going back to prison. But at that moment, I realized, man, I had to change,” James told a crowd at an event celebrating the clean jobs program in March.

James said that at first, he showed up late to every class. But soon the lessons sank in, and he was never late again. He always paid attention when people talked, and he gained new confidence.

“As long as I put my mind to it, I can do it,” said James, who would like to work as a home energy auditor. Richland partners with the energy utility Ameren to place trainees in such positions.

“I like being out in the field, learning new stuff, dealing with homes, helping people,” James said, noting he made energy-efficiency improvements to his own home after the course.

How Illinois’ energy policy prioritizes equity

Illinois’ 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) launched the state’s clean energy transition, baking in equity goals that prioritize opportunities for people who benefited least and were harmed most by the fossil fuel economy. It created programs to deploy solar arrays and provide job training in marginalized and environmental justice communities.

FEJA’s rollout was rocky. Funding for equity-focused solar installations went unspent while workforce programs struggled to recruit trainees and connect them with jobs. The pandemic didn’t help. The follow-up legislation, CEJA, expanded workforce training programs and remedied snafus in the original law.

Melissa Gombar is principal director of workforce development programs for Elevate, a Chicago-based national nonprofit organization that oversaw FEJA job training and subcontracts for a Chicago-area CEJA hub. Gombar said many community organizations tasked with running FEJA training programs were relatively small and grassroots, so they had to scramble to build new financial and human resources infrastructure.

“They have to have certain policies in place for hiring and procurement. The influx of grant money might have doubled their budget,” Gombar said. Meanwhile, the state employees tasked with helping the groups ​“are really talented and skilled, trying their best, but they’re overburdened because of the large lift.”

CEJA, by contrast, tapped community colleges like Richland, which already had robust infrastructure and staffing. CEJA also funds community organizations to serve as ​“navigators,” using the trust and credibility they’ve developed in communities to recruit trainees.

Richland Community College received $2.6 million from April 2024 through June 2025, and the Community Foundation of Macon County, the hub’s navigator, received $440,000 for the same time period. The other hubs similarly received between $1 million and $3.3 million for the past year, and state officials have said the same level of funding will be allocated for each of the next two years, according to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.

CEJA hubs also include social service providers that connect trainees with wraparound support; businesses like TCCI that offer jobs; and affiliated entrepreneur incubators that help people start their own clean energy businesses. CEJA also funded apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs with labor unions, which are often a prerequisite for employment in utility-scale solar and wind.

“The sum of the parts is greater than the whole,” said Drew Keiser, TCCI vice president of global human resources. ​“The navigator is saying, ​‘Hey, I’ve connected with this portion of the population that’s been overlooked or underserved.’ OK, once you get them trained, send their resumes to me, and I’ll get them interviewed. We’re seeing a real pipeline into careers.”

The hub partners go to great lengths to aid students — for example, coordinating and often paying for transportation, childcare, or even car repairs.

“If you need some help, they always there for you,” James said.

What’s next for Decatur and its clean energy trainees?

In 1984, TCCI began making vehicle compressors in a Decatur plant formerly used to build Sherman tanks during World War II. A few decades later, the company began producing compressors for electric vehicles, which are much more elaborate and sensitive than those for internal combustion engines.

In August 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker joined TCCI President Richard Demirjian, the Decatur mayor, and college officials for the groundbreaking of an Electric Vehicle Innovation Hub, which will include a climatic research facility — basically a high-tech wind tunnel where companies and researchers from across the world can send EV chargers, batteries, compressors, and other components for testing in extreme temperatures, rain, and wind.

A $21.3 million capital grant and a $2.2 million electric vehicle incentive from the state are funding the wind tunnel and the new facilities where Richland classes will be held. In 2022, Pritzker announced these investments as furthering the state goal of 1 million EVs on the road by 2030.

“Being a part of something here in Decatur that’s really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,” Bennick said. ​“It can be done here in the middle of the cornfields. We want to show people a framework that they can take and scale in other places.”

With graduation behind him, Honorable is planning the types of hot dogs and sausages he’ll sell at Buns on the Run. He said Tamika Thomas, director of the CEJA program at Richland, has also encouraged him to consider teaching so he can share the clean energy skills he’s learned with others. The world seems wide open with possibilities.

“A little at a time — I’m going to focus on the tasks in front of me that I’m passionate about, and then see what’s next,” Honorable said. He invoked a favorite scene from the cartoon TV series ​“The Flintstones,” in which the characters’ leg power, rather than wheels and batteries, propelled vehicles: ​“Like Fred and Barney, I’ll be up and running.”

Community solar is a powerful movement that is quietly reshaping the renewable power landscape in the United States. Across the country, local projects are giving businesses and households an opportunity to tap into solar energy, even if they cannot install panels on their rooftops themselves.

The shift toward community solar is not just about advancing technology or cost savings — it is about building stronger communities by broadening access and accelerating the transition to clean energy.

What Is Community Solar?

Community solar refers to local solar power installations shared by multiple subscribers who receive electricity bill credits for their share of the power produced. In most cases, subscribers save on their electricity expenses, depending on the program design and prevailing rates.

The model is especially beneficial for renters and those with shaded roofs because it eliminates the need to install solar panels individually. Community solar stands out as a scalable and flexible renewable energy model because it circumvents traditional solar power adoption by addressing high energy costs and overcoming limitations due to space and home ownership.

Benefits of Community Solar Adoption

Beyond lowering utility bills, community solar plays a major role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonizing the grid, and reducing fossil fuel reliance. It also helps create a variety of local jobs, keeping more energy dollars circulating within the community. Because some programs prioritize low-income households, clean energy also becomes more accessible and equitable.

Sustainability and longevity are also key reasons why this program is advantageous. Rigid solar panels — commonly used in high-output solar farms because of their durability and heat resistance — maintain high efficiency even in extreme or fluctuating heat conditions.

Local Initiatives Leading the Way

Community solar adoption is already happening in towns, neighborhoods and cities across the U.S., powered by partnerships between developers, utilities, corporations and local governments. There is at least one community solar project in 44 areas in the country. Notable collaborations include: Microsoft and Nexamp

In May 2025, clean energy firm Nexamp announced that it signed a deal with Microsoft to support around 100 new community solar projects — totaling 300 megawatts — across five independent system operator regions in the U.S. The project prioritizes areas that have not experienced the environmental and economic benefits of solar energy yet. It is set to roll out in the next four years, aligning with Microsoft's goal to become carbon-negative by 2030.

Shared Solar Program in Virginia

Virginia passed laws in 2020 to create the Shared Solar Program, which provides Dominion Energy Virginia customers the chance to subscribe and get credits on their monthly electricity bill. The initiative prioritizes renters, building occupants, those with shaded or poor roofing conditions, and homeowners who cannot buy their own solar panels. Customers pay a minimum amount to the utility provider to cover distribution and infrastructure maintenance work.

As evidence of the push toward clean energy use, the Community Solar Consumer Choice Act of 2023 aims to broaden access to solar programs by instructing the Department of Energy to support initiatives for its growth. The bill also seeks to extend the length of contracts between public utilities and the federal government, thus encouraging investment and greater stability.

Cost of Community Solar Programs

The benefits of community solar are clear, but it is equally important to understand the financial considerations.

On the upside, most solar programs have no upfront costs, eliminating one of the largest roadblocks to adoption. Subscribers can sign up and start receiving credits on their electric bills. This model helps underserved households get on board with the transition to clean energy.

On the downside, actual cost savings are unpredictable. When contract terms are unclear or market conditions shift, some customers may even receive higher rates compared to their standard utility expenses. Regulatory hurdles can also slow down project rollouts and increase administrative and operating costs, which may be passed on to consumers later.

Building a Clean Future Through Community Solar

The need for resilient energy resources increases as climate change intensifies. Community solar programs have the ability to distribute power across many sites, making it accessible to more people across different economic backgrounds. From small towns in Maine to corporate locations in the Midwest, the community solar movement is laying the foundation for a cleaner, more sustainable, and more equitable energy future.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/051925EPsolarpanels.jpeg,N,,2025-05-19 11:17:22.182755

The United Kingdom has adopted numerous policy instruments to scale back the domestic fossil fuel industry while propping up clean energy generation.
And the pressure on the oil and gas industry seems to be working – perhaps a little too well.
Projects that could offer jobs to laid-off fossil fuel workers are facing “repeated delays” and potentially untenable financial circumstances.
The BBC notes that the slew of canceled and delayed clean energy projects could be driven by a number of causes, many of which have little to do with the invisible hand.","The United Kingdom’s green energy transition is facing a dangerous slowdown at a critical moment for the economy and the environment. The Labour Party has ambitiously planned for British energy output to be 95% clean by 2030, but many stalled renewable energy projects show that the sector may be contracting just when the government is pushing for expansion.

The United Kingdom has adopted numerous policy instruments to scale back the domestic fossil fuel industry while propping up clean energy generation. And the pressure on the oil and gas industry seems to be working – perhaps a little too well. Just last month, oil and gas firm Harbour Energy announced that it would axe hundreds of jobs in the North Sea, and thousands more positions are at risk, with little to no contingency plan for those workers. And while the government has agreed to issue a limited number of new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea, these licenses are currently being challenged in court. What’s more, oil and gas reserves in the North Sea are dwindling.

But while oil and gas are indeed on the decline, clean energy projects are not stepping in to take their place at nearly the desired rate. Projects that could offer jobs to laid-off fossil fuel workers are facing “repeated delays” and potentially untenable financial circumstances. “And the gap between one industry declining and the other rising is growing wider,” according to the BBC. This could spell major trouble not only for British laborers but also for the nation’s energy security.

The BBC notes that the slew of canceled and delayed clean energy projects could be driven by a number of causes, many of which have little to do with the invisible hand. “Because the UK government has set such an ambitious and high-profile target for clean, green power, it may be that [clean energy sector] developers are using the leverage of a halted project to get a more attractive set of price guarantees,” the BBC speculates. “It may also be that Harbour Energy is backing up the wider oil and gas industry in putting pressure on the UK government to give it a less hostile business environment,” the report goes on to note. “It took only a few minutes from the announcement of Harbour's job losses to Prime Minister's Questions, with both the Conservatives and SNP piling on the pressure.”

Clearly, creating a smooth and just clean energy transition is far from easy. Research from campaign group Oil Change International has estimated that transitioning to a renewable-powered grid without leaving oil and gas workers in the dust will cost the United Kingdom about £1.9 billion per year. “Of this, about £1.1bn would be needed to help develop the wind industry and create new green jobs; about £440m would be needed to invest in ports to make them capable of constructing and maintaining offshore wind turbines; and £355m would cover a training fund for oil and gas workers,” the Guardian reports.

Not only is the power struggle over the terms and conditions of the United Kingdom’s clean energy transition leaving many Brits in the lurch, it’s also creating a major threat to the nation’s energy security and climate goals. Without a strong renewables sector to take the place of the flagging fossil fuels industry, Great Britain will remain dangerously dependent on imported natural gas in an era of extreme political and geopolitical tensions, and all of the price volatility that comes with it.

This is bad news for British consumers, who have been battered by high energy prices over the past few years thanks to the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and retaliatory tariffs placed on the Kremlin, one of the world’s key suppliers of oil and gas. Recent estimates suggest that approximately 11% of households in England are classed as fuel poor, 34% in Scotland, 14% in Wales, and 24% in Northern Ireland. This means that these households must spend a high proportion of their income to keep their home at a reasonable temperature.

A new call seeking proposals which could help accelerate Ireland’s clean energy transition has been launched by the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI).

With support from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, SEAI will invest around €19m in a pipeline of energy research, development and demonstration (RD&D) projects over a number of years.

The 2025 call includes two strands, a themed one and an open one. The thematic strand includes research topics co-developed by SEAI in consultation with Government departments and agencies. These themes include heat, electricity, grid flexibility, electric vehicle grants, energy modelling, maritime transport and energy poverty, among others.

While the open strand is available to any research that contributes to Ireland’s clean energy transition.

This year, the call includes co-funding partnerships with Met Éireann, the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The deadline to apply for the funding programme is on 1 July 2025.

The call is a part of SEAI’s National Energy RD&D programme, which has funded more than 240 projects upwards of €100m over the past six years.

These projects bring solutions to a wide array of energy solutions, including wind, bioenergy, energy markets, smart grids, transportation and energy policy, among others.

In addition to launching the funding call today (19 May), SEAI has also released the first impact report for the National Energy RD&D programme.

The report states that more than 100 projects – resulting in more than 60 software tools, platforms and models – came out of the programme between 2018 and 2019.

In that time period, the programme spent more than €3.2m in co-funding, supporting dozens of researchers and students along the way.

“Research and innovation are vital enablers for delivery of Ireland’s energy and climate ambitions,” said Minister for Climate, Environment and Energy Darragh O’Brien, TD.

The director of research and policy insight at SEAI, Margie McCarthy, said that fostering an environment of advanced research is a pivotal step to address the pressing challenges of energy sustainability and efficiency.

“SEAI supports for research, development and demonstration aim to drive advancements that will benefit our communities and contribute significantly to Ireland’s national strategy for a sustainable future.”

Last week, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science James Lawless, TD, told third-level institutions in the country that his department intends to place “particular emphasis” on strengthening Ireland’s research performance.

All have a significant presence in Michigan, which is home to 347 known or suspected sites of PFAS contamination.
Leaders of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the National Rural Water Association, which represent drinking water providers, lauded Wednesday’s announcement of a deadline extension.
Several groups representing drinking water providers had sued the federal government over the Biden-era PFAS standards, arguing that the cost of filtering PFAS out of drinking water will be too high.
Representatives of Michigan’s drinking water sector had a more muted reaction.","The Trump administration has announced plans to rescind drinking-water limits on four PFAS “forever chemical” compounds while extending the compliance deadline for two others, in a move that outraged victims of Michigan’s widespread PFAS contamination.

Nationwide regulations limiting allowable levels of PFOA and PFOS — two of the most common among thousands of PFAS compounds — now won’t take effect until 2031, which is two years later than previously scheduled. There will no longer be a federal limit on PFHxS, PFNA, GenX or PFBS, four other compounds that the Biden administration had moved to regulate last year.

Michigan’s state-level drinking water standards will continue to limit the compounds that the federal government no longer wants to regulate. However, several of those state-level standards are weaker than the federal ones the EPA is rescinding.

Biden’s EPA created the nation’s first enforceable drinking water limits on PFAS in 2024, responding to mounting evidence that has linked various PFAS compounds to cancer and other health risks. Water systems were given until 2029 to comply.

In a statement Wednesday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin called that deadline too aggressive and said the Trump administration’s planned extension would offer “common-sense flexibility” while drinking water providers take measures to stay beneath the limits.

“This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants,” he added.

The announcement drew cheers from national groups representing water utilities, which have raised concerns about high costs to install PFAS filtration systems, and outrage from PFAS activists who called the rollbacks a victory for chemical companies at the expense of Americans’ health.

“These actions will undoubtedly make the drinking water of millions of people across the country less safe,” said Tony Spaniola, co-chair of the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network.

If the EPA follows through on its plans, he said, lawsuits are likely to follow.

“We haven’t heard the last of this by any stretch of the imagination,” he said, “but man, I would much rather be in the position we were in a year ago, when these things were moving forward and we had a Justice Department and an EPA that was going to vigorously defend them.”

Known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily in the environment, PFAS — short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — have been heavily used by industry and present in common household products for decades. While some PFAS manufacturers knew long ago that their products were toxic, the chemicals went largely unregulated until recently, when a widening contamination crisis began to make headlines in Michigan and around the globe.

The most heavily polluted sites are associated with the military and industry, including paper mills, metal plating operations, textile manufacturers and airports. All have a significant presence in Michigan, which is home to 347 known or suspected sites of PFAS contamination.

If the EPA follows through with its planned rollbacks, Michigan’s drinking water will remain better protected against PFAS than the water in most other states, because state officials took the unusual step in 2020 of enacting their own drinking water standards for seven compounds.

However, some of those state-level limits are weaker than the limits enacted by Biden’s EPA, and their future hangs in the balance after chemical company 3-M sued the state in hopes of voiding them.

‘Years of progress’

In Oscoda, where PFAS used on a now-defunct Air Force base has caused widespread groundwater and surface water contamination, one of the main sources of pollution would now be left unregulated at the federal level. Michigan’s limit for that compound, known as PFHxS, is far less stringent.

Spaniola, who owns a cabin in Oscoda, said the plan to lift limits on several PFAS chemicals “undoes years of progress” to protect the health of residents in Oscoda and other communities.

Leaders of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the National Rural Water Association, which represent drinking water providers, lauded Wednesday’s announcement of a deadline extension.

Several groups representing drinking water providers had sued the federal government over the Biden-era PFAS standards, arguing that the cost of filtering PFAS out of drinking water will be too high. It’s not clear whether those lawsuits will continue in light of Wednesday’s announcement.

However, Congress is considering a budget reconciliation bill that could cut funding and put a damper on union jobs and private investment.

Dana Kuhnline, program director for the coalition ReImagine Appalachia, said funds included in the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act could be lost.

""One of the reasons that's so harmful for our region is that a huge percentage of the Inflation Reduction Act was targeted with special provisions for communities that had seen a downturn from manufacturing and other industry loss, to try and build those industries back up,"" Kuhnline explained.

According to data from the Center for American Progress, Ohio has seen a record $11 billion in investments and created more than 4,700 jobs since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2021.

Rike Rothenstein, senior research associate for ReImagine Appalachia, said Ohio leads four Appalachian states with a total of $40 billion in public and private investments. She noted federal money helped spur economic growth and drove companies to the region.

""It is really the private investment that was significantly responsible for that renaissance,"" Rothenstein emphasized. ""For that push and strengthening of U.S. manufacturing in the region.""

As the Appalachian Trail turns 100, conservation groups are sounding alarms over federal funding freezes and staff cuts.

The trail runs through the broader Appalachian region, including parts of southern Ohio and is a popular destination for thousands of Ohio hikers. Conservation groups warned recent layoffs at the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service could slow maintenance and repair work on the 2,200-mile trail.

Hawk Metheny, vice president of trail management for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, said Federal funds remain tied up in Congress, leaving local volunteers to carry the weight.

""We're carrying on. We've been here 100 years and we'll endure through this,"" Metheny emphasized. ""It is the people's trail, the citizens' trail, so it's an all-hands effort.""

More than 3 million people visit the Appalachian Trail each year. In Ohio, the outdoor recreation economy supports more than 125,000 jobs and brings in $11.8 billion annually, according to the Outdoor Industry Association.

Metheny noted recent extreme weather, such as flooding from Hurricane Helene, has damaged hundreds of trail miles. Volunteers have stepped in to relocate or reinforce affected areas but long-term stability requires federal support for land conservation and public access.

""It's an important resource for scenic values, recreational values, wildlife habitat, biodiversity protection,"" Metheny outlined. ""The AT provides all those values across the entirety of the Appalachians from Georgia to Maine.""

Several Ohio-based groups, including the Buckeye Trail Association, said public lands and trail systems provide vital health and tourism benefits. Events along the Appalachian Trail this summer aim to raise awareness and celebrate a century of stewardship and public access.

The dismantling of the 30-year-old AmeriCorps national service program by the Department of Government Efficiency will have significant effects in New Mexico.

Last year, AmeriCorps recruited more than 4,500 participants in the state to help meet local needs and strengthen communities. Program grants are administered by the Serve New Mexico Commission, working under the Department of Workforce Solutions.

Kristin Hsueh, executive director of the commission, said funding was eliminated for a planning grant and six of 10 operational programs, leaving only four still functioning.

""These program were offering services to the communities, everything from tutoring to after-school programming, mentorship, trail restoration,"" Hsueh outlined. ""It's a significant cut, it's almost about two-thirds of our programs.""

New Mexico has joined 24 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit suing over the Trump administration's cuts. The state's Attorney General said the action will hurt students, families and underserved communities. In New Mexico, a fourth of all AmeriCorps workers identify as Hispanic or Latino, the highest percentage in the nation.

Hsueh pointed out at least 84 AmeriCorps members in New Mexico were affected immediately, and 100 who were expected to participate this summer have been notified their positions have been defunded. She noted members and senior volunteers have previously served at more than 300 locations across the state.

""They are gaining a lot of experience,"" Hsueh observed. ""They are serving something that's greater than themselves, which is really what AmeriCorps is all about, dedicating a portion of your life to make sure that you are improving the lives of others.""

Initially known as Volunteers in Service to America or VISTA, AmeriCorps was created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 and renamed under President Bill Clinton. Nationwide, more than 75,000 people work in service each year, with land trusts, schools, public agencies and community and faith-based groups. Funding made up less than 1% of the federal budget.

Results of a new survey of nearly 900 small business owners across the country show they are concerned about an uncertain economy, including the owners of small mom and pop operations in Nebraska.

The survey, conducted by Small Business for America's Future, shows that nearly 70% of small business owners think the Trump administration fell short on economic leadership during its first 100 days.

They cited tariffs as a key factor in creating instability.

Gladys Harrison, owner of Big Mama's Kitchen and Catering in Omaha, said the tariffs will affect the cost of the imported seasonings she uses for her family's oven-fried chicken recipe.

""They're telling me,"" said Harrison, ""that they could see a 25% to 145% increase with these tariffs in what they're going to charge me for my seasonings.""

The Trump administration has said it is imposing tariffs in an effort to create more U.S.-based jobs and improve the domestic economy.

Harrison said she is thinking of ways to avoid closing her doors or passing the price increases on to her loyal customers, many of whom have been eating Big Mama's fried chicken for generations.

""And we don't want to have our food so expensive,"" said Harrison, ""that the people who live and work in our community can't come and spend their money with us.""

Harrison said higher costs will also hinder her ability to be involved in the community, a tradition she said her mother and grandmother taught her was critical to any small, family-owned business.

Brian Bienkowski reports for The New Lede.

In short:

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers issued a memo in March narrowing the Clean Water Act’s scope following the Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA decision, removing protections for wetlands connected by ditches or culverts.

Industry groups such as homebuilders and agricultural associations support the change, citing long-standing confusion and regulatory burden, while tribes and environmental advocates warn it weakens water safeguards and threatens treaty rights.

Over half of Iowa’s rivers and streams and two-thirds of its lakes are already impaired, largely due to agricultural runoff, with many affected waterways serving as sources of public drinking water.

Key quote:

“Removing a large number of both wetlands and streams from those basic protections will bring us back to a period of water insecurity that Americans have forgotten and probably do not want to relive.”

— Jim Murphy, director of legal advocacy, National Wildlife Federation

Why this matters:

When the federal government pulls back protections under the Clean Water Act, the effects ripple. Many small and seasonal streams feed into the rivers and lakes that supply drinking water for millions of Americans. Wetlands, often dismissed as inconvenient swamps, play a key role in absorbing floodwaters, filtering pollutants, and sustaining biodiversity. Without federal oversight, states with powerful agricultural lobbies may struggle — or decline — to regulate pollution from fertilizer and manure runoff. In places like Iowa, this means more nitrates in drinking water, a chemical linked to birth defects and cancer.

Meanwhile, tribal communities with already limited authority over their water may find themselves increasingly sidelined. The Trump administration’s tighter interpretation of WOTUS may simplify regulations for some industries, but it also puts ecosystems and public health at greater risk, especially as climate change increases the frequency of floods and droughts.

Mr. Trump dismisses the threats posed by climate change, suggesting that rising seas would create more “oceanfront property.” He blames “climate lunatics” for environmental regulations that he says have been a drag on the U.S. economy.
At the most basic level, the Trump administration is dismantling the government’s ability to monitor a rapidly changing climate.
Last month, the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been working on the National Climate Assessment, a report mandated by Congress that details how global warming is affecting specific regions across the country.
The administration has purged the phrases “climate crisis” and “climate science” from government websites.","When the Trump administration declared two weeks ago that it would largely disregard the economic cost of climate change as it sets policies and regulations, it was just the latest step in a multipronged effort to erase global warming from the American agenda.

But President Trump is doing more than just turning a blind eye to the fact that the planet is growing hotter. He is weakening the country’s capacity to understand global warming and to prepare for its consequences.

The administration has dismantled climate research, firing some of the nation’s top scientists, and gutted efforts to chart how fast greenhouse gases are building up in the atmosphere and what that means for the economy, employment, agriculture, health and other aspects of American society. The government will no longer track major sources of greenhouse gases, data that has been used to measure the scale and identify sources of the problem for the past 15 years.

“We’re not doing that climate change, you know, crud, anymore,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told Fox Business on May 8.

By getting rid of data, the administration is trying to halt the national discussion about how to deal with global warming, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The notion of there being any shared factual reality just seems to be completely out the window,” he said.

At the same time, through cuts to the National Weather Service and by denying disaster relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the administration has weakened the country’s ability to prepare for and recover from hurricanes, wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather that is being made worse by climate change.

The president is also moving to loosen restrictions on air pollution, which experts say will lead to more planet warming emissions, and to overturn the government’s legal authority to regulate those gases.

Taken together, these moves are poised to leave the world’s biggest economy less informed, less prepared and, over time, more polluted.

Mr. Trump dismisses the threats posed by climate change, suggesting that rising seas would create more “oceanfront property.” He blames “climate lunatics” for environmental regulations that he says have been a drag on the U.S. economy.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump declared a national energy emergency, something that experts dispute because the United States is producing more oil than any country in history and is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas. Mr. Trump has cited the emergency as justification for speeding approvals for oil, gas and coal projects and expanding logging in national forests.

Some agree that reforms to the nation’s environmental regulations were overdue. Complex and lengthy processes to get permits to build pipelines, transmission lines and drilling projects have also meant significant delays for wind farms, solar projects and other clean energy, said Robert Stavins, a professor of energy and economic development at Harvard University.

“Permitting as whole in the United States is just a mess,” he said.

But the president has gone much further than just trying to speed up permits. He’s made the American government a global outlier in its denial of science.

“It’s as if we’re in the Dark Ages,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

At the most basic level, the Trump administration is dismantling the government’s ability to monitor a rapidly changing climate.

Last month, the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been working on the National Climate Assessment, a report mandated by Congress that details how global warming is affecting specific regions across the country.

In recent weeks, more than 500 people have left the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the government’s premier agency for climate and weather science. That has led the National Weather Service, an agency within NOAA, to warn of “degraded operations.”

NOAA also stopped monthly briefing calls on climate change, and the president’s proposed budget would eliminate funding for the agency’s weather and climate research. The administration has purged the phrases “climate crisis” and “climate science” from government websites.

The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting effort spearheaded by the billionaire Elon Musk, has proposed closing a NOAA observatory in Hawaii that has been continuously monitoring greenhouse gas levels since 1958.

The data collected there were used to create the Keeling Curve, a well-known graph that showed the sharp recent rise in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. The data from Hawaii and other NOAA monitoring stations are shared with scientists around the globe and inform international climate negotiations.

“The lack of scientific data collection is going to harm our ability to understand the natural and physical world,” said Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union. “It’s also going to impact our ability to provide early warning systems for severe storms or the next wildfire. It’s going to have an impact on lives.”

A spokesman for the Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, defended the cuts, saying that the agency was exploring new ways to collect data and did not expect disruptions to weather forecasting.

The capacity to respond

Instead, the White House is trying to shift responsibility to the states. The administration has canceled a FEMA program aimed at making communities more resilient before disasters hit, calling it “wasteful and ineffective.” And it said FEMA staffers would no longer go door to door to help survivors after a catastrophe.

In a statement, a spokesman for the National Security Council said that when disasters strike, states must have “an appetite to own the problem.”

“The Trump administration is reforming a broken disaster relief system that has repeatedly let Americans down,” said Kush Desai, an administration spokesman. “Instead of doling out blank checks, the administration is working with state and local governments to proactively make investments and enact common sense policies that prioritize disaster preparedness and resilience.”

As human-caused global warming increases, disasters are becoming more frequent, destructive and expensive. There were just three billion-dollar disasters in the United States in 1980, but that total increased to 27 last year, according to data collected by NOAA. The agency said last week that it would no longer tally and publicly report the costs of extreme weather.

Daniel Kaniewski, who served as FEMA’s acting deputy administrator during the first Trump administration, said it made little sense to cut programs that help harden communities against extreme weather.

“The longer we go without these programs, the more risk will accrue to these communities and the nation,” said Mr. Kaniewski, who is now a managing director at Marsh McLennan, an insurance broker and risk adviser. “And soon enough, we’ll all bear the consequences.”

Going into hurricane season, FEMA is being run by an acting administrator with no experience in emergency management. As of May 8, the agency had available about half as many staff members trained to respond to disasters as it did at the same time last year, according to agency documents. That follows months of downsizing at FEMA through resignations and layoffs.

FEMA has recently denied some requests for assistance from Arkansas, where a series of tornadoes in March was followed by a second round of destructive weather, including flooding and hail. It also rejected requests from several counties in West Virginia where February floods caused extensive damage; Washington State, which was battered by windstorms; and North Carolina, which is still trying to recover from Hurricane Helene, which destroyed 1,000 homes last year.

Jonas Anderson, the mayor of Cave City, Ark., population 1,994, where a tornado destroyed more than 20 homes and many local businesses, said FEMA’s denial of community assistance was “shocking and disappointing.”

“It’s pretty rough on people,” Mr. Anderson said.

Slashing regulations

The Environmental Protection Agency, which has been the government’s lead agency in terms of measuring and controlling greenhouse gas emissions, is being overhauled to end those functions. The administration is shredding the E.P.A.’s staff and budget and wants to revoke its two most powerful climate regulations: limits on pollution from tailpipes and smokestacks.

Mr. Trump has said that relaxing limits on pollution from automobiles wouldn’t “mean a damn bit of difference to the environment.”

But transportation is the largest single source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States and its pollution is linked to asthma, heart disease, other health problems and premature deaths.

Sensing an opening, two major chemical industry trade groups, have asked the E.P.A. administrator, Lee Zeldin, for a complete exemption from limits on hazardous pollution.

“Rolling back regulations will have a catastrophic effect on health in America,” said Harold Wimmer, the chief executive of the American Lung Association.

Throttling the energy transition

Mr. Trump has made no secret of his hostility toward wind power, along with most of the clean energy technologies that would help the country pivot away from oil, gas and coal and reduce the emissions driving climate change.

But actions by his administration last month shocked many observers. It ordered a stop to construction that was underway on a wind farm off the coast of Long Island.

That wind farm, developed by Norway-based Equinor, had received all necessary permits in 2023 — after nearly four years of environmental reviews — along with $3 billion in financing. The project, which been expected to provide electricity to 500,000 homes by 2027, was about 30 percent complete when the stop work order was issued.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested on social media that the permits had been rushed. Equinor is considering legal action.

“To stop a project that already has all its federal permits is fairly unprecedented, especially at a large scale, like this,” said Robert Freudenberg, vice president of energy and environmental programs for Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that works to promote development in the area around New York City. “It shows how determined they are to hurt this industry.”

Around the world, countries are racing to adapt to a rapidly warming planet, reduce pollution and build clean energy. China, the only other superpower, has made a strategic decision to adopt clean energy and then sell it abroad, dominating the global markets for electric vehicles, solar panels and other technologies. Even Saudi Arabia, the second-largest producer of oil after the United States, is spending heavily on wind and solar power.

Average global temperatures last year were the hottest on record and 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a threshold that nations had been working to avoid. Every fraction of a degree of additional warming raises the risk of severe effects and possibly irreversible changes to the planet. Nations must make deep and fast cuts to pollution to avoid a grim future of increasingly violent weather, deadly heat waves, drought, water scarcity and displacement, scientists have said.

But at this perilous moment, the United States is virtually alone in the world in rejecting climate science.

“Here we see a government that is taking a hatchet to the scientific enterprise,” Ms. Cleetus said. “It’s the kind of destruction that will have implications for a while to come.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/02/multimedia/00cli-blindeye-01-kjlc/00cli-blindeye-01-kjlc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:33.921144

A Washington DC district appeals court will hear arguments to determine whether to affirm or deny a federal court’s preliminary injunction issued, and then “stayed,” last month.

The awardees were bracing themselves for an unfavorable ruling from the Trump appointee-dominated appeals panel. An affirmative ruling would unfreeze the funds, held in a custodial account at Citibank, unleashing much needed capital to the nine plaintiffs that have been unable to pay staff or fulfill loans and technical assistance grants since mid-February. The opposite could give the EPA a greenlight to reclaim the funds.

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, sought to catalyze a nationwide green lending infrastructure that could finance pollution-reducing projects that benefit rural and low-income communities and mobilize private capital. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has painted the program as rife with fraud and abuse, and its recipients as unqualified and conflicted, without providing any evidence. Despite broad-based subpoenas — the pretext for freezing the funds — government officials have uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing or malfeasance, according to a New York Times report.

A new analysis by Energy Innovation found that the program power up to 2.2 million homes with solar power each year, save consumers $52 billion in energy costs over the next 20 years, and spur $65.5 billion in private investment.

If the appeals court affirms the preliminary injunction issued by federal Judge Tanya Chutkan in mid-April, the best case scenario for green bank awardees, Citi would have no choice but to release the funds. The EPA would likely try to terminate the GGRF program again, but would have to go through prescribed rules, buying the green bank grantees time. Alternatively, the appeals court could reject the earlier court’s ruling, enabling the government to claw back the Congressionally appropriated funds. In between those bookends, one person close to the suit said, are numerous possible scenarios, all almost certainly involving appeals and counter-appeals and potentially leading to the Supreme Court.

The drawn out legal battle is already taking a toll. Last week, Rewiring America, a member of the Power Forward Coalition, laid off 28% of its workforce. “We are facing purposeful volatility designed to prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and from delivering lower energy costs and cheaper electricity to millions of American households across the country,” wrote the group’s Ari Matusiak in a post announcing the news.

Burning bridges

Other parts of the landmark IRA, a comprehensive law aimed at reshoring critical clean industries and supply chains, are facing their own threats. Energy Department officials are expected this week to “de-obligate” loans and guarantees to seven projects that had been offered conditional commitments by the agency’s Loan Programs Office, former DOE Loan Programs Office Jigar Shah said in an email.

The Biden administration boosted the LPO’s loan authority to $400 billion to help build “a bridge to bankability” for promising cleantech startups. Under Shah, former DOE Loan Programs Office chief, LPO committed more than $107 billion to 53 projects. Some $60 billion of those loans and guarantees were concluded; another $46.95 billion were still pending conditional milestones.

The conditional loans, said Shah, are intended to “signal to equity investors that the project can meet a ‘reasonable prospect of repayment.’” That, of course, assumes a stable policy environment — a quaint notion as House Republicans drafting a budget bill have take an ax to the IRA’s tax incentives, phasing out or eliminating provisions that cleantech companies and their investors had baked into their models.

“The House reconciliation bill has effectively repealed the Inflation Reduction Act and has caused these equity investors to think twice about investing in America,” said Shah. The bill, he said, would undercut nuclear power, critical minerals, geothermal and other energy sectors that the Trump administration claims to support. “When we lose the trust of equity investors, our loan applicants have no choice but to move away from commercializing their technologies in America or cancel their projects outright.”

The budget bill failed to pass a committee vote over the weekend. Although some Republicans support the IRA tax incentives, which have lured factories and jobs to their districts, the bill was torpedoed by hardliners pushing even more stringent IRA cuts.",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_1270641352.jpeg,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:59.767512

For those two chemicals, public water systems across the country will now have an additional two years to comply with the MCLs. In its announcement, EPA previewed the following anticipated actions related to the regulation of PFAS in drinking water:

As noted above, the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, two of the PFAS substances most regulated to date, will remain in place at 4 parts per trillion, although public water systems will now have an additional two years (until 2031, rather than 2029) to comply with these MCLs.

The MCLs for four other PFAS — PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX) — along with the Hazard Index for combinations of these substances will be rescinded and possibly reconsidered.

The agency is establishing a new technical assistance and outreach initiative for public water systems (in addition to continuing to offer the water technical assistance (WaterTA) service). EPA states that the new initiative, known as the PFAS OUTreach Initiative, or PFAS OUT, will prioritize outreach to public water systems in need of capital improvements to address PFAS impacts and will connect those utilities with ""resources, tools, funding, and technical assistance"" to position them to achieve compliance with the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS by the new deadline.

The agency hinted at ""holding polluters accountable"" and prioritizing enforcement against industrial sources of PFAS contaminating public water supplies, noting that ""the need for a polluter pays model has guided a lot of the work to be done at EPA in the future.""

The South and Central America region meanwhile saw 489MW/2,157MWh, primarily driven by projects in Chile. April saw developer Grenergy and investor CountourGlobal bring online the second phase of Grenergy’s huge Oasis de Atacama solar-plus-storage project while independent power producer (IPP) Atlas Renewable Energy commissioned its BESS Del Desierto project.

The Oceania region (in Rho Motion’s data) also had its best month of 2025, deploying 494MW/1,097MWh, primarily in Australia, including the Cunderdin solar-plus-storage project with a 55MW/220MWh BESS.

North America saw 611MW/1,621MWh come online, having seen three times that amount in March.

Europe saw 224MW/421MWh of new capacity enter operations in April.

Rho Motion said that 42GWh of BESS has been deployed in the first four months of the year, up 62% year-on-year. A total planned capacity for the full-year has grown to 440GWh, but project delays and even cancellations in light of US-China tariff uncertainty is likely to bring this number down, according to the firm.

Though Republican support for wind energy has dropped a bit in recent years, it remains above 50%.
In Virginia, Republican leaders have been among the biggest boosters of offshore wind for more than 15 years.
Legislators from both parties supported the creation of the Virginia Offshore Wind Development Authority.
We can’t afford to lose four years of offshore wind progress for no better reason than that Trump wills it.","On May 5, attorneys general from 17 states and the District of Columbia — not including Virginia, regrettably — sued the Trump administration over its attacks on the wind industry. The lawsuit challenges an executive order, signed by President Donald J. Trump on his first day in office, stopping all approvals, permits and funding for wind projects across the country and offshore.

Since the order was signed, the administration hasn’t just blocked new projects, it’s issued a stop-work order for one project under construction in New York and revoked a permit for another. The actions inflict enormous damage on the wind industry and on the economies of states that need the energy and jobs this industry could deliver.

One state that will lose big under Trump’s order is Virginia, which has positioned itself to be a national leader in offshore wind deployment, supply chain and manufacturing. On top of that, Virginia badly needs the electricity from offshore wind to help meet the demand from data centers; it can’t afford to have a major new source of energy strangled in its infancy. Yet Attorney General Jason Miyares did not join the lawsuit.

Will special rate classes protect Va. residents from the costs of serving data centers?

Sure, Miyares wants to be a good soldier in the Trump putsch. And no doubt he wouldn’t feel at home among all those Democratic AGs (there were no Republicans signing the complaint). But he could at least speak up in his state’s interest. Some well-timed advocacy would go a long way in showing the administration that wind energy is not a partisan matter.

It doesn’t have to be just our attorney general, either. The silence from Gov. Glen Youngkin has been equally deafening. What are they afraid of? Youngkin can’t run for reelection, and Miyares has already secured his party’s nomination in his bid for reelection this fall.

Youngkin vetoes clean energy bills supported by Dominion, environmental groups

Any politician who styles himself as pro-business ought to be pushing back on the Trump administration’s interference with contracts, destruction of American jobs and infliction of billions of dollars in damage to a growing domestic industry. Especially when it is happening to their own state, the big risk is in not speaking out.

And let’s face it, attacking wind energy is Trump’s own peculiar hobbyhorse, not his party’s. Though Republican support for wind energy has dropped a bit in recent years, it remains above 50%. Onshore wind is the largest source of electricity in Iowa and South Dakota and a major source in several other Republican strongholds. Wind power is responsible for billions of dollars in economic investment while keeping utility rates low in states that rely on it.

Offshore wind is more expensive, but states have embraced it for its potential to lower electricity bills over time while relieving grid congestion, creating well-paying jobs and providing clean, zero-carbon power to East Coast cities. Thirteen states have established offshore wind development goals, totaling over 112 gigawatts (GW) by 2050.

In Virginia, Republican leaders have been among the biggest boosters of offshore wind for more than 15 years. Legislators from both parties supported the creation of the Virginia Offshore Wind Development Authority. With a boost from then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, the Virginia Department of Energy partnered with Dominion Energy on a research project that produced the nation’s first offshore wind turbines in federal waters. Republican support also paved the way for Dominion’s development of the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, now more than halfway to completion and expected to begin delivering electricity next year.

Nor is CVOW a one-off; the Virginia Clean Economy Act declares twice as much offshore wind power to be “in the public interest.” At the offshore wind International Partnering Forum held in Virginia Beach last month, Dominion displayed a poster of the projects it has in the works. These include a project off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, which Dominion acquired last October, as well as a huge lease area east of CVOW, which Dominion secured in a lease auction from the federal government last August. All told, Dominion’s projects could deliver a total of 9 GW of clean, renewable power.

As important as the energy itself is, Virginia leaders believe offshore wind can be a driver of economic development and job creation for the Hampton Roads area. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership touts Virginia’s strategic location, strong maritime industry and ready workforce as draws for businesses up and down the offshore wind supply chain.

Some businesses have already set up shop in Virginia to serve the industry. These include most recently a Korean subsea cable manufacturer that is investing almost $700 million for a facility in Chesapeake. Gov. Glen Youngkin was on hand for the groundbreaking last month, calling it “a proud moment for Virginia.” Attracting the company was only possible because of Virginia’s commitment to the wind industry – as well as the availability of federal tax credits that Trump also intends to eliminate.

CVOW will likely survive Trump’s attacks (albeit at a higher cost due to his tariffs), but Virginia’s ability to develop an offshore wind workforce and supply chain are very much at risk. The Trump administration’s war on wind power already threatens developers with losses in the billions of dollars. With permitting at a halt, companies are headed for the exits instead of creating the project pipeline necessary for offshore wind to become the powerhouse industry that it is in Europe and Asia.

Trump may have planned his economic sabotage to hurt northeastern states with Democratic governors, but the collateral damage to Virginia is considerable. As it is, our economy has taken a hit from Trump’s mass firings of federal workers, thousands of whom live here. We can’t afford to lose four years of offshore wind progress for no better reason than that Trump wills it.

These will keep critical momentum going in communities already benefiting from Brownfields investments, ensuring continued progress toward safe and reusable land.

“In Camden NJ, our commitment to brownfield redevelopment not only cleans up our environment but also revitalizes local neighborhoods, instilling pride among residents,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By transforming these spaces, we create economic opportunities and foster community resilience.”

The Camden Redevelopment Agency in New Jersey has been selected to receive $650,000 for its Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding is provided in addition to the $5,324,999 already awarded and recognizes the RLF program’s high performance despite significantly depleted funds.

Camden’s RLF program has successfully facilitated loans or subgrants for 11 cleanup projects that are either completed or in progress. Notable projects for the use of the new funding include Elijah Perry Park, the Knox Gelatin property, Judge Johnson Park, and the former West Jersey Paper Manufacturing site.

“This funding will allow the Camden Redevelopment Agency to continue its vital efforts to assess, safely clean up, and sustainably reuse land that has long suffered from the effects of harmful environmental contaminants,” said Senator Cory Booker. “I look forward to continuing to partner with the EPA and local organizations to ensure we continue to fund brownfield development that converts land from liabilities into productive local assets.”

“Because of these funds, kids will have cleaner parks and outdoor spaces to play, and those who live in Camden will be able to have a better quality of life overall,” said Senator Andy Kim. “These hazardous chemicals have been polluting Camden County for far too long, and I’ll be tracking the progress of these clean ups to be certain these communities see their completion.”

“I voted to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create jobs, bolster public health outcomes, and improve the quality of life for residents in South Jersey,” said U.S. Representative Donald Norcross (NJ-01). “Brownfield Grants have been transformational across our region and especially in Camden City. Protecting our communities from harmful waste and repurposing these sites into valuable community assets for our neighborhoods has been a top priority for me. In Congress, I will continue to fight alongside local organizations to ensure the health and safety of South Jersey families.”

Brownfields grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities in New Jersey have used previous EPA grants to assess, cleanup, and attract new development. Nationally, Brownfields funding delivers proven results:

13.9 jobs per $100,000 of EPA Brownfield Grant funds spent

$20.45 for each $1 of EPA Brownfields funding expended on assessment, cleanup, and revolving loan fund grants.

Property values near cleaned-up sites increase by 5-15.2% with an estimated gain of $500,000 to $1.5 million in total property values

Increase of $29-97 million in local tax revenue in just the first year post-cleanup, per a study done in 2017.

The Supreme Court last Friday (May 16, 2025) said the right to live in a pollution free atmosphere was a part of the fundamental right as it struck down the Centre’s office memorandum allowing ex post facto or retrospective environmental clearances to projects in violation of norms.

A Bench comprising Justices Abhay S. Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan made scathing remarks in its judgement delivered on a plea filed by Vanashakti organisation and said, “The Union Government, as much as individual citizens, has a constitutional obligation to protect the environment.”

Former Environment Minister Mr. Ramesh hailed the judgement which he claimed was a “damning indictment” of the Modi government.

“In a landmark decision reaffirming the principles and practices of sustainable development, the Hon’ble Supreme Court on May 16, 2025 struck down the Modi Government’s measures enabling the grant of ex-post facto environmental clearances. It declared such clearances illogical and illegal,” Mr. Ramesh said.

The Supreme Court held that the 2017 notification issued by the Modi government had the sole purpose of shielding violators who knowingly did not secure the mandatory requirement of prior environmental clearance under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, he said.

“It further ruled that the 2017 Notification and the 2021 Office Memorandum jointly violated binding precedents, encouraged polluters, and legitimised the degradation of air and water quality—blatantly infringing upon the fundamental right to a clean environment guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,” Mr. Ramesh said.

“Pre-emptively disallowing for all measures granting ex-post facto environmental clearance in any manner, the Supreme Court noted ‘it is not possible to understand why the Central Government made efforts to protect those who committed illegality by not obtaining prior EC in terms of the EIA notification’,” he said.

Mr. Ramesh claimed that the judgment is a ""damning indictment"" of the Modi government whose domestic walk is ""completely at variance"" with its global talk as far as environmental protection is concerned.

The court said it ""must come down very heavily"" on the Centre's attempt to do ""something which is completely prohibited under the law"".

It added, ""Cleverly, the words ex post facto have not been used, but without using those words, there is a provision to effectively grant ex post facto EC. The 2021 OM has been issued in violation of the decisions of this court….""

The Bench, therefore, declared the 2021 office memorandum (OM) and related circulars “arbitrary, illegal, and contrary to the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006"".

""The patch was not pretty,"" Lasch said, adding that affordable housing projects often have thin margins and require deeply discounted financing to work.
Using GGRF money to augment his organization's funding pipeline to build more housing was a model that Burns said he had hoped to scale.
He said the prospect of having the GGRF money withdrawn was daunting because New Orleans is ""already a financially constrained city.""
""What this GGRF money can do is to be that last dollar in, right?","President Donald Trump has dismantled federal agencies and slashed spending as he's pledged to ""gut the weaponized deep state.""

He has also vowed to ease the housing shortage across the nation. One promise may come at the expense of the other in the case of one agency's retrenchment.

In February, his administration sought to take back $20 billion awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency during Joe Biden's presidency to fund decarbonization projects around the country. The head of the EPA has justified the clawback attempt with unproven accusations that the grants were marred by ""programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse.""

As a result, tens of thousands of new apartments and houses that were expected to be financed with a portion of the EPA money are now in danger of not being built, nonprofit groups who were granted the funding say.

Climate United, a coalition that received roughly $7 billion of the money — known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — is suing the EPA along with other awardees over the withheld funding. The nonprofit estimates that about 30,000 single-family homes and another 30,000 apartment units were to be built with some of the funds that it and another group were set to administer.

""There's a significant part of the strategy focused on building not only new housing but new affordable and workforce housing,"" Beth Bafford, the CEO of Climate United, said.

There are varied estimates on how many new homes are needed in the US. Freddie Mac, a mortgage lending agency, calculated recently that the country is short about 3.7 million units.

While the tens of thousands of homes that might be built with money from the GGRF would be just a small contribution toward that huge need, the fund's proponents say the money would go to a particularly impactful segment of the market.

Bafford said that the focus of the GGRF money was on housing development projects in a part of the market with a lack of private sector financing options: affordable projects using energy-efficient systems and materials that are environmentally sustainable while helping mitigate utility costs for residents.

""We see massive gaps in the financial markets, and this program was built to address some of those gaps,"" Bafford said.

A spokesperson for Climate United said it had ""disbursed $25 million in loans and committed over $500 million in loans before the EPA terminated our grant agreement without warning.""

""Unlike the Biden-Haris administration, this EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars,"" an unnamed spokesperson from the EPA responded in an email.

The spokesperson said the GGRF's termination was ""based on substantial concerns"" over its ""integrity, the award process, and programmatic waste and abuse, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.""

Some developers are already feeling the impact

The impacts of the freeze have already been felt by some developers.

Megan Lasch, the chief executive of O-SDA Industries, a for-profit builder of affordable housing based in Austin, said the EPA's clawback attempt made her reshuffle a portion of the financing package she had been arranging for a 90-unit affordable apartment project her firm is developing in Fort Worth, Texas.

The roughly $37 million development involves renovating 801 West Shaw St., a historic building with 45 rental apartments, erecting an additional 45 units on land adjacent to the property, and building a pre-K facility.

Lasch said she had arranged to use some $3 million of GGRF money for the project from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a member of Power Forward Communities, a coalition that received $2 billion of the EPA money.

When the GGRF money was held up, Lasch said that she found a replacement loan but that the new funding is more costly, carrying a roughly 4.5% interest rate versus the GGRF loan's roughly 1% rate.

""The patch was not pretty,"" Lasch said, adding that affordable housing projects often have thin margins and require deeply discounted financing to work. ""There's going to be ultimately a lot of projects that will just go by the wayside because they're not able to come up with a patch.""

The 801 West Shaw St. building is set to offer rents that are affordable for residents who earn between 30% and 60% of the area's median income, Lasch said.

Damon Burns, the CEO of Finance New Orleans, a public trust that helps fund and develop affordable housing in its namesake city, said that his organization had been allocated $5 million from the Coalition for Green Capital, which received $5 billion of GGRF money from the EPA.

Finance New Orleans was seeking to use about $1 million of that $5 million it was to receive in combination with $1.5 million of other funds it holds to build six or seven new homes with net-zero emissions.

Using GGRF money to augment his organization's funding pipeline to build more housing was a model that Burns said he had hoped to scale.

He said the prospect of having the GGRF money withdrawn was daunting because New Orleans is ""already a financially constrained city.""

""There is a huge concern that the disinvestment of the federal government will have an impact on all of our communities,"" Burns said. ""It means less mortgages for homeowners. It means less capital for developers.""

A climate-focused financing initiative

The GGRF was created with $27 billion of federal funds from the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress passed in 2022. Some $20 billion of that amount was awarded to Climate United, Power Forward Communities, the Coalition for Green Capital, and other groups for various climate-focused financing initiatives. The remaining $7 billion went toward a federal program to fund residential solar energy installation projects.

In December, Project Veritas, a conservative media organization, published a video that showed a former EPA official suggesting that the agency, under Biden, had fast-tracked its award of the money in anticipation that the incoming Trump administration might seek to scuttle the program.

In the video, the official said: ""It truly feels like we're on the Titanic and we're throwing gold bars off the edge.""

Lee Zeldin, a former Long Island, New York, congressman whom Trump appointed as the head of the EPA in January, cited the video as evidence of misconduct in the allocation of the funds.

""One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars,"" Zeldin said in a video posted on his X account in February. ""The 'gold bars' were your tax dollars, and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden administration knew they were wasting it.""

Zeldin has ordered the termination of the GGRF.

In March, Climate United sued the EPA and Citibank, the financial intermediary for the $20 billion, in the federal district court in Washington, DC, over their refusal to release the money. Power Forward and the Coalition for Green Capital have joined the suit.

The EPA lost the initial argument for the case but has brought its complaint to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where it won a preliminary order in April to freeze the money as its appeal is being considered. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday.

'Every single project in the country is looking for gap funding'

While Climate United estimated that terminating the GGRF would put roughly 60,000 homes at risk, other parties involved in the financing program say that number could be even greater.

There has been a sharp increase in the number of housing developers interested in tapping financing from the GGRF, said Shaun Donovan, the president and CEO of the nonprofit housing lender Enterprise Community Partners. He was a secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration.

Donovan attributed that interest to growing construction costs from inflation and tariffs, which have driven up the price of building materials. Those overruns have punched holes in the budgets of a host of development projects that builders have scrambled to fill.

""Every single project in the country is looking for gap funding,"" Donovan said. ""What this GGRF money can do is to be that last dollar in, right? So even if it's only 5% or 10% of the project.""

A spokesperson for Enterprise said that it had received inquiries for about $1.2 billion of financing in recent months for a collection of projects totaling 18,426 units.

""My concern is that what this and other efforts to cut housing programs will do is make it impossible for the president to meet his goal of reducing housing costs,"" Donovan said.",https://i.insider.com/6827932968a2929008019797?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-05-19 06:00:33.377554

For those affected, the disruption brought not only inconvenience but real hardship, with the whole of civil society still grappling with the aftermath.

This isn’t a uniquely Iberian issue. In 2019, a lightning strike on the Hornsea One offshore wind farm in the UK triggered a cascading failure that left more than a million people without power and brought rail networks to a standstill.

Across geographies, energy infrastructure built for a different era remains all too vulnerable to disruption. Designed for the demands of the 20th century, our energy systems are no longer fit for the realities of the 21st. They remain too static and too slow to respond to sudden changes. The energy industry needs a fundamental shift, a move toward a resilient, digitalized and flexible energy system capable of adapting in real time.

To meet these challenges, we must invest in energy systems that are inherently resilient. Advances in artificial intelligence now make it possible to create self-healing grids: networks that can isolate faults, dynamically adjust, and continue to deliver power without interruption.

Moving away from a handful of large, fossil-fueled power plants – systems that could once be managed by a centralized command center and a few spreadsheets – towards a highly decentralized network of millions of renewable generation points and large-scale battery storage marks a fundamental shift. We also see the rise of consumer technologies like EVs that can store days of energy, and heat pumps that can vary their energy use without inconveniencing home owners. This transformation doesn’t just demand smarter coordination; it gives us the opportunity to build an energy system that is flexible, intelligent and capable of healing itself in real time. These distributed assets, when connected and coordinated intelligently with AI, can provide critical services to managing the grid, like energy balancing, voltage support, synthetic inertia, frequency regulation and congestion relief in milliseconds, delivering flexibility where it’s needed most.

Consumer-led technologies are accelerating this shift. In 2023, consumers spent twice as much on low-carbon technologies – EVs, home solar, batteries and heat pumps – as governments did. This marks a new era in which consumers are active participants in energy resilience. Each electric vehicle, for instance, is not just transport – it’s a potential battery for the grid, able to power a home for four or five days.

By 2030, an estimated 20.9 million EVs will be on American roads by 2030 (at minimum). Coordinated effectively, these vehicles will be able to offer another layer of defence against outages. Combined with large-scale batteries and smart grid infrastructure, we have the tools to design an energy system that can adapt, absorb shocks and recover – quickly and automatically.

Recent interconnector failures have shown the power of self-healing energy systems in action. In October 2024 and March 2025, trips on the North Sea Link (NSL) with Norway and Interconnexion France-Angleterre 2 (IFA2) with France cut up to 1.4GW of imports to Britain, causing sharp drops in generation leading to imbalance of supply and demand, like the one in Iberia (see graphs below). But this time, fast-acting frequency services from battery sites run on modern software helped stabilize the grid immediately before it led to blackouts. These assets absorbed the shock in real time, while consumer devices were able to shift demand and avoid outages while the system recovered.

NSL (UK- Norway Interconnector) trip reduced exports to the UK from 1.4GW to 0.

IFA2 (UK- France Interconnector) tripped, reducing imports to the UK by ~1GW.

A reliable energy system is the foundation of a functioning society. It powers hospitals, transports people and goods and keeps communications running. The consequences of even brief outages are real – and growing. But we are not powerless in the face of these risks. We have the technology, the infrastructure and the momentum to build something stronger.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/st7Y6A7Q_FOx64fYhAg6fIi0mYKPhE9TVixmozW6-ms/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9wZXhlbHMtZWNsaXBzZS1jaGFzZXJzLTcxNjcxOTk4NC0zMTI3NzAzOF9wcm9jZXNzZWQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:03.167550

Energy security remains a cornerstone of the U.S.-India partnership, being vital for economic growth and national security. A U.S.-India Energy and Industrial Partnership should involve deploying energy technologies at scale, reducing concentrations in energy supply chains and manufacturing, and strengthening both the domestic industrial base and industrial corridor between the two countries. This will require a four-pronged approach involving: research partnerships to leapfrog to new battery chemistries and small modular reactors, among other emerging technologies; trade missions and technology transfers in strategic sectors, including automotive and battery technologies; public-private partnerships in areas such as lithium-ion battery and ancillary component manufacturing; and a bilateral track involving governments and financial institutions for funding strategic sectors.

The United States and India can expect an eight-to-tenfold increase in demand for batteries and critical minerals (such as nickel, copper, lithium, and graphite) by 2035. Addressing this demand will require joint resource mapping, capital deployment, and manufacturing and technology partnerships. Particular efforts must also be made on automotive and transportation technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells, advanced driving assistance, and drones. Furthermore, India’s expansion of natural gas, green hydrogen, and nuclear power in its energy mix present opportunities for collaboration, with advantages for the United States in cost-competitive electrolyzers and nuclear energy components. All of these steps will present opportunities for collaboration and investments involving the private sector and the two countries’ start-up ecosystems.

Introduction

India and the United States have strengthened their bilateral cooperation in the past two decades, built on the foundation of shared values and interests of security, economic prosperity, trade, and investment. The two countries reaffirmed their commitment to bilateral cooperation, launching the U.S.–India COMPACT for the 21st Century, emphasizing energy security, critical emerging technologies, and trade enhancements, in a joint statement during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington in February 2025. Recent initiatives have included cooperation on power and energy efficiency, responsible oil and gas, including hydrogen and biofuels, batteries, the inclusion of India in the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), INDUS-Innovation, the initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), and more recently the U.S.–India TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology) which cut across strategic sectors including defense and aerospace. 2025–26 will remain a crucial period to maintain and expand on the bilateral efforts, building on the shared goals of industrial policy and energy security.

The United States and India have recently expressed intent to increase bilateral trade volumes to $500 billion by 2030, requiring double-digit growth in the next five years. Following this announcement, both countries have taken steps to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement. Bilateral trade was estimated to be around $129.2 billion in 2024, registering a robust 9.5 percent compounded annual growth rate since 2016. Since 2016, India has seen increasing energy trade with the United States, primarily imports, peaking at $14.7 billion in 2022, forming 28 percent of total Indian imports from the United States.

Energy security has been considered a cornerstone for economic growth and crucial for national security. Interestingly, both countries have seen 35–40 percent reduction in energy intensity economy-wide between 2000–2022 and had a similar share of renewables in power generation of about 22 percent (as of 2022). In terms of final energy consumption, about 54.4 percent comes from coal, oil, and natural gas in India, whereas the same constitutes about 72.2 percent in the United States. India remains a net energy importer (approximately 36 percent of its total energy supply) compared to the United States who is a net energy exporter (approximately 8 percent of its total energy production).

Observer Research Foundation America (ORF America) hosted a series of closed-door, invitation-only workshops with Indian and American energy and climate experts to better understand actionable opportunities for the United States to cooperate with India. Following the 2024 Indian and U.S. elections, ORF America closely tracked policy developments and changes in the strategic priorities of the newly elected governments. This special report builds on the outcomes from the workshops, recent policy announcements, and recommends a proposal for a U.S.-India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership. This partnership could leverage respective strengths and the bilateral relationship to meet the following objectives: 1) develop and deploy energy technologies at scale at home and abroad; 2) reduce concentration in energy supply chains and manufacturing of new energy technologies of the future; and 3) continue to strengthen both the domestic industrial base and the industrial corridor between the two countries.

Reducing Concentration and Increasing Commercialization in Technology and Energy Supply Chains

With the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States already has about 72 gigawatt hours (GWh) of lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity as of 2024, and over 36,000 tons (as of 2023) of battery recycling capacity domestically attracting some of the world’s largest investments. India is currently building capacity for over 60 GWh of battery manufacturing that is expected to be operational in phases from 2027 onwards. By 2035, estimates suggest that demand for batteries would be around 1000–1200 GWh and 160–380 GWh in the United States and India, respectively. The rapid growth in energy technologies has put the spotlight on battery supply chains including the availability of critical raw materials.

Global demand for critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, copper, graphite, and rare earths is expected to double by 2035 from 2024 levels in a business-as-usual scenario, with demand increasing by a factor of 3 to 5 times, in an accelerated global energy transition pathway. In this context, lithium demand for India and the United States battery market is expected to increase 8 times by 2035, from 2024 levels. Minerals such as nickel, copper, and graphite also have over half of their demand coming from base industrial sectors including infrastructure and steel, forming a strong foundational base to economic growth. Both the United States and India are net importers of critical minerals. The global landscape on critical minerals, while rooted in the context of energy transition technologies and manufacturing, has expanded to include other strategic sectors such as defense, aerospace, and high-value electronics, including semiconductors, further highlighting the importance of critical minerals as dual-use inputs.

A two-pronged strategy will be needed to secure the necessary raw materials from global markets for short- and medium-term demand in the next 5–10 years, while they continue to develop potential domestic resources that can cater to long-term supply, even under accelerated permitting timelines. During the deliberations, experts framed the emergence and vitality of critical minerals as integral to a new industrial revolution. In this context, it is crucial to highlight four areas: resource mapping, processing and refining, technology development, and recycling. Both the United States and India have critical mineral strategies, with India announcing its National Critical Minerals Mission (NCMM) in February 2025, with many overlapping objectives, including accelerating domestic mineral exploration projects and recycling.

Participants from the U.S. government emphasized that India is among the only credible partners that can help break China’s dominance in clean energy manufacturing and strategic industries, including batteries, electrolyzers, and solar cells, as well as intermediary inputs such as refined or processed materials. Participants from both countries agreed that prioritizing diversification from China should be a key bilateral effort, in addition to strengthening bilateral cooperation. Participants at the New Delhi workshop, while echoing similar sentiments, emphasized that the bilateral partnership should also identify next-generation technologies that create a comparative advantage, an objective that aligns with the earlier bilateral iCET program and the newly announced U.S.–India TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology) initiative. The newly announced research partnership between the Anusandhan National Research Foundation in India and the United States National Science Foundation can play a strategic role in advancing joint research and development (R&D) projects.

In terms of specific minerals for further bilateral attention, the Washington workshop highlighted that both the United States and India had import dependency across the mineral value chain. One such example is graphite, which was highlighted as a viable option to expand U.S.–India critical minerals trade. One expert pointed out that as of 2023, the United States sourced 48 percent of its graphite imports from China at a higher cost than India’s graphite export price. Materials such as graphite are used across sectors ranging from steel to consumer goods to batteries, and thus, even if India-sourced graphite can supply to non-clean technology sectors (given its ore quality) in the United States, it can relieve part of the commodity price pressure. A strategy of identifying mineral dependencies and an economy-wide approach of sourcing diversification can be beneficial for both countries. Experts at the United States workshop also highlighted that of the twelve strategic defense minerals for the United States, ten of them overlap with India’s priorities as well, while overall, nineteen minerals overlap across the critical mineral lists of the two countries.

While the development of upstream mineral extraction projects can have a longer gestation period, developing critical minerals refining capabilities can be achieved relatively faster in both countries. The Washington workshop participants expressed that the bilateral partnership could also evaluate the possibility of developing joint refining bases in Southeast Asia and Africa, beyond their own respective domestic capacities. However, India-sourced or Indian-company extracted and processed minerals are not currently Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) compliant, which calls for a bilateral critical minerals agreement that could make India an operationally compliant strategic partner.

In both the New Delhi and Washington workshops, participants discussed industrial policy efforts in the two countries, highlighting the focus on onshoring manufacturing through various policy measures requiring higher domestic content requirements. However, both countries will have to rely on international cooperation to ensure that they remain competitive and have market access while participating in global supply chains. Despite certain trade and economic tensions, the United States and India have comparative advantages that present an opportunity to create a critical minerals industrial corridor, mainly due to viable costs of capital and labor in India, and advanced scientific capabilities in both countries. Further, efforts such as the Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative by the U.S. EXIM Bank, providing targeted financing to develop critical mineral projects from trusted partners, could be leveraged by India.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Strategic and Critical Materials Board, which will comprise members from other departments, including Energy, State, Commerce, and Interior, to ensure secure and resilient access to materials and minerals and to identify innovative solutions for complex industrial base challenges. For a successful partnership, India would also need to consider its institutional framework on critical minerals to ensure effective engagement and implementation.

While both countries focus on the development of domestic industrial bases that can cut across the value chain to improve their competitiveness, five key areas of bilateral cooperation emerge on critical minerals and supply chains:

Advancing resource mapping through collaboration between the United States Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of India

Joint deployment of capital in mineral assets and refining facilities in domestic and international markets

Technology partnerships for battery manufacturing and recycling, building on the Strategic Mineral Recovery Initiative

International cooperation through multilateral platforms, including the MSP and Quad, to ensure supply chain diversification

Joint track and trace approaches to identify areas of vulnerabilities, investment opportunities, and technology development.

Expanding Ties In the Automotive Industry and Technology Development

The United States and India are major automotive hubs and the world’s second and third largest markets, respectively. Technology advancements will be key to maintaining the global competitiveness of the automotive sector in both countries. This makes the automotive sector between the two countries an important potential sector of cooperation, and should be part of the ongoing trade discussions.

In the past, major U.S. automakers such as Ford, General Motors, and Navistar have had strategic investments in the India market, while Indian companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Tata Sons have been making inroads in the United States, with the former having its North America Technical Center headquartered in Michigan.

Beyond vehicle manufacturing, automotive components trade has been robust between the two countries. While 27 percent of India’s total automotive component exports are to the United States (as of 2024), India remains the 9th largest trading partner in this sector with the United States. While around half of the component imports to the United States come from Mexico and Canada, India remains a key player in the Mexican automotive industry, with 6 percent of component exports from India, as well as most major Indian component manufacturers having factories in Mexico, thereby indirectly catering to the U.S. automotive market.

Further, both markets are expected to continue witnessing electric vehicle (EV) sales, strengthening opportunities for technology cooperation and investments in EVs, EV components, and electronics. The United States has built a strong capability around high-voltage EV powertrains since 2021, while India has shown its capabilities in innovation and cost optimization. Infrastructure development for EV charging also remains a key area for cooperation, with the United States already implementing advanced policies.

Recent bilateral cooperation in road transportation has been largely around electric mobility, through technical assistance driving EV adoption, deployment of electric transit buses, and assessing the investment landscape to facilitate capital flow in the e-mobility sector. For the next phase of e-mobility deployment, United States workshop participants looked to the trucking sector, where various global logistics players are transitioning their truck fleets in both countries, with automotive original equipment manufacturers making significant investments in electric, fuel cell, and hydrogen-internal combustion engine (ICE) technologies.

As sub-national governments in the United States continue to deploy electric and low-emission buses for transit and school buses, there is limited manufacturing capacity domestically, which provides an opportunity for Indian e-bus manufacturers to consider investments in the United States. The efforts of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), the state’s government investment promotion unit, to bring more Indian businesses to the state, including the automotive sector, is a good example.

United States workshop stakeholders agreed that ambitious industrial policies can and should be aligned to aid this pillar of cooperation around the automotive industry and technology development, including e-mobility, alternative fuels, hydrogen, and other new emerging technologies, to ensure that the respective sectors in both countries continue to remain globally competitive. This takes further significance, especially in the face of aggressive, cost-competitive Chinese automotive products, namely electric vehicle exports to global markets.

Based on the deliberations, key areas of cooperation include:

Expanding automotive manufacturing in both countries, including joint ventures, foreign direct investment (FDI) by the U.S. and Indian companies.

Technology access and development for advanced automotive technologies, including electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and hydrogen ICE powertrains for trucks, advanced driving assistance (ADAS) technologies, among others.

Expanding transportation cooperation to include aviation and shipping sectors, including sustainable aviation and marine fuels, drones, VTOL aircraft, etc.

Advancing Development in Emerging Fuels, Including Hydrogen and Nuclear Cooperation

As both countries consider energy security goals, certain shared priorities emerge: (i) ensuring affordable and reliable energy for end use sectors; (ii) advancing grid reliability and resiliency; and, (iii) increasing share of nuclear power in the mix. In India’s case, three key strategies in its energy security pathway include:

Expanding natural gas to 15 percent share of the energy mix from the current 6 percent

Domestic production of 5 million metric tons (MMT) of green hydrogen by 2030

100 gigawatts (GW) of installed nuclear power capacity by 2047 with focus on small modular reactors.

Natural gas will play a key role in India’s energy security pathway in the near future. As India looks to increase its share of natural gas, it will continue to rely on imports, which complements the U.S. policy on expanding liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. India’s natural gas demand saw a 10 percent annual increase in 2024, driven by rapid expansion of infrastructure, especially for residential and transportation sectors. Since 2019, the number of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations for transport have quadrupled, while the number of residential gas connections have more than doubled, with a push towards clean urban transportation and access to clean cooking fuels. By 2030, the number of CNG stations and residential connections will almost double including a 50 percent expansion in the gas transmission grid.

India’s energy imports from the United States have consistently increased since 2016, primarily driven by LNG, reaching a peak in 2022. India and the United States have reaffirmed their commitment towards increasing energy trade including natural gas and investments in infrastructure involving private sector in both countries. With India’s increasing push for gas infrastructure and demand potential, the United States could emerge as a strategic energy supplier for India, with long term security of both the resource as well as in terms of prices.

Natural gas takes further significance for India as it looks to scale hydrogen production. Beyond India’s 5 MMT target of green hydrogen production by 2030, it also aims to become an exporter of green hydrogen. Hydrogen demand is steadily increasing in various sectors including industries, ports, steel manufacturing, and transportation, especially the marine and aviation sectors. However, hydrogen is still a nascent industry and has challenges including high costs to the end user and a lack of sufficient infrastructure.

Experts agreed that efficient production, distribution networks, and global markets must be leveraged to incorporate hydrogen technologies at scale. Experts agreed that leveraging low-cost clean energy in both the United States and India can help reduce the delivered cost of electricity in the production cycle. Moving hydrogen production closer to consumption areas is another solution to reduce costs, and a clear short-term strategy. Hydrogen for transportation remains uncertain due to lower costs of battery electric and conventional ICE vehicles, and existing unreliability in hydrogen infrastructure.

The United States currently has an annual hydrogen production capacity of about 10 MMT, most of it currently being grey hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas, using steam methane reforming. This emits around 3–5 kg CO₂e per kilogram (kg) of hydrogen produced, compared to the green hydrogen threshold of less than 1 kg CO₂e. In the case of India, the definition of green hydrogen is set at no more 2 kg of CO₂e per kilogram of hydrogen produced. These thresholds are important as they bring forth a clear understanding of the potential for hydrogen cooperation between the two countries. As India looks to scale up hydrogen deployment, a cost-effective pathway will include a mix of grey and green hydrogen in the near to medium term. With India’s relatively less stringent green hydrogen thresholds, the role of natural gas-based hydrogen production would be significant, increasing demand for natural gas. This offers a unique convergence of cooperation on both natural gas and hydrogen, between the two countries.

Prior to 2025, the two countries have been collaborating under the Renewable Energy Technology Action Platform (RETAP), to achieve their respective goals of reducing the cost of green hydrogen. Going forward, rather than integrating hydrogen across sectors, experts emphasized that its implementation should focus on select industries such as steel, ammonia, and fertilizers. For instance, Indian steel manufacturers are actively exploring green steel production to stay competitive and carbon-compliant in global markets, especially with the announcement of the green steel taxonomy by India’s Ministry of Steel. Electrolyzer costs are significantly cheaper in India than in the United States, and one expert argued that the existing United States and India partnership should be explored to expand its manufacturing in both countries. Long-term electricity grid storage is another viable use case for hydrogen, although its demand will not arise for another decade. Hydrogen is an important piece in the global fuels narrative, with significant investments from the oil and gas industry, but it is imperative to continue focus on its research and development before scaled implementation across sectors.

Nuclear power has been relatively stagnant in India at about 1.2 percent of its total energy supply, compared to 9.8 percent in the United States. India announced an ambitious Nuclear Energy Mission in February 2025, with the goal of achieving 100 GW of installed nuclear power capacity by 2047, with a focus on research and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The United States has always focused on nuclear energy as a key part of its energy security strategy, launching the Advanced SMR R&D Program in 2019. After a long gap, this opens a strategic opportunity for U.S.–India cooperation on nuclear energy, including private sector investment and technology licensing from American companies to India, which has also been emphasized in the U.S–India joint statement in February 2025. Building on the previous U.S.–India iCET program and the new TRUST initiative, a specific avenue of civil nuclear cooperation will be critical. This will enable the two countries to realize the full potential of the 2005 Civil Nuclear Agreement, including specific measures such as amendments to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act 2010 by India and the removal of restrictions on Indian nuclear entities and technology exports by the United States. The regulatory clearance approved by the U.S. Department of Energy to Holtec International, a U.S. firm, to transfer SMR technology to India in March 2025 is a significant step in that direction.

Based on the deliberations, key findings include:

Scaling hydrogen deployment through a combination of grey and green hydrogen to manage costs including prioritizing end-use sectors such as steel, ammonia, and fertilizer.

Leveraging cost competitive electrolyzer manufacturing in India to expand manufacturing in both countries.

Advancing a renewed strategic opportunity for U.S.–India cooperation on nuclear energy, including private sector investment and technology licensing from American companies to India.

With India’s increasing push for gas infrastructure and demand potential, the United States could emerge as a strategic energy supplier for India, with long term security of both the resource as well as in terms of prices.

Delivering Finance by Spurring Private Sector Investment

Emerging markets have the greatest economic growth potential and, with stable economic principles, offer an attractive home for capital investment. India remains among the most attractive markets for investment potential, with a robust gross domestic product growth of 5–7 percent annually, attracting over $1 trillion cumulatively in FDI since 2000. India ranks 39th in the Global Innovation Index 2024, rising from 80th in 2015 and 40th in the World Competitive Index 2024. These factors, coupled with India’s growing skilled workforce, large consumer market, and strong macroeconomic principles make it a strong investment destination.

In the period from 2000–2024, FDI from the United States to India totaled about $69 billion, being a leading market for American firms in areas such as e-commerce, aviation, railways, telecommunications, food processing, and heavy equipment.

India’s commitment to clean energy transitions brings with it a market potential of $1.1 trillion. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India’s financing requirements to meet its energy transition goals of 2030 and 2070 is a staggering $160 billion per year. Recent initiatives announced during state visits, the G20, Quad (India, United States, Japan, Australia) summits, Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), and at other forums, have been positive indicators of finance and investments continuing to remain a high priority for bilateral and multilateral cooperation.

United States workshop participants noted several avenues being pursued by the U.S. government to deploy capital towards India’s energy transition, particularly through the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC). India is currently the largest market for DFC at 10 percent with $4.3 billion exposure, with the aim of capitalizing on clean energy transition, transportation, and job creation. Of this, $1.6 billion is dedicated to clean energy projects.

In particular, the DFC’s financial instruments include guarantees and support mechanisms to attract private sector investment in sectors that are usually not bankable, i.e., real or perceived risk is too high for the private sector to invest. A combination of policy and financing mechanisms has resulted in significant success stories for electric buses and solar photovoltaic manufacturing. These success stories offer important lessons that can and should be applied to other sectors and technologies such as batteries, alternative fuels, efficient cooling, and supply chains. For example, managing cooling demand in India through efficient technologies and software is one way to manage surging power demand in the country.

While Washington workshop participants discussed efforts through DFC as a bright spot, New Delhi participants offered a more measured assessment of current bilateral and multilateral efforts. Indian participants agreed that India’s finance needs for its energy transition are in orders of magnitude larger than other developing countries. No one country, government, or institution will be the source of all this financing, so efforts from development finance institutions like the DFC and multilateral development banks like the World Bank by themselves will not be sufficient but can play a key role in derisking the inflow of private capital. Consequently, external private sector funding and foreign direct investment must be mobilized in the strategic sectors, especially as domestic capital inflows in India are not sustainable.

Bilateral or multilateral finance efforts must account for India’s size and complexity, including Indian federalism and sub-national engagement. For example, Indian participants suggested both governments explore partnerships to secure social protection funding for coal-dependent regions, especially as renewable energy in India gets cheaper, it will phase out non-renewable sources of energy such as coal plants. Moreover, another area to grow cooperation is engagement with state-owned enterprises in India, which span sectors beyond privately developed renewables and drive much of the energy transition in the country, including minerals, natural gas, hydrocarbons, nuclear, among others. In terms of target sectors for investment, New Delhi workshop participants also noted that Indian solar and e-mobility sectors are relatively mature. They stressed that new investments from international public funds should be redirected into sectors like grid scale energy storage, offshore wind, and green hydrogen that need more public sector support to encourage private investment.

In the context of clean energy manufacturing, investment, and innovation, the Washington workshop participants agreed that the United States must evaluate developments in the Indian private sector in tandem with governmental efforts. Along with the rise of global Indian companies, its start-up ecosystem is making strides in industries including critical minerals processing, battery manufacturing, hydrogen production, and e-mobility. On the other hand, India has used its Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) schemes to drive strategic private investment in sectors like battery manufacturing, electronics and components, and solar, among others, attracting close to $19 billion worth of investments between 2021–2024. Stakeholders agreed that it has had a significant impact in kickstarting the transition to create an enabling environment to increase private sector investment.

Both countries must therefore create channels for the private sector to address their impediments and concerns. The International Trade Administration (ITA) has been taking steps to address such concerns and deepen the U.S.–India commercial partnership. A key ITA focus area is clean energy supply chains, particularly solar energy. Improving the traceability of India–U.S. solar supply chains is imperative to reduce dependence on Chinese solar exports. Collective action through multilateral efforts, including Australia and Brazil, are necessary to address high-risk upstream issues in the solar value chain. Similar opportunities exist in critical minerals and battery supply chains. With the new TRUST initiative, strategic sectors such as defense and aerospace also offer significant market opportunities for private sector investment and have the potential to accelerate the development and deployment of critical future technologies.

Key findings of the workshops include:

Expanding financing opportunities beyond global Indian industries to include the start-up ecosystem which is making strides in critical and emerging energy technologies.

Exploring a U.S.–India investment vehicle expanding the Production-Linked Incentives (PLI’s) scheme to create a finance multiplier effect for critical and emerging energy technologies.

Improve the traceability of India–U.S. supply chains to reduce dependency and vulnerabilities.

The Path Forward: A U.S.–India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership

Drawing on the workshop outcomes, it is clear that the United States and India are best positioned to leverage their respective strengths and their bilateral relationship to: 1) develop and deploy energy technologies at scale at home and abroad; 2) reduce concentration in energy supply chains and manufacturing of new energy technologies of the future; and 3) continue to strengthen the both the domestic industrial base and the industrial corridor between the two countries.

To mutually strengthen strategic objectives, increase private sector investments, and capture economic opportunities, the United States and India should launch a U.S.–India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership that builds upon 20+ years of successful bilateral cooperation. This initiative should prioritize three key areas: (i) accelerate commercialization of strategic technologies and battery supply chains; (ii) expand automotive technology cooperation and investment; (iii) advance development of emerging fuels including hydrogen and nuclear.

For a long-term and successful partnership, industrial policy, technology development, and global competitiveness remain at the center, and achieving these concurrent objectives will require a four-pronged approach:

Research, Development, and Innovation: the partnership should reorient current research partnerships to focus on next generation emerging and critical technologies including leapfrogging to new battery chemistries, future automotive technologies, hydrogen and nuclear SMR. Mirroring the recent U.S.–India Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), the launch of INDUS Innovation aims to advance industry–academia partnerships and foster investments for new and emerging sectors including space and energy.

Trade and Investment: U.S.–India two-way goods trade in the automotive sector totaled $3.8 billion and $600 million in the battery supply chain as of 2023. Bilateral trade and investment have the potential to reorient battery supply chains away from China and potentially meet U.S. domestic battery production deficits, as well as open opportunities for technology transfer from the United States to India. Specific efforts could include trade missions, feasibility assessments, and export guarantees to advance cooperation in the specific sectors identified. Further, specific provisions within the trade framework to enable technology transfer in strategic sectors as well as flow of specific critical minerals and advanced batteries, export and import of nuclear technologies, hydrogen fuel and electrolyzers, could go a long way in building a global diversified supply chain for both countries.

Public-Private Partnerships: Under the bilateral partnership, launching a specific U.S.–India batteries task force bringing together major American and Indian industry players along with both governments, trade groups and civil society, could serve to catalyze strategic partnerships and investments needed to realize the other three pillars. India could provide an alternative regional hub for lithium-ion battery and ancillary component manufacturing in the Indo-Pacific. Additionally, specific tracks on automotive industry cooperation, and alternative fuels (including hydrogen and nuclear) would strengthen bilateral cooperation, opening new market opportunities. In the context of such partnerships, leveraging existing institutional mechanisms between the two countries can help accelerate the timelines, leading to tangible outcomes in the near term.

Finance: Beyond leveraging financial instruments from U.S. DFC, U.S. Export-Import Bank and U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to crowd in private sector investment, the two countries can also setup a Finance for Strategic Sectors track, that brings together financial institutions and private investors in both countries periodically to clearly identify a pipeline of projects for potential investment prioritizing the sectors identified.

A U.S.–India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership has the potential to transform bilateral cooperation and grow private sector cooperation. Consequently, there is a need to break down past and existing U.S.–India partnerships and identify long-term goals and potential domestic measures that could hinder initiatives at an operational level. Partnerships need to account for these risks and vulnerabilities from both countries, and guard against them in the long-term scenario. Trust building is essential, and both countries need to take steps to ensure policy continuity and build towards a multi-dimensional long-term partnership that transcends short-term geopolitical tensions. Lastly, while domestic objectives around energy transitions may change, both countries will benefit from prioritizing industrial policy outcomes and global competitiveness, especially as global markets continue to focus on clean energy technologies and supply chains.

People who have been struggling to clean up decades of industrial pollution in the lower Cape Fear River basin are expressing their dismay and anger at a federal delay announced Wednesday on a crackdown on so-called forever chemicals that have fouled their drinking water.

That day, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to extend the timeline for water utilities to reduce the maximum safe levels for human consumption for a select group of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as PFAS.

In 2024, under the Biden Administration, the EPA finalized the first-ever enforceable standards for six PFAS compounds: PFOA, PFOS, HFPO-DA (GenX), PFBS, PFNA and PFHxS. At that time, water utilities had until 2029 to comply with the new standards.

A year later, the Trump Administration’s newly appointed EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would uphold standards set for PFOA and PFOS — legacy PFAS that persist in the environment despite no longer being manufactured. But Zeldin also announced he would rescind and re-evaluate rules for the other four, including GenX.

GenX is the common name for the substance produced at the Chemours Fayetteville Works plant; it was discharged into the river’s water for decades until researchers revealed their presence in 2017.

Additionally, the new federal timeline gives utilities until 2031 to comply with the standards, extending the original 2029 deadline.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” Zeldin said in a news release. “At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.”

While Zeldin’s statement appeared aimed at reassuring the public that the EPA is taking control of the situation, to critics, it sounded like a betrayal — signaling, in their view, a retreat from more robust protections from substances that have become known as “forever chemicals” because of their persistence in the environment.

‘Not forward-thinking’

“Overall, PFOA and PFOS are chemicals of the past, though they are still present in drinking water sources. So removing them will get a lot of others,” said N.C. State University epidemiologist Jane Hoppin in an email. “But the other four are chemicals of the future, particularly GenX, so removing these rules would not be forward-looking.”

In 2017, Hoppin headed a team of researchers and launched the GenX Exposure Study, which revealed that most of the people from the Cape Fear River Basin who participated in the research have PFAS in their blood.

There are thousands of unique PFAS in the environment, according to experts. They’re present in multiple products to help make them slippery and resistant to oils, water and solvents, including some cosmetics and apparel, microwave popcorn wrappers, dental floss, firefighting gear and some firefighting foams.

PFAS exposure is associated with a range of adverse health effects, such as increased cholesterol levels, kidney and testicular cancer, pre-eclampsia in pregnant women and decreased vaccine response in children, among other conditions.

“The EPA is caving to chemical industry lobbyists and pressure by the water utilities, and in doing so, it’s sentencing millions of Americans to drink contaminated water for years to come,” said Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook in a statement.

Cook’s organization has worked throughout the country to document environmental problems.

“The cost of PFAS pollution will fall on ordinary people, who will pay in the form of polluted water and more sickness, more suffering and more deaths from PFAS-related diseases,” he said.

Kelly Moser, senior attorney and leader of the Water Program at the Southern Environmental Law Center, echoed this sentiment. “When this administration talks about deregulation, this is what they mean — allowing toxic chemicals in drinking water at the request of polluters,” she said in a release.

Living with PFAS

It has been a tumultuous eight years for thousands of North Carolinians living in the Cape Fear River Basin since the presence of the forever chemicals was first announced in 2017. Among those affected are residents whose drinking water wells are contaminated, likely because of PFAS that were incinerated at the Fayetteville Works plant and drifted far and wide in emissions from the factory.

Despite a 2019 consent order — established among Chemours, Cape Fear River Watch and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality — aimed at assisting residents with PFAS-contaminated wells, living with PFAS is a daunting challenge.

Jamie White, administrator of the Facebook group “Grays Creek Residents United Against PFAS in our Wells and Rivers,” which works to raise awareness about PFAS contamination, expressed the group’s frustration after the EPA’s latest announcement.

“Well, it shocked us all, first off — and when I say all I speak for the group,” White said during a call with NC Health News. “Number one, we have worked for eight years to get the limits lowered, to bring awareness to everybody, because our wells are contaminated.”

“[The EPA] extended the public water facilities another two years [before] having to have the chemicals cleaned out of their water systems — another two years of contaminating the public,” she said.

Jane Jacobs (EagleHeart), a tribal leader of the Tuscarora Nation — an Indigenous community with many members in the Cape Fear River Basin — criticized the lack of action to protect vulnerable communities.

“My children, my grandchildren, need to be protected from all of the poison, not some of the poison,” Jacobs said. “If somebody was pointing a gun at my kid right now, am I going to protect him from one bullet or all of the bullets?”

Jacobs also highlighted the disproportionate impact on her community.

“Being a bipoc community, we face a lot more environmental hardships than most people do,” she stated. “We have to drink the tap water. We don’t have money for filters, so for the people in my community, this affects us 10 times worse because we don’t have the money to protect ourselves.”

Looking ahead

While many expressed disappointment over the EPA’s decision, the environmental community remains hopeful that more stringent rules could eventually prevail at the state level — though it may take time.

One significant obstacle is the Environmental Management Commission, which is responsible for developing regulations to safeguard, preserve and improve the state’s air and water resources. Since 2022, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality has been working with the commission to establish regulations for PFAS and 1,4 dioxane — a cancer-causing pollutant that’s also been found to be widely discharged by industrial companies and ultimately flow into the Cape Fear River.

However, a series of delays have stalled progress, preventing the process from advancing to the public comment period — the next step toward establishing maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at the state level.

The most recent Environmental Management Commission meeting, on May 7, ended in another delay after the Office of State Budget and Management raised concerns about the proposal’s fiscal analysis.

Possible remedies

Despite the setbacks, several people at the meeting expressed relief, including Haw Riverkeeper Emily Sutton.

“There’s not actually any checks or enforcement to make sure that the plans that are drafted are effective, and so this [plan] doesn’t do anything for our downstream community members,” Sutton said.

She also criticized the fiscal analysis requested by the Office of State Budget and Management.

“The fiscal analysis that they’ve asked for also is flawed. It doesn’t include information about the financial impacts for downstream communities who are bearing the burden of this pollution. [The fiscal analysis] is looking at how much this is going to cost polluting industries. That’s not our concern. Our concern is the health of our community members.”

Southern Environmental Law Center’s Moser agrees that the commission’s proposal falls short of the outcome environmental groups demand.

“The EMC is siding with polluters and considering adopting rules that were written by polluters,” Moser said. “That could allow industrial facilities to release PFAs indefinitely into North Carolina’s drinking water sources and even increase the toxic water pollution that they are putting into our waterways.”

Sutton and Moser and their colleagues are closely monitoring Senate Bill S666 — the Water Safety Act — proposed by North Carolina Senate Majority Leader Michael Lee (R-New Hanover). If passed, the bill would deliver the state-level regulatory action environmentalists are pushing for.

“ [The proposed bill] directs the EMC to set regulatory limits on PFAs, and that is what our hope is,” Sutton said. “We don’t trust that this commission will hold polluters accountable, and unfortunately, the Department of Environmental Quality has to abide by what they are directed by the EMC.”

Moser pointed out that a potential remedy exists to address the water pollution problem:“It’s more important than ever that states like North Carolina, EPA and wastewater treatment plants use their current authority under the Clean Water Act to require that industry stops their pollution at the source before discharging it into our waterways.”

The Environmental Management Commission is scheduled to meet again in July, while the EPA is expected to update federal PFAS standards by late 2025, with finalization anticipated by spring 2026. Amid these ongoing challenges, Jacobs offered a rallying cry to fellow environmentalists: “We just need to keep pushing. We need to keep fighting.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Granular-Activated-Carbon-Filtration-Syst-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-19 06:00:36.822880

PHEVs combine a small battery with a polluting petrol engine and tend to be much more profitable than pure battery electric cars.
The government last month weakened the rules, which force carmakers to sell an increasing number of battery electric cars each year in order to meet the UK’s climate targets.
Keir Starmer argued that the government needed to help struggling carmakers, allowing more “flexibilities” that mean carmakers can sell fewer electric cars and avoid steep fines.
That will give carmakers a strong incentive to sell more PHEVs, as they will gain credits for lower emissions, meaning they have to sell fewer electric cars.","The UK government’s weakening of rules on electric car sales is likely to result in significantly more carbon emissions as sales of plug-in hybrids rise, according to analysis.

Relaxed rules could result in as many as 500,000 additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) on UK roads by 2030, according to modelling by T&E, a campaign group on transport and the environment. PHEVs combine a small battery with a polluting petrol engine and tend to be much more profitable than pure battery electric cars.

Experts said the findings suggested emissions would rise significantly because of the Labour government’s policy. The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, last month told parliament the weaker rules, known as the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, would cause a “negligible change to the carbon emissions” from cars sold in Britain.

The government last month weakened the rules, which force carmakers to sell an increasing number of battery electric cars each year in order to meet the UK’s climate targets. Keir Starmer argued that the government needed to help struggling carmakers, allowing more “flexibilities” that mean carmakers can sell fewer electric cars and avoid steep fines.

Tim Dexter, a vehicle policy manager at T&E UK, said: “The government’s changes will allow car manufacturers to sell more plug-in hybrids and for longer. Instead of accelerating the transition to zero-emission cars, the industry can maximise sales of lucrative PHEVs, which emit far more than claimed.”

In some years the sale of PHEVs could almost double, according to the analysis. PHEV sales are now expected to peak in 2028, at 280,000 a year, up from a previous forecast of 180,000 a year in 2025. Last year the industry sold 167,000 PHEVs, up 18% on the previous year.

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, said: “Not only will this result in more CO2 being emitted in the midst of a climate crisis, it will hit the UK’s drivers in their wallets.”

He said the UK government was “distracting manufacturers from making the shift to building the EVs on which the UK car industry’s future depends”.

Alexander’s emissions claim appeared to be based on government policy that has been criticised by experts for relying on unrealistic figures. Crucially, the government’s analysis assumed PHEVs will continue to achieve the same share of the market as 2024 – despite generous emissions assumptions giving manufacturers a big incentive to sell more hybrids.

PHEVs have a polluting petrol engine but can make big emissions savings by running on a small rechargeable battery whenever possible. In an ideal world, PHEV owners would use the battery for most small trips, only using the engine for longer journeys. However, a number of studies have found that PHEV drivers do not reliably charge their vehicles, meaning the cars emit much more in the real world.

The EU is updating official figures to reflect this disparity. By 2028, average PHEV emissions will be assumed at 109 grams of CO2 per kilometre, up from the 32g average currently used. However, the UK government will continue to use the 32g average despite the Department for Transport in December acknowledging that PHEVs have “much higher CO2 emissions in the real world”. That will give carmakers a strong incentive to sell more PHEVs, as they will gain credits for lower emissions, meaning they have to sell fewer electric cars.

Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive, a thinktank that has closely followed the ZEV mandate, said: “The government – and anyone who has bought a car – knows that manufacturer claims about MPG ratings should be taken with a large helping of salt. Yet ministers have decided to stake the UK’s largest climate policy on the accuracy of these ratings.

“That will sound naive to most people. We should not be surprised to see UK emissions fall more slowly as a result of recent changes to electric car targets.”

T&E’s Dexter said: “The government can still mitigate some of the extra emissions caused by this loophole by officially recognising the real-world emissions of PHEVs. That will account for hybrids’ true climate impact and make buyers aware of their extra cost at the pump.”

A DfT spokesperson said: “Our recent changes strike a practical balance – giving manufacturers flexibility to sell plug-in hybrids until 2035, while sticking to our commitment to the 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars.

“These changes are a practical and balanced approach which will have a minimal impact on emissions while supporting drivers, giving long-term certainty to the industry and protecting jobs across the UK.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c028e1fb226db44bd09a6242b2e13001d249a9c7/1188_0_3352_2684/master/3352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a21531a4a2328ae209fda7e328553343,N,,2025-05-19 05:02:17.309366

However, we know that American reliance on solar energy is growing, although the percentages tend to be small.
Here are four ways you may hear the Spanish blackout talked about in Virginia: 1.
However, the Spanish blackout has brought renewed attention to the importance of battery storage.
Spain has been phasing out its nuclear plants, but now some in Europe are saying the continent needs more nuclear power, not less.","At 12:33 p.m. on April 28, something happened in Spain that you’ll likely hear about in Virginia this fall.

The electric grid across Spain — and then Portugal and a small part of France — suddenly shut down.

The details of what happened are not in dispute: Some strange oscillations in the power grid began at 12:03 p.m., went away, then came back, then went away again. At 12:32:57, to be precise, the power supply suddenly started dropping. Just 27 seconds later, at 12:33:24, the grid collapsed and two counties (and part of a third) were blacked out.

It took until 4 p.m. before power was restored.

For the three and a half hours in between, trains couldn’t run (35,000 passengers were stranded) and planes couldn’t fly (well, they could, but the airports couldn’t operate). Traffic signals ceased to work, forcing police officers to take to key intersections to direct traffic. Bank customers couldn’t access their financial information. Virtually every aspect of a modern, electric-powered society came to a halt. At least five people died, from mechanical ventilators that stopped working or from carbon monoxide from generators that the victims used indoors or, in one case, a fire started by a candle. The impacts of the blackout were felt as far away as Greenland, because the telecom services there rely on a cable that goes through Spain.

What is in dispute is why this blackout, typically described as “catastrophic,” happened. Officially, nobody knows why. Spanish authorities are still investigating. So is the organization that represents 40 different grid operators across Europe. That hasn’t stopped some people from declaring they know the reason anyway. Usually, they blame one thing: solar power.

At the time the Spanish grid blinked out, it was getting 59% of its power from the sun. If you add in 12% wind, Spain was getting 71% of its energy at the time from renewables. Those who don’t think much of renewables were quick to seize on this dependence on solar energy. “It’s very sad to see what’s happened to Portugal and Spain and so many people there, but you know, when you hitch your wagon to the weather, it’s just a risky endeavor,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

There’s no evidence to support this — but also no evidence to deny it, either. The head of energy for the European Union said there was “nothing unusual” about the levels of renewable energy that Spain was relying on that day. Of course, there was also nothing unusual about the power supply that day — until there was none.

The reality is, we simply just don’t know what caused this blackout. We know it started at a single substation in Spain, but beyond that, we don’t know yet. Maybe it was a cyberattack. Maybe it was an old grid that needs to be modernized. Maybe it really was an overreliance on renewables — which do flow into a power grid differently than more conventional sources. That’s not fossil fuel propaganda. The senior climate and energy writer for the MIT Technology Review has written, “Did solar power cause Spain’s blackout?” and while she doesn’t have the answer, either, she does quote one tech expert that “wind and solar don’t contribute to grid stability in the same way that some other power sources do” — so it’s possible that a small problem with grid frequency caused by renewables could have cascaded into a bigger one. The Breakthrough Institute, a left-of-center environmental research group in California, published a cautionary report on the Spanish blackout: “That the Spanish grid collapsed under a bright sun just a half hour past midday fundamentally challenges platitudes that we have already solved the integration challenges of wind and solar power.”

The reason all this matters to us, half a world away, is that we are quite likely to hear about all this in the upcoming gubernatorial and House of Delegates elections in Virginia. That’s because energy is likely to figure in these elections in a way we haven’t seen since perhaps the days of “Howlin’ Henry” Howell railing against Virginia Electric Power in the late 1960s and early 1970s (as seen in this campaign ad from 1971).

Republicans signaled during this year’s General Assembly session that they intend to run against the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the 2020 law that mandates a carbon-free Virginia power grid by 2050. That unleashed a controversial wave of solar development across rural Virginia — controversial because some see solar as an ugly blight that turns their rural landscape into an unwanted industrial one. One Republican argument is the contention that the conversion to renewables is driving up power costs; Democrats counter that solar is actually cheaper than fossil fuels. Another Republican argument is that renewables are inherently unreliable — and that’s where the Spanish blackout provides a convenient and perhaps powerful example. It’s one thing to warn about the specter of blackouts; it’s quite another to point to one that’s already happened — even if nobody knows why it happened. Voters don’t have the patience to learn about the intricacies of “voltage control” or “synchronizing torque” or “ride-through capability,” all things that Power magazine discussed in its report on the blackout. The shorthand of “Spain relied on ‘the weather’ for power and got blacked out” is a lot easier to convey in a 30-second spot.

On the other hand, it’s possible that the Spanish and European reports — which might take weeks to complete — will come back and blame renewables (along with an old grid) to some degree for what happened. Again, we just don’t know.

However, we know that American reliance on solar energy is growing, although the percentages tend to be small. Virginia in April derived about 6% of its power from the sun, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s a bit higher than the national average of 3.9%. Virginia’s wind energy output is almost zero for now. However, Dominion Energy is developing the nation’s largest offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach, and Apex Clean Energy of Charlottesville is building the state’s first onshore wind project in Botetourt County. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.) Nationally, wind is more important than solar — about 10% nationally— mostly because of some Midwestern states where wind is their primary power source. (Iowa gets 65.5% of its power from wind; Kansas 40%, Oklahoma 38%.)

Renewables are also where the growth is: In the first nine months of last year, 90% of the new power added to the U.S. grid nationally came from renewables, with 78% of that coming from solar, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Here’s a telling indication about the growth of renewables: On one sunny day in April, the PJM power grid, which includes the big coal-producing states of West Virginia and Pennsylvania (as well as Virginia), hummed with more power from renewables than from coal. Spring and fall often show high percentages of renewables because there’s not the peak demand of power that freezing winter nights or scorching summer days produce. Still, the point is the debate over power sources is not some academic one, which means the lessons from Spain — whatever they might be — will be important to us.

Here are four ways you may hear the Spanish blackout talked about in Virginia:

1. Expect to hear more about the need for ‘baseload’ power.

This refers to a minimum amount of power that can be counted on and that can supply power continuously. For some, this means natural gas, coal or nuclear (more on nuclear to come). Some renewable advocates, though, contend that the need for baseload power is a myth, that renewables can do just fine, especially when augmented with battery storage (more on that to come, too). Very few of us have the technical expertise to debate all this in a scientific fashion, although that won’t stop people on either side from debating it in political terms. In any case, keep in mind that Virginia will never be 100% reliant on renewables because we currently get about 28% of our power from nuclear energy — and might get more.

2. Expect to hear more about battery storage.

The downside of renewables is that they’re intermittent sources of power — the sun doesn’t shine at night, the wind doesn’t always blow. That can be mitigated by storing power. Critics say that’s not the same as being able to run a gas plant or a nuclear plant or even a coal plant 24/7. After all, even batteries run out at some point. However, the Spanish blackout has brought renewed attention to the importance of battery storage. We already have batteries deployed in Virginia — Martinsville uses one to buy and store power during low-demand times (when power is cheapest) and then put it into the local grid when demand is higher (and power is more expensive). As we develop more renewables, look for more talk about battery storage — they go hand-in-hand.

3. Expect to hear more about nuclear power.

Whether because of concerns about the reliability of renewables or a concern that renewables won’t be able to hit decarbonization goals soon enough, some on the left have now joined with some on the right to embrace nuclear power. It’s not clean energy — there is radioactive waste, which is stored on site — but it’s not carbon-based, either. Spain has been phasing out its nuclear plants, but now some in Europe are saying the continent needs more nuclear power, not less. “If you want a lot of power and you want it to be fossil-free, then nuclear is your pick,” the Swedish energy minister told Politico. “The whole of the EU should not make the Spanish mistake” of not having enough backup power available.

In the United States, nuclear is now seeing a renaissance after falling into disfavor after the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have pushed for more nuclear power. In Virginia, so have both candidates for governor — Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. The specific interest has been in a new type of small reactor known as small modular reactors. The only ones operable right now are in Russia and China, but the hope is that these reactors can be produced quickly and therefore relatively inexpensively, which would get around the traditional problem with nuclear power, which is that it’s slow and expensive to build. In Virginia, both Dominion and Appalachian Power are exploring these small reactors — Dominion at its existing North Anna nuclear site in Louisa County, Appalachian at its Joshua Falls substation in Campbell County.

4. Expect to hear more talk about ‘grid reliability.‘

Regardless of what’s to blame for the Spanish blackout, the fact is that many of Spain’s transmission lines are old — from the 1960s, in some cases. Transmission lines must be kept up-to-date, just like almost everything else. That hasn’t always happened. “While global investment in renewables has nearly doubled since 2010, investment in grids has barely changed at around $300 billion a year,” the Reuters news agency reports. “The amount needs to double by 2030 to over $600 billion a year to cover the necessary overhauls, according to the International Energy Agency.” Fortunately, Virginia is ahead of most states. The website Generator Source says Virginia ranks 13th for grid reliability (Utah ranks first; Louisiana last). Both Dominion Energy and Appalachia Power have embarked on “grid transformation” projects. However, that’s a bit more complicated than, say, repaving a highway. The more things we want to plug in, the more we need a grid that can handle all that power.

All this comes against a backdrop of growing power demands. The General Assembly’s research arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, produced a report in December that warned that if data center growth isn’t restrained, the demand for power in Virginia will triple. The PJM grid recently issued an advisory that, under its worst-case scenario, there won’t be enough power at certain times this summer.

Even without data centers, Virginia may need to produce more power anyway. We now import more power than any other state in the country — and that imported power tends to be more expensive than that we produce in-state. If we want cheaper power, we need cheaper sources. The problem with that is that nobody wants a power plant next to them. It’s a fine thing for politicians to say we need more power from this or more power from that, the trick is finding a place to do that. Solar has become controversial across Southside. We just saw 10 years of controversy over a natural gas pipeline. Some in Southwest Virginia objected to just the mention of a possible nuclear plant. The details of how we solve this conundrum will be both fascinating and perhaps messy. Politicians have some say in this, but not complete say. Market forces play some role, too. West Virginia legislators recently asked Appalachian executives whether having more data centers in the state would lead the utility to burn more coal. The answer was “no,” Appalachian would turn to natural gas because that’s cheaper.

So, when you hear candidates this fall debate energy, this is some of the background you’ll need to know — and that’s why what those reports into the Spanish blackout have to say might wind up being part of the Virginia campaigns.

AI, crypto, microchips, finance, aerospace, healthcare, real estate, were all on the agenda. But it’s energy that was one of the most attractive destinations for investment – both into the Gulf, and the US.

The Gulf has indeed moved into the US energy sector more deeply recently, mostly with gas deals for Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Abu Dhabi strategic investor Mubadala. ADNOC’s new XRG unit is said to be looking for more gas assets in the US. In sharp contrast to oil, US gas prices have risen this year, and are supported by the rush to power data centres for AI.

During President Trump’s tour, the UAE committed to investing $440 billion in the US energy sector over the next decade, up from the current $70 billion. This includes the first primary aluminium smelter built in the US since 1980, which Emirates Global Aluminium will build in Oklahoma. Interestingly, XRG will also look at a 0.5 million tonne per year plant to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air, in partnership with Occidental in Texas.

Shale specialist enters Abu Dhabi

Conversely US companies will put $60 billion into UAE energy projects. This includes the entry of shale specialist EOG into Abu Dhabi, along with further investments by Occidental and ExxonMobil.

The state visit also brought deals for Saudi Arabia, said to total $600 billion: in particular, memoranda of understanding and agreements potentially worth $90 billion for Saudi Aramco, covering gas, chemicals, AI and other areas. Most notable was progress on three US LNG projects, Port Arthur with Sempra Energy, Louisiana with Woodside, and Rio Grande with Next Decade, with Aramco purchasing gas and/or investing. And the state oil giant will invest $3.4 billion in upgrading its Motiva refinery in Texas, the biggest in the US.

Stake in Golden Pass LNG plant

Qatar, which had no eye-catching energy announcements this time, has had a share in the under-construction Golden Pass LNG plant in Texas with ExxonMobil since 2019.

Going the other way, Riyadh has long sought a “123” deal on civil nuclear power cooperation. But it wants to be able to enrich uranium domestically, which traditional US policy has generally ruled out. It now appears Washington is no longer conditioning a 123 agreement on Saudi recognition of Israel, which remains out of reach while Israel continues its abandonment of the ceasefire and blockades Gaza. But President Trump’s visit brought no public progress in this area.

Scope for processing minerals

The Saudi and US energy ministries did agree to cooperate on mining and processing critical minerals, a less contentious and more straightforward area. Saudi Arabia has resources of gold, copper, phosphate, rare earths and other minerals of strategic importance. Both it and the UAE have invested significantly recently in resources in Africa. Non-Chinese sources are of keen interest to Washington. The Gulf, with its low energy costs and central geography, could also be a good place for processing minerals, an area where China is even more dominant than in their extraction.

However, the trip left behind two major contradictions.

First is the direction of investment. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in April: “It's going to involve investments both ways, massive UAE investments in the United States, and we’re going to see continued geo-strategic co-operation with the UAE.”

Oil price outlook

Saudi Arabia has been struggling to achieve its targets for attracting foreign direct investment. Oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation, mining are among its strongest suits for wooing FDI. But it’s not clear the US has much to offer. American companies do feature in the minerals sector, and GE Vernova signed up during the visit to provide $14.2 billion of gas turbines and other systems. But recent investment and supply of equipment for areas from refining to solar to electric vehicles has much more preferred Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean companies.

Going the other way, President Trump has demanded lower oil prices to curb inflation. OPEC+ has obliged, though for its own, different reasons, instituting two large production increases. Lower oil prices, consequent on higher production as well as the economic worries triggered by tariffs, mean the Gulf countries have less to spend overseas, alongside heavy domestic development priorities. A possible deal with Iran over its nuclear programme would release yet more oil on to the market.

That matters less for deep-pocketed Qatar and the UAE, but it does challenge Saudi Arabia. The requested $1 trillion investment by the Kingdom in the US, always implausible, now is absolutely out of reach.

Contrasting forecasts for US drilling

It is understandable that during the visit, the oil exporters wanted their production policy to seem in accordance with President Trump’s wishes, and with internal discipline, not with bashing a successful American industry. But that is the practical outcome. Lower prices have already led to a slowdown in US drilling, and could lead to a stagnation or even decline in output this year, contrasting with forecasts of just three months ago for significant growth. Valuations in the US shale patch may be more attractive, but a shadow has fallen over its longer-term future.

The second contradiction is in US domestic energy policy. Renewable and nuclear power and electric vehicles are all attractive areas for Gulf investors. In October, after buying independent US renewable generator Terra-Gen, Abu Dhabi clean energy investor Masdar said it saw the US as one of its fastest growth markets, and targeted 10 gigawatts of capacity there out of its overall target of 100 GW by 2030. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund holds more than 58 percent of the shares of electric carmaker Lucid.

But the Trump administration is not friendly to energy other than oil and gas, even nuclear which initially seemed favoured. The budget bill now making its way through Congress looks set to gut nearly all support for solar, wind, hydrogen, nuclear, batteries and electric vehicles.

Eye-catching announcements

Both the GCC countries and President Trump got what they wanted from the tour: some specific deals, eye-catching announcements, warm words and no public clashes over controversial issues.

The headline investment numbers from the three Gulf countries are massive, with a fair share of double-counting and repeats of previous commitments.

Poland, now Europe’s fastest-growing economy, has emerged as a vital partner in Washington’s broader efforts to reduce European reliance on Russian energy. With the European Union accelerating efforts to phase out Russian natural gas, U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear technology are set to play a central role in the continent’s future energy mix—and Poland is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift, Caliber.Az reports, citing an article by The National Interest.

Recent developments underscore the deepening energy partnership. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright visited Warsaw to oversee the signing of a key Engineering Development Agreement between the Westinghouse-Bechtel Consortium and Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe (PEJ) for the construction of Poland’s first AP-1000 nuclear power plant. The three-unit facility marks a historic step in Poland’s long-term strategy to diversify its energy sources and is expected to generate thousands of American jobs across the supply chain. A second plant is also in the planning stages.

Poland plans to construct three nuclear power plants domestically and support others across the Three Seas region—a zone bounded by the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic Seas. The region is emerging as a battleground for global energy influence, with Russia, China, Japan, and France vying for major infrastructure contracts. The U.S., working in close coordination with Poland, aims to secure its role as the region’s leading energy partner.

The transatlantic cooperation extends beyond traditional nuclear reactors. Small modular reactors (SMRs), LNG terminals, and pipeline integration all form part of Poland’s pragmatic “all-of-the-above” strategy. The Świnoujście LNG terminal—Poland’s flagship import facility—is already the second-largest on the Baltic Sea after Germany’s Wilhelmshaven and serves as a crucial node in Central Europe’s energy network.

Beyond energy, Poland’s robust military investment—allocating more than 4 per cent of GDP to defence—adds to its growing stature as a reliable U.S. ally in confronting shared adversaries such as Russia and China. U.S. officials have described Poland as embodying the core tenets of a reinvigorated transatlantic alliance: a dynamic economy, strategic location, and deep commitment to regional security.

This vision aligns with Poland’s broader geopolitical outlook, shaped by the country’s wartime history and post-Soviet scepticism. Poland and the Baltic states were early critics of Germany’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, warning of the strategic risks of European dependence on Russian gas—a view later echoed by the Trump administration.

Poland has also taken a leading role in the Three Seas Initiative (3SI), a regional infrastructure and connectivity platform launched with Croatia. The initiative offers a democratic, self-sustaining alternative to China's “16+1” framework and has received strong backing from Washington. Former President Donald Trump personally endorsed the 3SI during his first term, promising U.S. financial support.

President Donald Trump wants to revive the struggling coal industry in the U.S. by deploying plants to power the data centers that the Big Tech companies are building to train artificial intelligence.

Trump issued an executive order in April that directed his Cabinet to find areas of the U.S. where coal-powered infrastructure is available to support AI data centers and determine whether the infrastructure can be expanded to meet the growing electricity demand from the nation's tech sector.

Trump has repeatedly promoted coal as power source for data centers. The president told the World Economic Forum in January that he would approve power plants for AI through emergency declaration, calling on the tech companies to use coal as a backup power source.

""They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup — good, clean coal,"" the president said.

Trump's push to deploy coal runs afoul of the tech companies' environmental goals. In the short-term, the industry's power needs may inadvertently be extending the life of existing coal plants.

Coal produces more carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of power than any other energy source in the U.S. with the exception of oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. The tech industry has invested billions of dollars to expand renewable energy and is increasingly turning to nuclear power as a way to meet its growing electricity demand while trying to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that fuel climate change.

For coal miners, Trump's push is a potential lifeline. The industry has been in decline as coal plants are being retired in the U.S. About 16% of U.S. electricity generation came from burning coal in 2023, down from 51% in 2001, according to EIA data.

Peabody Energy CEO James Grech, who attended Trump's executive order ceremony at the White House, said ""coal plants can shoulder a heavier load of meeting U.S. generation demands, including multiple years of data center growth."" Peabody is one of the largest coal producers in the U.S.

Grech said coal plants should ramp up how much power they dispatch. The nation's coal fleet is dispatching about 42% of its maximum capacity right now, compared to a historical average of 72%, the CEO told analysts on the company's May 6 earnings call.

""We believe that all coal-powered generators need to defer U.S. coal plant retirements as the situation on the ground has clearly changed,"" Grech said. ""We believe generators should un-retire coal plants that have recently been mothballed.""

Tech sector reaction

There is a growing acknowledgment within the tech industry that fossil fuel generation will be needed to help meet the electricity demand from AI. But the focus is on natural gas, which emits less half the CO2 of coal per kilowatt hour of power, according the the EIA.

""To have the energy we need for the grid, it's going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time,"" Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said during a panel discussion at conference of tech and oil and gas executives in Oklahoma City last month.

""We're not surprised by the fact that we're going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term,"" Miller said.

Thermal generation is a code word for gas, said Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure and power resources for data centers. Sahlstrom previously led Amazon's energy, water and sustainability teams.

Executives at Amazon , Nvidia and Anthropic would not commit to using coal, mostly dodging the question when asked during the panel at the Oklahoma City conference.

""It's never a simple answer,"" Amazon's Miller said. ""It is a combination of where's the energy available, what are other alternatives.""

Nvidia is able to be agnostic about what type of power is used because of the position the chipmaker occupies on the AI value chain, said Josh Parker, the company's senior director of corporate sustainability. ""Thankfully, we leave most of those decisions up to our customers.""

Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark said there are a broader set of options available than just coal. ""We would certainly consider it but I don't know if I'd say it's at the top of our list.""

Sahlstrom said Trump's executive order seems like a ""dog whistle"" to coal mining constituents. There is a big difference between looking at existing infrastructure and ""actually building new power plants that are cost competitive and are going to be existing 30 to 40 years from now,"" the Tract executive said.

Coal is being displaced by renewables, natural gas and existing nuclear as coal plants face increasingly difficult economics, Sahlstrom said. ""Coal has kind of found itself without a job,"" he said.

""I do not see the hyperscale community going out and signing long term commitments for new coal plants,"" the former Amazon executive said. (The tech companies ramping up AI are frequently referred to as ""hyperscalers."")

""I would be shocked if I saw something like that happen,"" Sahlstrom said.

Coal retirements strain grid

But coal plant retirements are creating a real challenge for the grid as electricity demand is increasing due to data centers, re-industrialization and the broader electrification of the economy.

The largest grid in the nation, the PJM Interconnection, has forecast electricity demand could surge 40% by 2039. PJM warned in 2023 that 40 gigawatts of existing power generation, mostly coal, is at risk of retirement by 2030, which represents about 21% of PJM's installed capacity.

Data centers will temporarily prolong coal demand as utilities scramble to maintain grid reliability, delaying their decarbonization goals, according to a Moody's report from last October. Utilities have already postponed the retirement of coal plants totaling about 39 gigawatts of power, according to data from the National Mining Association.

""If we want to grow America's electricity production meaningfully over the next five or ten years, we [have] got to stop closing coal plants,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" last month.

But natural gas and renewables are the future, Sahlstrom said. Some 60% of the power sector's emissions reductions over the past 20 years are due to gas displacing coal, with the remainder coming from renewables, Sahlstrom said.

""That's a pretty powerful combination, and it's hard for me to see people going backwards by putting more coal into the mix, particularly if you're a hyperscale customer who has net-zero carbon goals,"" he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108128679-17441448062025-04-08t203717z_1739258938_rc2wtdaq0qwu_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump.jpeg?v=1744144838&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:22.831205

A gas-fired turbine is a giant engine that transforms the energy in natural gas into electricity using a continuous, high-speed process.
How a Natural Gas Turbine Generates Electricity.","There is tremendous buzz around natural-gas-fired turbines right now with backlogs reportedly stretching five years into the future due to supply-chain bottlenecks, labor shortages and a surge in demand. The power generation industry is poised for a major upswing as data center development and overall electricity demand continue to accelerate, driving an even greater need for gas turbines. In today’s RBN blog, we will explore why gas turbines are so challenging to build and why there’s such a manufacturing backlog.

As we noted recently in Only Happy When It Rains, there’s been a lot of talk the past few months about artificial intelligence (AI) and plans by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others to build a slew of data centers — energy hogs that require vast amounts of around-the-clock electricity. Developers have been considering the full gamut of power-generation sources — everything from renewables to nuclear — but almost everyone understands that gas-fired plants will be a big part of the solution. A number of major gas producers and just about every big midstreamer with a gas pipeline network have been talking up their plans to serve these new power plants, and several gas-fired projects — many tied directly to data centers — have already been announced. And while there are other fundamental factors stimulating demand for gas-fired power generation, the high profile of the data center development has put a spotlight on the prospects for acquiring the turbines needed to run a gas-fired power plant, a bigger challenge than it might appear.

Before we get into what’s behind the turbine bottleneck, let’s start with some basics on turbines and how they work. A gas-fired turbine is a giant engine that transforms the energy in natural gas into electricity using a continuous, high-speed process. As shown in Figure 1 below, it works by taking in air, squeezing it tightly and mixing it with fuel — creating a fiery (but controlled) explosion in its combustion chamber. The blast of hot, high-pressure gases rushes through and spins the turbine’s blades. The spinner on the turbine turns a shaft connected to a generator (bottom portion of graphic), where the mechanical energy is then turned into electricity. It then heads to a transformer, which increases the voltage, and then to a transmission line. (High-voltage lines allow electricity to be transmitted over long distances with minimal losses.)

The Village aims to have net-zero generation by 2050, and many urged the council to delay their decision as the contract is not set to expire until September 2035 and a renewed contract — for which IMEA is lobbying – would extend to 2055.

According to Village documents, IMEA acquires power and energy through an IMEA-owned plant and other power generating entities and uses energy from the Village’s electrical plant and 31 other municipal generation operations. The output of Winnetka’s plant is dedicated to IMEA, in exchange for monthly capacity payments and fuel costs.

PJM, or Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, is a regional transmission organization. Partnering with PJM would provide Winnetka with a marketplace to acquire electricity from companies like ComEd and even IMEA. PJM is the largest wholesale electricity market in the nation, and oversees 13 states and Washington, D.C.

Narhi and Pruitt laid out pros and cons to each, ensuring they touched on cost and sustainability.

Positives of IMEA

According to Narhi, the Village has accrued $47 million in capacity credits with IMEA since joining, because their plant helps fuel the organization. During a recent meeting, IMEA approved a more generous capacity payment structure that could allow the Village to profit even more over the next 10 years.

Another advantage, according to Narhi, is that staying with IMEA would allow for better planning. With Winnetka’s energy load being mainly residential, Narhi believes that IMEA provides clearer pricing in comparison to purchasing energy through wholesale.

IMEA’s energy is generated through solar, wind, hydroelectric and coal, as stated on its website. With sustainability being a key concern, Narhi did stress that IMEA is working to build a more climate-friendly infrastructure, including making rooftop solar panels more accessible and renewable energy credits possible.

PJM benefits

Pruitt presented to the council about PJM. The challenge to the wholesale market is the unpredictable nature of the cost of energy. The demand for energy increases, while the supply of resources decreases as they are strained by data centers and other large energy consumers. Meaning that the cost of energy is only going to increase, which would make financial forecasting much more difficult in the wholesale market.

PJM, however, better aligns with Winnetka’s sustainable needs. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, PJM also uses coal, but since they pull power from 13 states, 14% of PJM’s generation comes from coal.

The EIA article states, “In 2023, the use of coal-fired generation in PJM dropped to 34% of capacity. In 2023, coal-fired generation contributed 14% of PJM’s generation, while it made up 18% of its generating capacity. By comparison, in 2013, the capacity factor of coal-fired power plants in the market was 56%, when coal-fired power made up 44% of the market’s generation and 38% of its capacity.”

’10 years’

Following the presentation, residents took to the stand to voice their concerns, specifically on sustainability.

Laith Amin, a Winnetka resident and vice president of growth and strategic development for EcoEngineers, voiced concerns over the rush to renew a contract not set to expire for 10 years.

“So if we were to build an energy plan, identify our goals, do extensive consultation, take the time that we need, the time is on our side. We’ve really got 10 years. We will come to exactly the right result,” Amin told the council.

The council agreed that it was crucial to provide IMEA with an update on their discussion, considering it is a founding municipality, but emphasized that there is no rush to decide.

Roy, who also sits on the Rules panel, would not commit to voting to advance the bill in that upcoming vote.
The vote comes after four hardline conservatives on the committee tanked a vote on the legislation Friday, saying the cost-cutting measures in the bill did not go far enough.
While those changes are not fully ironed out, it was good enough for the holdouts to allow them to go forward.
“In an effort to move this bill forward, and I’m excited about the changes we’ve made, I vote present,” Norman said.","Republican deficit hawks allowed President Trump’s bill of legislative priorities to advance out of the House Budget Committee in an unusual late-night vote on Sunday, marking a key hurdle cleared for House GOP leaders and a sign of progress for warring Republican factions

After gaveling in after 10 p.m. on Sunday, the committee voted 17-16 to advance the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would extend Trump’s tax cuts and boost his border funding priorities while reforming Medicaid and food assistance programs.

The four Republican holdouts who had tanked the vote on Friday — Reps. Ralph Norman (S.C.), Chip Roy (Texas), Andrew Clyde (Ga.), and Josh Brecheen (Okla.) — voted present to allow the bill to go forward, with Roy revealing that there was progress on moving up the start date for new Medicaid work requirements and speeding up the phase-out of green energy incentives.

In a sign of the high-stakes nature of the vote, the Speaker as well as White House Legislative Affairs Director James Braid made appearances off a room to the side of the late night Budget Committee affair.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said they are counting the vote “as a big win tonight.”

“There’s a lot more work to do, we’ve always acknowledged that towards the end there will be more details to iron out, we have several more to take care of,” Johnson said. “But I’m looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions over the next few days, and I am absolutely convinced we’re going to get this in final form and pass it in accordance with our original deadline, and that was to do it before Memorial Day.”

“So this will be a victory out of committee tonight, everybody will make a vote that allows us to proceed and that was my big request tonight.”

The next stop is the House Rules Committee, which is set to take up the legislation later this week and make last-minute changes to the bill to reflect any compromises and demands between deficit hawks and moderates in high-tax states.

Despite the victory for leadership, the conservatives indicated they still have more work to do.

Roy said that while he voted present “out of respect for the Republican Conference and the President,” the bill “does not yet meet the moment.”

He said the revamped measure would “move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies under the green new scam.” But, in a statement on X, he objected to provisions around green energy tax credits and Medicaid.

“This all ultimately increases the likelihood of continuing deficits and non-Obamacare-expansion states like Texas expanding in the future. We can and must do better before we pass the final product,” he wrote, alluding to wanting even more controversial Medicaid reforms like reining in the provider tax mechanism that allows states to extract more federal Medicaid matching dollars.

Norman also indicated he was looking for changes.

“We had some great changes, got a lot more work to do. We’re excited about what we did, we wanted to move the bill forward and it went like I thought,” he said.

We’ve been downgraded three times, we have problems with the money in this country, the debt, the FMAPs gotta be dealt with,” he said, referencing the share of Medicaid paid for by the federal government.

Roy, who also sits on the Rules panel, would not commit to voting to advance the bill in that upcoming vote. He would not answer questions about whether Trump — who on Friday had pressed Republican “GRANDSTANDERS” to “STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!” — had talked to him about the bill.

The vote comes after four hardline conservatives on the committee tanked a vote on the legislation Friday, saying the cost-cutting measures in the bill did not go far enough.

Those fiscal hawks had said new Medicaid work requirements on “able-bodied” single adults and repeal of green energy incentives do not kick in soon enough, causing them to worry that the savings that are back-loaded on the overall 10-year cost of the package will not actually be realized.

On the other end of the Republican conference, moderates in high-tax states are demanding an increase to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, currently written as $30,000 — a figure that amounts to three times the current level, but that moderates says is not acceptable to win their votes for the sprawling package. Making changes to appease those members will require tweaks to the bill elsewhere.

While those changes are not fully ironed out, it was good enough for the holdouts to allow them to go forward.

“In an effort to move this bill forward, and I’m excited about the changes we’ve made, I vote present,” Norman said.

Democrats on the other side of the room exclaimed: “What changes?”

Ranking member Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) made a number of inquiries on those “side deals” being negotiated behind closed doors, saying that lawmakers and the public deserved to know what those are.

Desire 4 EVs Still Charged

Despite economic uncertainty and shifting market sentiment, consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs) remains steady, according to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study. Released today, the study finds that 24% of car shoppers are “very likely” and 35% are “somewhat likely” to consider an EV—unchanged from 2024.

“EVs have secured a foothold in consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, executive director of J.D. Power’s EV practice. “To build on this, automakers need to offer affordable, compelling products and improve consumer education, especially around public charging.”

Key Highlights:

Active Cross-Shopping: Shoppers “very likely” to consider EVs explore an average of 2.9 brands, suggesting flexibility and openness to new entrants. EV buyers are more brand-agnostic than those shopping for gas-powered vehicles, showing strong potential for market share gains.

Concerns Shift: While price concerns dropped to 43% (down 4 points) and cost of ownership to 33% (down 2 points), public charging access remains the top deterrent at 52%, reflecting persistent misconceptions.

Demographic Divide: Younger consumers (25–49) are most interested in EVs but typically have lower incomes, with only 17% earning over $100,000. Older shoppers, while wealthier, show less interest—highlighting a gap between enthusiasm and affordability.

Regional Variation: EV interest is lowest in Midwest states like Wisconsin, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Ohio, where cold weather concerns and brand loyalty to legacy automakers dampen enthusiasm.

Now in its fifth year, the EVC Study benchmarks EV consideration by region, demographics, and psychographics. This year’s findings are based on 8,164 respondents planning to buy or lease a new vehicle within the next year, surveyed from January to April 2025.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-05-19 05:02:31.702271

Climate resilience requires more than levees and carbon markets.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FEMA should recognize digital infrastructure as eligible under mitigation grant programs.
Environmental regulators across federal agencies should treat digital access as a factor in environmental justice reviews.
Without a new legal and policy framework that connects digital equity to climate resilience, America’s most vulnerable communities will remain dangerously exposed—and unheard.","Equal access to technology is a necessary but overlooked part of responsible environmental regulation.

As the United States braces for what is likely to be another record-setting hurricane and wildfire season, one critical issue remains largely overlooked in emergency planning: the digital divide. In many of the country’s most climate-vulnerable areas, particularly across the American South, limited internet access is silently undermining disaster resilience and deepening environmental injustice.

Although climate policy discussions frequently highlight emissions reduction and energy transition, policymakers often overlook a foundational requirement for adaptation: access to information. In communities without broadband or digital literacy, missing a weather alert, failing to register for evacuation, or not knowing how to apply for disaster aid can be a matter of life or death. This disparity is not simply about convenience—it is about rights and survival.

The Undivide Project, which I direct, launched the Ten States Project to study the digital disparity. Our team conducted interviews with emergency managers, surveyed national and regional stakeholders, and reviewed over 190 laws and policies related to disaster response, digital infrastructure, and environmental justice. From this study of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, and five other states, we found that digital exclusion is not adequately recognized in disaster law and communities without digital access are being structurally excluded from resilience planning.

These communities—many of which are predominantly Black and low-income—are not just underserved; they are systematically excluded from the tools, information, and legal protections necessary to survive a climate emergency. The failure to treat broadband access as an essential utility and emergency service is worsening the climate resilience gap in America.

Our legal review revealed that most state emergency statutes focus almost exclusively on reactive measures, such as declaring a state of emergency, activating the National Guard, or suspending regulations. Fewer than 10 percent of the legal instruments we analyzed mentioned environmental justice. None explicitly addressed digital access.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not currently fund broadband infrastructure as a disaster resilience strategy, despite increasing reliance on digital registration, alerts, and reporting. Without policy change, communities already marginalized by race, income, and geography will remain last in line for assistance—and first in line for disaster impacts.

Consider Alabama’s Black Belt region, where more than 30,000 homes have failing septic systems that are worsening due to increased rainfall. A now-terminated U.S. Department of Justice investigation found that the state’s failure to address wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County constituted a civil rights violation. Residents in this region are also among the least digitally connected in the nation—many do not have reliable access to email or internet-enabled devices. When disaster strikes, they are cut off twice––first by infrastructure, and then again by information.

In Louisiana, redistricting disputes have diluted the voting power of Black communities along the Gulf Coast, while toxic industries continue to expand in “cancer alley.” In Texas, communities of color disproportionately suffered during the Great Freeze of 2021, and many were left without digital access to information about warming centers, emergency benefits, or infrastructure outages. These cases are not outliers—they are the product of a systemic failure to integrate digital equity into environmental and disaster law.

Climate resilience requires more than levees and carbon markets. It demands governance models that recognize digital infrastructure as essential to disaster response, community agency, and adaptive capacity. Legal scholars and regulators must begin treating broadband like electricity or water—a necessary condition for public safety and access to emergency services.

We propose a new framework: digital equity as a climate adaptation imperative. This means incorporating digital inclusion into the legal definitions of “resilience” and “mitigation” in state and federal codes. It means requiring environmental justice assessments to include digital exclusion. It means directing resilience funding to places where climate and digital vulnerability overlap.

Some states are taking steps in this direction. Virginia passed the Environmental Justice Act in 2020, which defines “fenceline” vulnerable communities and created an Office of Environmental Justice within its emergency management agency. North Carolina incorporated digital infrastructure planning into its resilience funding strategy. But without federal agency action and statutory mandates, these state efforts remain fragmented and insufficient.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FEMA should recognize digital infrastructure as eligible under mitigation grant programs. This includes broadband deployment, hot spot expansion, and digital literacy training for disaster preparedness.

Environmental regulators across federal agencies should treat digital access as a factor in environmental justice reviews. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could update its—recently removed—equity screening tools to include digital exclusion as a risk multiplier.

To supplement agency efforts, the U.S. Congress should modernize disaster law to reflect digital dependence. Updating the Stafford Act for example, to include digital equity and removing administrative barriers to broadband resilience projects would expand legal protections to communities that are currently excluded.

Voting rights protections enacted by Congress should also include digital participation safeguards. Communities must be able to engage in climate-related policy debates and disaster planning. Digital disenfranchisement undermines civic engagement and climate governance.

Ultimately, the digital divide is not just a technology issue—it is a governance issue. It reflects who has access to safety, who is heard in times of crisis, and who is left behind. As we prepare for a future of escalating climate extremes, we must ensure that digital equity is part of every emergency plan, every resilience policy, and every legal reform.

Environmental and disaster regulators have a responsibility to act. Without a new legal and policy framework that connects digital equity to climate resilience, America’s most vulnerable communities will remain dangerously exposed—and unheard.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sanders5.19.25-2177991924.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 04:08:42.671668

Critics argue that these moves bypass lawful rulemaking processes, potentially violating laws such as the Administrative Procedure Act.

Richard Revesz, former head of the White House regulatory affairs office under President Joe Biden, stated, ""They're making across-the-board decisions not to enforce whole categories of standards, and it is of very dubious legality.""

The administration's actions have also impacted the Labor Department, where enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws has sputtered. Employees report that work at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has ground to a halt, even though much of it is still mandated by laws from the 1970s that have not been overturned.

These enforcement slowdowns have led to reduced hiring in legal sectors that defend companies against regulatory actions.

Stephen Springer, a managing partner at a legal recruiting firm, noted, ""CFPB enforcement work is dormant completely. I don't think anybody expects those enforcement areas to be particularly busy for the next three years.""

Legal experts warn that the administration's approach, choosing not to enforce laws the president dislikes, is unprecedented and legally dubious. Peter Shane, an emeritus law professor at Ohio State University, remarked, ""To my knowledge, no other president has taken that kind of stance.""

BACKGROUND

Congressman Griffith is chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment.

In March of 2025, Congressman Griffith chaired a hearing on the EPA’s Brownfields Program. Scott County Native and LENOWISCO Executive Director Duane Miller testified to the panel and discussed the Program’s importance to Southwest Virginia communities.

The Brownfields Program empowers states, communities and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse brownfields.

A brownfield site is real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.

Brownfield Assessment grants provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments and community outreach.

The automaker revealed this week it was “re-evaluating” its electrification strategy amid a turbulent and uncertain time for the auto industry.

Also: Subaru Trailseeker Is Faster Than A WRX But No One Knows If It’s A Wagon Or SUV

Look at Subaru’s US website and you’ll find just one EV: the recently facelifted Solterra. A second, the Outback-sized Trailseeker that made its debut at last month’s New York Auto Show, is scheduled to be added to the range for 2026. But we’re unlikely to see many more EVs join it any time soon.

Tariffs and Tax Credits: The Great Unknowns

Aside from a general concern about a slowdown in the rate of EV takeup, Subaru, like every other automaker, is hamstrung by a lack of clarity from the US regarding its long term position on both import tariffs and EV tax credits. Nobody knows what the tariff situation will look like six or 12 months from now or whether tax credits will be scrapped or not.

Subaru estimates Trump’s tariffs could cost it $2.5 billion this year because, although the company does have a plant in Indiana, it only builds around half of the 700,000+ cars the brand sells in the US each year, Auto News reports. The remainder have to be imported, an d while Subaru could theoretically push the US plant’s current 345,000-unit annual capacity to 500,000, its supplier base can’t handle more than 370,000 units without a major upgrade.

Overseas Production and Shifting Plans

That means the Trailseeker will probably have to be built overseas, Auto News suggesting production will take place north of Tokyo. Subaru also had planned to create a new EV-only plant, but is rethinking that strategy, too. It now says it might have to add combustion vehicles into the mix at the new site.

Plans to simplify EU sustainability reporting and due diligence rules lack sound economic analysis

Tabled in February, the European Commission’s omnibus proposal remains the talk of the day in sustainability policy circles. The EU executive is seeking to water down multiple laws, including the recently adopted Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

The CSDDD was only agreed on last year, and trade unions, civil society and progressive companies had considered it as a game-changer towards sustainability in global supply chains. However, the commission has started to question its own approach.

The legislation was intended to force large European and foreign companies to comply with human rights standards. The CSDDD looks likely to be significantly weakened in the name of competitiveness and economic performance, even though the commission’s unpredictable behaviour will do nothing to create trust in EU economic governance.

While many companies had already started to prepare for the newly established legislation, they now face substantial uncertainty. Indeed, the commission’s behaviour fuels fundamental uncertainty about the overall direction in the bloc in terms of sustainability policies. Will the EU remain a progressive international standard setter, or will it join a race to the bottom that it will never be able to win?

Today, in a statement co-signed by more than 80 economists from 11 EU member states, we express our concern that the commission’s proposal lacks substantial arguments and seems to be rooted in short-sighted political tactics rather than in sound economic analysis.

A value-based modern economy

Contrary to what the commission is arguing, sustainability legislation is less of a burden and more of an opportunity for European companies. In times of erratic “Trumponomics”, a clear and lasting approach to sustainability could enhance the EU’s position as a value-based modern economy that builds its wealth not on a systematic abuse of human rights abroad.

Much of the commission’s arguments used to weaken the support for the CSDDD focus on compliance costs for companies constituting an administrative burden. Most regulations come with associated costs. However, the commission’s own research has shown that compliance costs for large companies are a negligible percentage of revenues generated. The costs, however, are only one side of the equation.

The EU directive, in supporting compliance with human rights, also offers opportunities to reduce significantly the costs of economic activities that companies generate for third parties — so-called negative externalities.

The externalisation of costs harms local livelihoods and exporting economies and can also harm the economy more broadly. Human rights abuses such as poverty wages, unhealthy work conditions and the use of harmful pesticide create additional costs for society and are, unfortunately, too common in many economies of the global south. They also prevent affected countries from diversifying their economies and claiming a larger share of the value produced in global value chains.

The second political argument by the commission, that the CSDDD and the CSRD harm European competitiveness, also evaporates at closer scrutiny.

The sluggishness of the European economy can hardly be attributed to laws that have not yet been implemented or that have just entered into force. Restrictive fiscal policies and a systematic lack of investments in public goods, including infrastructure, a conflict-ridden global environment, and an export-oriented global model — now in crisis also due to US tariffs — are much more significant explanations.

Yet, these are much harder problems to solve. They require proper economic and industrial policies, rather than populist political moves pretending that cutting compliance costs will bring EU economies back to growth. On the contrary, a stable commitment to maintain a strong focus on sustainability in Europe is likely to provide a reliable context for European companies to adapt their long-term strategies and to promote sustainable growth.

In conclusion, the idea that sustainability obligations only create costs for companies is misguided. Legislators should also look at the benefits that the CSDDD will have for European economies and for the economies of its trading partners. Overall, the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs by far.

Economic choices are political choices. With the omnibus proposal, the commission is cheering short-sighted populist calls and deviating attention from the big challenges the European economy faces. By continuing to allow for external costs and human rights abuses in supply chains, the EU risks falling back on its regulatory achievements in terms of sustainability.

The European parliament and the European Council can still stop the watering down of sustainability legislation. The failure to do so will come at a cost to us all.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/6ccca3b6-3d87-4cbf-85fd-e0138b543336.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 22:00:06.914106

The LMR cells are designed to be a middle ground, offering a balance of cost and range for popular segments.","General Motors has announced a significant advancement in its electric vehicle battery technology: new lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic cells that are designed to slash manufacturing costs. This development, part of an extended partnership with LG Energy Solution, aims to create a future where a Chevrolet Silverado EV could be as affordable as a V8-powered Silverado 1500.

We've heard claims like these before, and they often come with extended timelines, but GM seems to believe this breakthrough can be brought to the market very soon.

A New Shape For A New Mineral

The core of this innovation lies in a shift in battery chemistry and design. GM's new LMR prismatic cells will utilize more affordable manganese in place of pricier nickel. Cobalt, another expensive material, will also see its role diminished. According to Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of propulsion and sustainability, the ultimate goal is to achieve price parity between electric and gas vehicles.

Physically, the new LMR prismatic cells are notably larger than the pouch cells currently used in vehicles like the Silverado EV, with each new cell weighing between six and eleven pounds and resembling an old DVD player in shape. GM anticipates it could reduce the number of modules required in a large EV battery pack, from 24 to just six. Despite the focus on costs, GM also claims these LMR cells boast 33 percent higher energy density than comparable lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) prismatic cells. These can be found in vehicles like specific models of the Tesla Model 3.

Strategic Sourcing, Diverse Applications

This new LMR technology is slated to first appear in GM's electric pickups and full-size SUVs launching in 2028. It is one part of GM's broader battery strategy, which involves deploying different battery chemistries for different vehicle types. More affordable LFP cells might be used in entry-level EVs where maximum range is less critical, such as a potential next-generation Chevy Bolt. High-nickel NMCA cells would be reserved for premium vehicles where customers would demand the most range, like the big and luxurious Cadillac Escalade IQ. The LMR cells are designed to be a middle ground, offering a balance of cost and range for popular segments.

To support this development, GM is also investing in its supply chain. In 2023, the company partnered with Element 25, investing $85 million to build a facility in Louisiana that will process manganese mined in Australia. GM says that its long-term domestic battery production strategy is not in reaction to recent developments with tariffs, and dates back several years.

Validation of the new LMR cells is scheduled to occur in 2027 at GM's Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, Michigan. The company is already fine-tuning the production processes for these cells, from mixing raw materials to creating electrodes from ultra-thin aluminum sheets. While the specific manufacturing locations for the LMR cells have not yet been announced, GM's existing Ultium Cells joint venture with LG Energy Solution has already produced over 100 million battery cells at plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

Importantly, General Motors assures that future vehicles equipped with these new LMR prismatic cells will maintain capabilities such as rapid DC fast-charging and will also be covered by the existing 100,000-mile battery warranty, ensuring that cost savings do not come at the expense of core EV necessities.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chevrolet-silverado-ev.png,N,,2025-05-18 21:01:59.083302

China Isn't Slowing Down. - InsideEVs,Tim Levin,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/759907/ev-sales-slowdown-trump-ira/,"While much of the world races to build and sell more electric vehicles, America is on track to become an also-ran.
In last year’s report, the organization estimated that EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would make up 55% of U.S. car sales by the end of the decade.
Meanwhile, China has already created the infrastructure and industry required for rapid EV sales growth.

EV sales globally are projected to skyrocket, no matter who sits in the White House or how they feel about electric cars.","While much of the world races to build and sell more electric vehicles, America is on track to become an also-ran.

This week, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 Global EV Outlook, in which it projects that the share of plug-in car sales in the U.S. will increase from 10% today to 20% in 2030. That may sound like healthy growth—until you consider what the IEA had expected before the newly elected Republican trifecta began dismantling pro-EV policies.

In last year’s report, the organization estimated that EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would make up 55% of U.S. car sales by the end of the decade. Even in that rosier scenario, China would still be eating America’s lunch by a wide margin. Now, it won’t even be close.

From day one of President Donald Trump’s second term, the IEA notes, it became U.S. policy to “eliminate subsidies and other policy measures influencing markets in favour of EVs.” Here’s a quick recap of where things stand.

Congress is in the early stages of repealing the $7,500 clean-car tax credit, a key driver of EV affordability and sales. The Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency are each expected to relax tailpipe-pollution regulations that push automakers to clean up their fleets. There’s an effort underway to strip California of its ability to set an EV sales mandate, a framework that 11 other states and Washington, D.C. follow. And the federal government has effectively frozen billions of dollars in funding intended to beef up the nation’s charging infrastructure.

Meanwhile, China has already created the infrastructure and industry required for rapid EV sales growth. The IEA now projects that EVs and PHEVs will make up 80% of the country’s car sales by 2030, thanks to improvements in vehicle affordability, policies that make them cheaper to buy and government support for building out charging stations. This year, the IEA revised up its 2030 EV outlook for China by around 14 percentage points.

Europe is projected to leave America in its dust too, with an electric share of sales nearing 60%.

Other researchers who watch this space now see a similarly stunted trajectory for the U.S. EV sector, at least compared to what could have been.

In an April report, the International Council on Clean Transportation found that eliminating the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for EV buyers and manufacturers would depress plug-in car sales by 1.1 million units in 2030. It also projected that an IRA repeal would cost the U.S. 130,000 jobs across the vehicle manufacturing, battery and charging industries by that year.

Having a vibrant EV industry isn’t just about selling more clean cars or cutting planet-warming emissions. America’s competitiveness is at stake too, said Peter Slowik, the ICCT’s U.S. passenger vehicles lead and a co-author of the report.

“Long term, we will get to 100% [zero-emission vehicles]. And the question is: Who will be the winners and who will be the losers?,” he told InsideEVs. “When we do get to 100%, are U.S. vehicles going to be a bunch of imports from European automakers and China automakers and automakers from elsewhere? Or will we be able to preserve or even increase our market share?”

The ICCT still expects U.S. electric car sales to grow—albeit more modestly—in a no-IRA scenario, with demand propelled mainly by declining vehicle costs and technological improvements. ""There will be no turning back, even if incentives went away,"" Slowik said.

But the rest of the world isn’t sitting still. EV sales globally are projected to skyrocket, no matter who sits in the White House or how they feel about electric cars.

This year, the IEA expects a record 20 million plug-in car sales worldwide, accounting for around 25% of overall sales. By 2030, that number should hit 40 million—28 million EVs and 12 million PHEVs—or over 40% of global sales.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P306OA/s1/ford-f-150-lightning-mustang-mach-e.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 23:03:23.130195

However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.
The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.
While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles.
""We feel good about where pricing is versus where we started the year, so we've assumed things remain constant from here,"" Jacobson said, according to Inside EVs.","Inside EVs reported that General Motors is not planning to raise prices due to the current administration's tariff policies.

""We now expect pricing to be relatively consistent for the remainder of the year."" GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated, according to the report.

This announcement is surprising. Several of GM's EVs are assembled in Mexico, so the company is bracing for a huge cost impact in the billions of dollars. However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.

The article cites that the Equinox EV is currently the most affordable EV in the U.S. and that GM credits its Mexico build location for keeping costs so low. The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.

GM said it is expecting a $4 billion to $5 billion impact based on the current tariff policy, affecting imports from Korea, Mexico, and Canada. It plans to offset some of the costs with ""self-help initiatives"" and increased U.S. production of battery components, according to the report.

Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV has environmental and financial benefits. EVs do not produce air pollution that contributes to the warming of the planet, so it is a more eco-friendly transportation choice. EV owners can say goodbye to rising, fluctuating gas prices, saving money over time.

Some EV skeptics cite the negative environmental effects that are a result of the pollution created during the battery manufacturing and charging process. While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles. Roughly 30 million tons of minerals are dug up annually for the more affordable energy transition to EVs, and these minerals can often be reused, further reducing the environmental impact.

Jacobson is confident that GM's wide EV lineup – from the $35,000 Equinox EV to the $130,000 Cadillac Escalade IQ – will help the company maintain pricing.

IRA Labor Policy The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment.
Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.
As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created.
Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.","“It’s unfathomable to us. Unfathomable. In the history of our union hall, 134 years, we’ve never even come close to these numbers.” Trent Mauk, a training specialist at the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) in Michigan, said these words to Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein just over a year ago.

Mauk was referring to the massive growth in membership the union experienced thanks to the construction of two new electric vehicle battery plants. These plants were a direct result of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022. Before the IRA, UA members had to travel for work and experienced long bouts of unemployment. After its implementation, their apprentice program jumped from fifty trainees to almost two hundred.

With its reputation as an ambitious climate bill, it’s easy to overlook the IRA’s role in creating opportunities for unions in the clean energy sector. The building trades, often unfairly portrayed as uniformly opposed to climate action, have seen a substantial number of real jobs materialize for their members. This has translated into more general political support for clean energy development.

Key components of this legislation are now under threat as Republicans close in on their goal to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a $4 trillion tax cut for the rich. Paying for this primarily through cutting social programs like Medicaid is proving politically complicated. Republicans are now setting their sights on IRA tax credits, many of which are directly responsible for creating union jobs, as an area for cuts in the budget reconciliation process.

Building trades unions have started to speak out in favor of maintaining IRA tax credits for clean energy. Salvaging as many of these unionized projects as possible will be important to lay the groundwork for progress in the future under more favorable political conditions. Beyond the bread-and-butter gains for union members, positive experiences on these jobs can garner deeper political buy-in for green jobs going forward.

With roughly 60 percent of proposed IRA projects located in Republican districts, the fight over the IRA presents an opening to build unlikely coalitions in places conventionally viewed as hostile toward progressive environmental policy.

State-level coalition work helped build momentum for the passage of the IRA in the first place, and states will continue to be important battlegrounds over the next four years. Labor unions have an opportunity to aggressively mobilize their membership to defend good jobs, and environmental activists should join them.

IRA Labor Policy

The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment. Instead, it relies on tax credits to entice private investment in clean energy development. Relying on capital to make investments for the public good is always a shaky gambit.

Despite these limitations, some of the tax credits were cleverly designed to encourage the use of union labor. Companies receive a 30 percent tax credit if they pay their workers a prevailing wage for their region. More importantly for the building trades, companies also need to hire a designated number of union apprentices. These apprentices receive paid classroom instruction and on-the-job training.

It’s hard to deny that the legislation, whatever its limits, has been putting union members to work. Ethan Link, assistant business manager for the Southeast Laborers’ District Council, told Heatmap that it’s been like “night and day” since the passage of the IRA. Solar developers are proactively reaching out to the union about working together on projects. This has set off a virtuous cycle where, as a result, the union is investing in more solar training for apprentices.

The Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council was able to double its apprenticeship program as a result of the IRA. Kent Miller, the union president, believes that IRA incentives made Wisconsin’s four biggest utilities agree to employ union labor on all future clean energy projects.

Similar examples can be found across the country, from the growth of union offshore wind jobs off the coast of New England to a slew of wind and solar projects in Illinois.

The tax credits supported over $220 billion in manufacturing investment, and manufacturing employment increased by about 750,000 during the Biden administration. In March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that construction job openings were up by 111,000 from last year.

The GOP Attacks, Labor Speaks Out

The early drafts of GOP budget proposals reveal a party intent on derailing this progress. The House Ways and Means Committee put forward a plan to begin phasing out the clean energy tax credits in 2029 and have them completely expire in 2032. Under the current IRA law, the tax credits would expire in 2035, but only if greenhouse gas emissions went below 25 percent of 2022 levels.

More perniciously, the proposal essentially kneecaps the tax credits by changing an important provision. Currently, a project only needs to begin construction by a certain year to qualify for the tax credit. But Republican lawmakers want to require that projects be “placed in service” before 2032.

This change will hurt nuclear and geothermal energy development the most, since these projects require long-term planning, investment, and construction. If anything, this proposal will benefit short-term solar developers, the sector Republicans claim to dislike the most. The Trump administration is further destroying its own stated ambitions for nuclear energy (which is heavily unionized) via its Department of Government Efficiency–inspired assault on the Department of Energy.

Divisions over the IRA among Republicans have been brewing for a while, however. Many GOP lawmakers cannot ignore the investment and job growth the bill has already brought to their states. In August, eighteen House Republicans sent a letter to House speaker Mike Johnson imploring him to leave the tax credits in place. Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.

As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created. Last month, the Maine Building and Construction Trades Council hosted a press conference to highlight the growth of clean energy jobs in the state and demand that Congress hold on to the tax credits.

According to the Maine Labor Climate Council, there are 145 utility-scale projects in operation or development across the state that are eligible for the tax credits. “Mainers across the state have benefited from these important investments, from ironworkers building wind farms in Aroostook County to electricians installing battery plants in Lincoln and Gorham to the many solar fields spread across the state,” said Kilton Webb, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 567.

James Harrison from the Utility Workers of America penned an op-ed in the Detroit News about the development of the region’s largest battery storage facility. The project shows that these jobs can maintain the standards of the fossil fuel jobs that came before them.

“The new clean energy jobs that are coming to our community need to be as good as the coal jobs were, with family-supporting wages and good benefits. I have hope that we can get there due to the historic clean energy investments that are coming through the Inflation Reduction Act,” Harrison wrote.

More union leaders are recognizing that the clean energy transition is not a pipe dream; it’s already creating jobs, and the IRA was the key. “My fellow members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 46 in Western Washington are buying their first homes or getting out of debt after a job on a new clean energy project,” wrote Nicole Grant, IBEW Local 46 political director in Washington, in the Seattle Times.

The IRA became a labor bill almost as much as a climate one. As divisions over the Republican budget continue, a window of opportunity has emerged to build a coalition of labor and environmentalists to defend union jobs. Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.

Through the tireless work of organizations like the Climate Jobs National Resource Center, powerful labor climate coalitions at the state level have formed over the last decade. Despite the unfavorable political environment nationally, states can continue to make progress toward the development of more unionized clean energy jobs. Activists can start now by working to preserve the best of the IRA.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/17173009/GettyImages-1244828341.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 23:03:30.597519

When President Trump returned to office in January he signed a pair of executive orders freezing selected grants under these programs.","The past week was “Infrastructure Week” and if that jogs something in your memory about the first Trump administration, bingo.

In his first term, President Trump raised the idea of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan — at one point raised to $2 trillion — but time after time grand announcements were followed by — nothing. “Infrastructure week” became a running joke.

However, the state of the nation’s infrastructure is no joke and there was a bipartisan desire to actually get something done after decades of neglect. Thus, in 2021, President Biden signed the $1.2 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

Along with the Chips Act and the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, they formed the Holy Trinity of Bidenomics.

When President Trump returned to office in January he signed a pair of executive orders freezing selected grants under these programs. His “Unleashing American Energy” order was all about fossil fuels and an attempt to stop grants supporting renewable energy.

Angst and lawsuits followed. In April, federal Judge Mary McElroy ruled these grants had to be unfrozen. Executive orders can’t undo Congressional appropriations. Little by little, grants announced, but not obligated. started to move.

The backlog is substantial at more than 3,000 grants and Republicans have not missed the opportunity to criticize the Biden administration’s management.

For example, states were to receive $5 billion to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations nationwide by 2030. As of February this year, when the Trump administration froze the program, $3.3 billion had been allocated but only $40 million had been spent and precious few chargers had been built.

Note that the president froze the electric vehicle charger program before he held a publicity event for Elon Musk’s Tesla cars on the White House lawn.

However, that program and many others are an illustration of the problems that now confront the Trump administration: Federal agencies that don’t cooperate; state governments that have varying degrees of competence and capacity; and the difficulty of working with a stew of local governments, private sector partners and local interest groups.

Rather than using the IIJA as a political cudgel to beat the already vanquished Biden administration, the Trump administration has an opportunity to demonstrate its managerial chops — though given its chaotic character no one should hold their breath.

It is also an opportunity for the president to take credit for any completed projects, which is a given.

At an “Infrastructure Week” event hosted last week by the American Society of Civil Engineers, West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, the chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, stressed the opportunity and challenge of implementing the IIJA.

High on her agenda is streamlining the permitting process, increasing the safety and reliability of surface transport and figuring out how to pay for a sustained effort to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure given that revenue from the federal gas tax is declining thanks to more fuel efficient cars and the increasing numbers of electric vehicles.

ASCE puts out an annual report grading the nation’s infrastructure, and in its March report there was good news and bad news. The good news is that the overall grade was the highest it has been since 1998. The bad news is that the grade is C.

Illinois has already received billions from the IIJA and should receive more. There is a good deal to do. The ASCE report notes that 41% of the roads in Illinois are rated as poor or fair condition and that its grades for roads, drinking water and transit systems are all D-.

Can we find the better bipartisan angels of our nature to get some work done?

This story was reported by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powerful interests stalling climate action.

As an ice storm slicked roads across eastern Michigan on February 6, representatives from four houses of worship arrived at the offices of Democratic US Sen. Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs. Powered by renewable energy, the hubs offered residents shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan—and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne executive director Steve Wasko says his organization—which provides meals, clothing, daycare, and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood—has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels, and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States—including in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia—that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills—a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for nonpayment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15 percent of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households—roughly 23 million people—struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major US cities, including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15 percent or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14 percent of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades, despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump’s administration has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored.

The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist—and perhaps even deepen. “The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see.

Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44 percent of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45 percent of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70 percent between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45 percent—and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods.

“I think 70 percent or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit. Programs in 24 states and Washington, DC, support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one—the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa—is dedicated to low- and medium-income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50 percent of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief—only 9 percent of it is shaded, compared to 20 percent of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate-income households. “We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand. “Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Los_Angeles_redlining.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-05-18 18:04:25.256216

According to a Wall Street Journal report, GM told staff in an internal email, “We need your help!”GM warned that aggressive emissions rules could hurt business by limiting consumer choice and making vehicles less affordable. Employees were encouraged to contact senators using talking points aimed at revoking a waiver that lets California set its own stricter emissions standards.

How the Wheels Have Turned

That same California rule was once backed by GM, which had pledged to sell mostly electric vehicles by 2035. However, market conditions have shifted significantly since GM committed to that plan. EV demand has cooled considerably. Sales of electric vehicles fell 5% in April, while overall U.S. car sales jumped 10%, according to Motor Intelligence. EVs now make up just 7% of the market nationwide.

In California, the EV leader, zero-emission vehicles currently account for about 20% of new car sales, far below the 35% target the state set for 2026. Rising costs, fewer discounts, and the potential loss of federal tax credits make EVs less appealing to price-conscious buyers.

Even GM has had to dial back its ambitions. It scrapped its plan to build 400,000 EVs by mid-2024, delayed the launch of a new Buick EV, and postponed opening an electric truck factory. Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA), and Toyota (TM) have also slowed their EV rollouts.

Carmakers Rally Against ‘Unrealistic’ EV Mandates

Still, GM says it’s committed to electric vehicles and continues to invest in new models. A company spokeswoman said GM supports one consistent emissions standard nationwide that considers actual market demand. The lobbying push included workers in Michigan and other key states where lawmakers’ offices reportedly had received calls from GM employees.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major carmakers, is backing GM’s stance. It warns that California’s goals are unrealistic and could lead to job losses.

Supporters of California’s waiver say the state’s geography and environmental challenges justify stricter rules. But some Democrats, even from states with the ban, are starting to push back. They say the timeline is too ambitious and burdens consumers.

As one Long Island Toyota and Lexus dealer put it, EVs remain out of reach without subsidies. “The customers just aren’t there.”

and analysis of the writer:

As the summer travel season kicks off, thousands of Arizonans are hitting the road, many in vehicles still running on dirty fossil fuels like gas and diesel. But many of us travel cleaner, quieter, and smarter thanks to electric vehicles. I’m one of them, and I can tell you firsthand: Once you experience the benefits of driving electric, there is no turning back.

While EVs are a key way to help Arizonans save money on fuel and maintenance, the current Trump administration has missed the opportunity to make these cost-saving solutions more accessible. Fortunately, the available federal tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) make it more affordable for consumers to switch to cleaner transportation, including up to $7,500 for qualifying EV purchases. I purchased my used pollution-free electric vehicle and proudly display my Arizona “Clean Air — Blue Skies” plate. It’s more than a license tag — it’s a sign of pride.

While these tax credits have helped people make the leap, these incentives, along with federal EV infrastructure grants from the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that support building out public charging stations in Arizona, are now in limbo. The grants, which include the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, are designed to make EV charging more accessible, reliable, and widespread.

Arizona was allocated $76.5M through the NEVI program, but the current administration’s funding pause is delaying key projects statewide and putting the next phase on hold. Some of the communities impacted by the delay include Payson, Show Low, Lake Havasu City, Maricopa, Overgaard, Fort McDowell, Page, Bisbee, Douglas, Sierra Vista, Superior, Wickenburg, and Bullhead City, among many others. These rural communities have long lacked EV charging stations. Located near highways and transit stops, these stations would serve historically disadvantaged areas and expand access to clean transportation. Without urgent leadership, Arizona risks losing momentum and leaving rural communities behind.

As more Americans consider switching to electric, we need confidence that a reliable charging network is growing with demand. I’ve noticed improvements in public charging recently, and networks opening up to other brands (like mine) has been a game-changer. But we’re not done yet.

In Arizona, where long commutes, rural highways, and range anxiety make EV infrastructure even more critical, these federal investments mark the difference between progress and falling behind. Ensuring consistent funding and timely rollout of charging stations is essential for building trust and making EV adoption more appealing.

Driving an EV helps me save money. In Green Valley, I power my home and charge my EV with solar panels — something the IRA also supports with a 30% IRA tax credit for installation. That means virtually no fuel costs, even as gas and electricity prices rise, especially during the hot summer. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, EV drivers can save as much as $14,500 in fuel costs over 15 years.

With smart planning tools like PlugShare and my car’s built-in navigation, I’ve taken 1,000-mile road trips with ease. The ride is smooth, the drive is quiet, and best of all, it’s affordable — plus, my wife and I feel good knowing we’re contributing to a cleaner, healthier future.

For those still hesitant about EVs, especially in rural areas, technology has made finding chargers easier than ever. However, expanding access depends on continued federal investment. With more support, charging could become second nature, no matter where you live. That’s why we need Arizona lawmakers to accelerate, not stall, funding for pollution-free vehicles and EV infrastructure.

Let’s not lose our momentum. According to the American Lung Association’s State of the Air 2025 report, 84% of Arizonans live in areas with unhealthy air — yet 62% of voters support investing in charging infrastructure and incentives to make electric vehicles more affordable.

As we celebrate National Clean Air Month, take advantage of IRA programs and tax credits that support cleaner air, healthier communities, and greater energy independence. Visit PlugInAmerica.org/arizona to learn more about pollution-free vehicles and EV tax credits.

As Kit Miller and her husband got closer to retirement, they started thinking about how to save money.

They installed solar panels on their roof and watched their energy bills go down.

“We’re seeing a drop. Maybe 15 to 20%,"" she said.

She installed a solar energy system, paid for by a loan from Genesee Co-Op Federal Credit Union.

Dan Apfel, the credit union’s COO, says it’s part of a program helping small businesses and low-income homeowners make clean energy upgrades, which could lower their overall energy costs.

“The grant money we get to support lending,” said Apfel. ""It really can help make loans affordable for people so they can save money day one.”

The money is supposed to come from a $10 million grant from the EPA as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. But Apfel says those funds are now frozen.

“Unfortunately, the EPA and Lee Zeldin, they don’t want to disperse the money,” Apfel said. [They say] it doesn’t meet the current administrations polices. But we really think families can benefit from the money.”

Th GGRF was set up in 2022 as part of the inflation reduction act. It allocated $27 billion to the EPA for clean energy projects that would lower greenhouse gas emissions.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin released a video about cuts to the GGRF.

Genesee Co-Op is one of 108 credit unions across the county affected by the funding freeze. Currently, access to the money is tied up in court. An appellate court is expected to decide by late May whether EPA has the authority to terminate the awards. It’s a decision that could affect thousands.

“Higher income people have been able to afford this for a while through tax credits,” said Apfel. ""They can afford the cost of the loan but lower income people really haven’t been able to access this.”

I’m not used to this much luxury in a car (but I could easily get used to it). I’m driving the Escalade IQ Luxury 2 for a week. The following is a brief first-take review.

Size: It’s a luxury yacht on wheels

As a yardstick, I’ll compare it to two other giant high-profile electric vehicles, the Cybertruck and GMC Hummer EV.

Tesla Cybertruck (AWD): ~18 feet (length) / 6,600-6,900 lbs (weight)

GMC Hummer SUV EV: ~16.4 feet / 8,500 to 9,000 pounds

2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ: ~18 feet (length) / 9,300+ lbs (weight)

Speed / torque: don’t let the size fool you

Before the IQ arrived, I had just finished a test drive of the Cadillac Optiq, a compact crossover EV at the other end of the size/weight spectrum. So, I expected a step down in speed and torque. Nope. Despite the 9,000 pound+ weight and three rows of seats, the IQ keeps up with the much smaller (5,000-pound) Optiq. That’s with the acceleration features toggled on (Velocity MAX and sport mode). That was a surprise considering its size. Cadillac says the IQ does 0-60 in under 5 seconds. I believe it now. It produces 750 hp and 785 lb.-ft. of torque with Velocity Max.

Goodbye range anxiety

The IQ is rated at 450 miles of range. I have never test driven an EV with this kind of range. It changes everything. No more ABCs (always-be-charging) – a state of mind that afflicts every EV driver. And, when you do need a charge, the charging rates are very fast based on my testing at Tesla Superchargers. GM estimates 100 miles of range in about 10 minutes at a public DC Fast Charging station. So far, I’ve been charging at between 300 and 350 miles, so I haven’t gotten the rates that GM publishes. (With EV charging, when the battery’s charge exceeds 70-80 percent, charging rates drop off.) But even when I charged from 350 to the max of 450, it was fast. As fast as the rates on a Lucid EV I drove last year.

Public Charging: Tesla Supercharger heaven

The Escalade IQ I have came with a Tesla NACS adapter. I’ve been charging exclusively at Tesla Supercharger stations. Pure plug-and-play, i.e., you plug in and it just works. As a rule, I avoid Electrify America (when I can) based on years of frustration.

Sumptuous luxury

Curved Pillar-to-Pillar LED Display: A 55-inch curved LED display makes navigating information much easier than other EVs I’ve tested.

AKG Studio Reference Audio System: The Escalade IQ offers an available 36-speaker AKG Studio Reference audio system.

Rear-Seat Entertainment: Dual 12.6-inch displays with streaming to keep rear passengers entertained.

Driving experience

Air Ride Adaptive Suspension & Magnetic Ride Control: this adjusts the vehicle’s height and damping for handling various driving conditions. And Four-Wheel Steering improves maneuverability at low speeds and stability at high speeds.

GM Super Cruise Vs Tesla Full Self Driving

I’ve tested the most recent Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) updates 3 times in the past two months on the new Tesla Model Y “Juniper"" and once on the Cybertruck. Tesla’s FSD is amazing. It’s basically a robotaxi = the driver is the passenger. The problem is, it’s not flawless. That always makes me a little nervous – and I’ve had few mishaps with FSD in the past. I like the middle ground that GM has settled on with Super Cruise. GM leaves the local driving to you while offering true hands-free driving on the highway. Once you’re on the highway, Super Cruise will handle steering, acceleration, braking, and lane changes. In my testing of the IQ’s Super Cruise on Los Angeles highways, it does 90 percent of the driving on 118, 405, and 5.

Why is Super Cruise important?

Think of Super Cruise as a tedium reliever. Let’s say you’re taking a long trip that involves hours of yawn-inducing highway driving. That’s where Super Cruise takes over. It does the dull driving for you. I know people who have resisted any kind of driver assist until I explain to them what it’s for. Then they actually try it and are immediate converts.

China is gearing up for an electric revolution in its heavy truck sector, predicting that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up half of the market by 2028, a sharp rise from 10% in 2024.

What does this mean?

China’s push towards electric heavy trucks signals a seismic shift in its transportation and energy sectors. The announcement by CATL, a leader in battery manufacturing, underscores the growing penetration of EVs, driven by innovations like battery-swapping technologies. This transition threatens traditional fuel demand as LNG trucks also gain traction. CATL’s new facility in Shandong is pivotal, showcasing a 60 gigawatt-hour leap in energy storage and EV battery production. This plant is crucial to building Shandong’s 100 billion yuan lithium battery industry, poised to invigorate the local economy while enhancing China’s position in green technology.

Why should I care?

For markets: Recharging economic dynamics.

The shift to electric heavy trucks coupled with LNG alternatives presents mixed prospects for investors: opportunities in EV technology may invigorate markets, while oil and traditional fuel sectors could face headwinds. As Shandong becomes a battery hub, the region's economic landscape might attract new investments and potentially drive growth in related industries.

The bigger picture: Electric aspirations on a grand scale.

China’s ambitious target to electrify its heavy truck fleet echoes broader global trends towards sustainability.

And that happens at every traffic light, every intersection… We are sure you have also wondered why you paid for something they sold you as a “wonder”. Well, we have good news for you: the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) wants to eliminate the federal incentives that pushed half the planet into having this annoying system that has nothing to do with protecting the environment, which is what they claimed at first.

This was announced by the EPA Administrator himself, Lee Zeldin, with a message that leaves no room for doubt: “Where your car dies at every traffic light so companies can boast about being eco-friendly… The EPA approved it, everyone hates it, so we are going to fix it”. That’s it. Here’s the full story!

What is Start-Stop and why does everyone hate it?

The invention was very simple: when the car stops, the engine turns off. As soon as you release the brake or press the accelerator, it starts again. The idea was to reduce emissions and save fuel, especially in the city. But does it really work? Most people hate it because it delays the reaction time for quick starts, the air conditioning loses power, and of course, the starter motor suffers more than it should. Not to mention that actual fuel savings are minimal.

Almost all cars come with this system enabled by default. So, if you don’t want to be “stopping and starting” at every light, you have to manually disable it every time you start the car. Annoying, right? Hence so many complaints.

Where does it come from?

This start-stop technology became popular supposedly to save fuel, and it spread across Europe and the United States during the Obama Administration. Although it was not mandatory to include it, its use became widespread because federal regulations incentivized its implementation in vehicles.

But… does it really save anything?

According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Start-Stop can reduce consumption by 7% to 26%, but beware: this depends on traffic conditions, and for the most part, it only saves fuel during city trips with frequent stops. If you drive on highways, the system is practically useless.

Why does the EPA want to eliminate it now?

This initiative from Zeldin is part of a broader review of the regulations affecting the automotive industry. Basically, they are looking to eliminate measures that, in practice, do not provide significant benefits to consumers.

On social media, the proposal has been met with applause. Most comments agree, appealing to common sense.

The beginning of the end for Start-Stop?

Hopefully. Although the system is not mandatory by law, federal incentives made almost all brands include it as standard, and it is very annoying. If the EPA removes those “bonuses,” manufacturers will likely stop installing it in large numbers.

However, Zeldin’s proposal has sparked a bigger debate: do these regulations really benefit the consumer? Isn’t it time to listen more to those who actually buy the cars?

For now, Start-Stop has its days numbered. And many drivers won’t miss it.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/epa-stop-start-rollback-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 12:10:44.236784

IRA Labor Policy The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment.
Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.
As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created.
Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.","“It’s unfathomable to us. Unfathomable. In the history of our union hall, 134 years, we’ve never even come close to these numbers.” Trent Mauk, a training specialist at the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) in Michigan, said these words to Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein just over a year ago.

Mauk was referring to the massive growth in membership the union experienced thanks to the construction of two new electric vehicle battery plants. These plants were a direct result of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022. Before the IRA, UA members had to travel for work and experienced long bouts of unemployment. After its implementation, their apprentice program jumped from fifty trainees to almost two hundred.

With its reputation as an ambitious climate bill, it’s easy to overlook the IRA’s role in creating opportunities for unions in the clean energy sector. The building trades, often unfairly portrayed as uniformly opposed to climate action, have seen a substantial number of real jobs materialize for their members. This has translated into more general political support for clean energy development.

Key components of this legislation are now under threat as Republicans close in on their goal to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a $4 trillion tax cut for the rich. Paying for this primarily through cutting social programs like Medicaid is proving politically complicated. Republicans are now setting their sights on IRA tax credits, many of which are directly responsible for creating union jobs, as an area for cuts in the budget reconciliation process.

Building trades unions have started to speak out in favor of maintaining IRA tax credits for clean energy. Salvaging as many of these unionized projects as possible will be important to lay the groundwork for progress in the future under more favorable political conditions. Beyond the bread-and-butter gains for union members, positive experiences on these jobs can garner deeper political buy-in for green jobs going forward.

With roughly 60 percent of proposed IRA projects located in Republican districts, the fight over the IRA presents an opening to build unlikely coalitions in places conventionally viewed as hostile toward progressive environmental policy.

State-level coalition work helped build momentum for the passage of the IRA in the first place, and states will continue to be important battlegrounds over the next four years. Labor unions have an opportunity to aggressively mobilize their membership to defend good jobs, and environmental activists should join them.

IRA Labor Policy

The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment. Instead, it relies on tax credits to entice private investment in clean energy development. Relying on capital to make investments for the public good is always a shaky gambit.

Despite these limitations, some of the tax credits were cleverly designed to encourage the use of union labor. Companies receive a 30 percent tax credit if they pay their workers a prevailing wage for their region. More importantly for the building trades, companies also need to hire a designated number of union apprentices. These apprentices receive paid classroom instruction and on-the-job training.

It’s hard to deny that the legislation, whatever its limits, has been putting union members to work. Ethan Link, assistant business manager for the Southeast Laborers’ District Council, told Heatmap that it’s been like “night and day” since the passage of the IRA. Solar developers are proactively reaching out to the union about working together on projects. This has set off a virtuous cycle where, as a result, the union is investing in more solar training for apprentices.

The Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council was able to double its apprenticeship program as a result of the IRA. Kent Miller, the union president, believes that IRA incentives made Wisconsin’s four biggest utilities agree to employ union labor on all future clean energy projects.

Similar examples can be found across the country, from the growth of union offshore wind jobs off the coast of New England to a slew of wind and solar projects in Illinois.

The tax credits supported over $220 billion in manufacturing investment, and manufacturing employment increased by about 750,000 during the Biden administration. In March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that construction job openings were up by 111,000 from last year.

The GOP Attacks, Labor Speaks Out

The early drafts of GOP budget proposals reveal a party intent on derailing this progress. The House Ways and Means Committee put forward a plan to begin phasing out the clean energy tax credits in 2029 and have them completely expire in 2032. Under the current IRA law, the tax credits would expire in 2035, but only if greenhouse gas emissions went below 25 percent of 2022 levels.

More perniciously, the proposal essentially kneecaps the tax credits by changing an important provision. Currently, a project only needs to begin construction by a certain year to qualify for the tax credit. But Republican lawmakers want to require that projects be “placed in service” before 2032.

This change will hurt nuclear and geothermal energy development the most, since these projects require long-term planning, investment, and construction. If anything, this proposal will benefit short-term solar developers, the sector Republicans claim to dislike the most. The Trump administration is further destroying its own stated ambitions for nuclear energy (which is heavily unionized) via its Department of Government Efficiency–inspired assault on the Department of Energy.

Divisions over the IRA among Republicans have been brewing for a while, however. Many GOP lawmakers cannot ignore the investment and job growth the bill has already brought to their states. In August, eighteen House Republicans sent a letter to House speaker Mike Johnson imploring him to leave the tax credits in place. Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.

As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created. Last month, the Maine Building and Construction Trades Council hosted a press conference to highlight the growth of clean energy jobs in the state and demand that Congress hold on to the tax credits.

According to the Maine Labor Climate Council, there are 145 utility-scale projects in operation or development across the state that are eligible for the tax credits. “Mainers across the state have benefited from these important investments, from ironworkers building wind farms in Aroostook County to electricians installing battery plants in Lincoln and Gorham to the many solar fields spread across the state,” said Kilton Webb, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 567.

James Harrison from the Utility Workers of America penned an op-ed in the Detroit News about the development of the region’s largest battery storage facility. The project shows that these jobs can maintain the standards of the fossil fuel jobs that came before them.

“The new clean energy jobs that are coming to our community need to be as good as the coal jobs were, with family-supporting wages and good benefits. I have hope that we can get there due to the historic clean energy investments that are coming through the Inflation Reduction Act,” Harrison wrote.

More union leaders are recognizing that the clean energy transition is not a pipe dream; it’s already creating jobs, and the IRA was the key. “My fellow members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 46 in Western Washington are buying their first homes or getting out of debt after a job on a new clean energy project,” wrote Nicole Grant, IBEW Local 46 political director in Washington, in the Seattle Times.

The IRA became a labor bill almost as much as a climate one. As divisions over the Republican budget continue, a window of opportunity has emerged to build a coalition of labor and environmentalists to defend union jobs. Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.

Through the tireless work of organizations like the Climate Jobs National Resource Center, powerful labor climate coalitions at the state level have formed over the last decade. Despite the unfavorable political environment nationally, states can continue to make progress toward the development of more unionized clean energy jobs. Activists can start now by working to preserve the best of the IRA.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/17173009/GettyImages-1244828341.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:03.935441

The EPA said on Wednesday it will weaken some of the limits that were put in place under former President Joe Biden last year to minimize PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Precautions experts suggest taking

“The news of weakening the PFAS regulations was truly a betrayal to all communities,” Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist with the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG), told Nexstar. “Nobody wants PFAS in their drinking water, and it’s important for everyone to voice their concern to their elected officials that rolling back drinking water protections is harmful.”

Stoiber added that, while regulatory mandates may shift, it’s always good to know what is in your drinking water. People who get their water from a private well may want to get their water tested, Stoiber said, especially if the home is near an area with PFAS contamination.

Residents who get their drinking water from a municipal supply can also have it tested, either by a county health department or a state-certified laboratory, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Homeowners can call the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 or by visiting www.epa.gov/safewater/labs for additional testing resources.

Stoiber and others at EWG have been maintaining a ZIP code-searchable database with the environmental group’s findings from samples collected between 2021 and 2023.

“Once you know what contaminants are in your water, it will help you to select an effective water filter,” Stoiber said. “One of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce your exposure to environmental contamination is to filter your drinking water. Reverse osmosis and activated carbon filters are most effective for removing PFAS.”

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science has advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels has become clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

“One hundred percent, California is targeted,” said Mary Creasman, chief executive of the nonprofit California Environmental Voters.

While the Clean Air Act issue is complicated, other battles may be simpler.
Beyond defending itself in the courtroom, California can also use legislation to go on the offensive, according to Creasman, of California Environmental Voters.","Less than six months into his second term as president, Donald Trump has initiated or proposed more than 150 actions that experts say are detrimental to the environment, which range from cancelling climate grant programs to loosening regulations that govern air and water quality.

Many of these actions have been part of the president’s larger goals of reining in government spending, increasing energy independence and restructuring federal agencies. But some also appear to target one state in particular: California.

Long known as a nationwide leader in climate and environmental policy, the Golden State has been in Trump’s crosshairs since his first administration, when he sparred with Gov. Gavin Newsom over issues such as forest and water-supply management. In recent months, Trump has escalated his California-specific efforts, including vowing to block the state’s ability to set strict tailpipe emission standards — a battle that has wound all the way up to the Senate.

Many of the president’s actions in the first 100 or so days of this administration have not only called out California by name, but also disproportionately targeted it. A leaked list of pending program cuts from the Department of Energy includes 53 projects in California — more than any other state — as well as more projects in blue states than red ones.

In April, the president named California in an executive order directing the Department of Justice to seek out and “stop the enforcement of” state laws that address climate change, in which he described California’s first-of-its-kind cap-and-trade program as an unfair means of punishing businesses for their use of fossil fuels.

Experts say it’s not surprising that the president is coming for California’s environmental progress. Trump received record donations from oil and gas companies during his campaign. Meanwhile, California, a Democratic stronghold, has set aggressive climate targets that seek to limit those industries and transition the state to carbon neutrality by 2045.

“One hundred percent, California is targeted,” said Mary Creasman, chief executive of the nonprofit California Environmental Voters. “It’s along the same lines as everything we have seen from this president: political retaliation at every turn toward anybody who disagrees with him on anything — and California disagrees with him on a lot.”

But California also has the tools, means and motivation to to fight back, Creasman and others said, including through litigation and legislation.

Already, the state has filed or joined nearly 50 legal actions against the current administration, at least seven of which pertain to the environment.

Among them is a lawsuit challenging the president’s declaration of a national energy emergency, which calls for for increased fossil fuel production, waived environmental reviews and the fast-tracking of projects in potentially sensitive ecosystems and habitats.

“These procedures misuse authorities meant for disaster response and bypass important health and environmental protections for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta wrote in a statement about that case.

Bonta has also joined a lawsuit against the administration’s plans to freeze federal funding for a number of programs that Trump has disparaged as “woke,” including environmental measures. Other suits challenge attempts to claw back funding for the construction of electric vehicle charging stations across the country; wind energy development; and the AmeriCorps program that deploys young people to disaster-relief organizations.

The California attorney general has also joined a motion to defend the Environmental Protection Agency’s chemical-accident safety rules from state and federal efforts to weaken or repeal it, and has signed onto an amicus brief opposing mass federal layoffs at agencies such as the EPA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

State lawmakers — including Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla — have thrown their hats in the ring as well, penning letters to the heads of various agencies in opposition to climate grant cuts at the EPA, the closure of the federal disaster tracking system and other issues.

Such challenges are a critical line of defense for California and other states working to preserve climate progress, said Pete Maysmith, president of the League of Conservation Voters, a D.C.-based nonprofit advocacy group.

“We have to litigate, we have to organize, we have to win elections,” Maysmith said. “We need our champs in Congress — many of whom call California home — to stand up and fight against things like trying to revoke the clean air waiver that California has had for 50 years.”

Indeed, the battle over clean air waivers is among the state’s most ferocious fights so far.

For decades, California has been granted special authority to set its own vehicle-emission standards by utilizing waivers issued by the EPA. Clean Air Act waivers have been fundamental to the state’s efforts to limit greenhouse gases and transition to electric vehicles, such as its ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

But Trump has moved to block the state’s authority to do so, and earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives agreed with him. Now the battle is set for a vote in the Senate, which could happen as soon as this week.

Cliff Rechtschaffen, a member of the California Air Resources Board, believes the president is targeting the state in part because of its special authority.

“I think California stands out because we are the leader on so many things, including our clean car and zero-emission vehicle standard,” Rechtschaffen said. Should California lose the Senate battle, the state will challenge it in the court system, he said.

California can achieve a similar outcome without the waivers, Rechtschaffen said, such as raising registration fees or imposing taxes on heavily polluting vehicles — a tactic deployed in Norway that resulted in nearly all new cars purchased there last year being electric vehicles.

California could also consider instituting a statewide “indirect source” rule that would require ports and other facilities to limit pollution in the surrounding area, which could, for example, compel trucking companies using those ports to deploy low- or no-emissions vehicles.

While the Clean Air Act issue is complicated, other battles may be simpler. That includes Trump’s bid to halt the state’s cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and allows them to sell “credits” for unused emissions to other companies.

Experts say he does not actually have the authority to end California’s program.

“It’s not really something that Trump or the attorney general can do. If you want to stop the enforcement of state law, you have to go to court, and that’s the jurisdiction of the court,” Maggie Coulter, a senior attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, said about the executive order.

Rechtschaffen agreed, noting that the state does not need federal authority to maintain a cap-and-trade program. Neither the EPA nor Congress has created a national cap-and-trade program that preempts state programs, “so it’s completely lawful under state law, and I don’t see anything under current federal law that would threaten our program,” he said.

Beyond defending itself in the courtroom, California can also use legislation to go on the offensive, according to Creasman, of California Environmental Voters.

The state is already flexing its legislative strength with two 2023 laws slated to go into effect next year. Senate Bills 253 and 261 will require large corporations that do business in California to measure and publicly disclose their carbon emissions. Creasman said the laws leverage California’s market size to help push national policy, and could be a model for similar efforts in the future.

Another law winding through the state legislature, Senate Bill 684 — known as the “Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act” — would require fossil fuel polluters to pay for their share of damages and disasters caused by their emissions. The funds would be put toward projects and programs to prepare for and respond to climate change.

“As we see the federal government starting to shrink resources, ‘Polluters Pay’ is a really important mechanism,” Creasman said.

Should the federal government succeed at rolling back protections under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and other rules, California could also consider a concept known as “trigger laws” to restore state standards set under the previous administration, Creasman said.

Trigger laws become enforceable only by specific events or conditions. One recent prominent example was when several states used the laws to trigger immediate abortion bans in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.

This combination of weapons in California’s arsenal — litigation, legislation and a large economy — mean California can mount a good defense when it comes to the environment, Creasman added.

Director of Transportation Tom Vander Woude ran through changes in an update of last year’s Unified Planning Work Program, which outlines information about transportation spending. Among the language changes were removing tasks associated with climate change. And rather than referencing executive orders that relate to issues like environmental justice, the document now refers to the original legislation that prompted the executive orders that had been issued.

President Donald Trump’s flurry of executive orders so far this year have reversed previous presidential edicts aimed at preventing climate change or promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

Gary Councilwoman Lori Lathan, newly appointed to the commission, kick-started a discussion of how the agency can continue to push for things like air quality improvement without referring to climate change or otherwise running afoul of Trump’s edicts.

“When they say advice, is that something that we’re required to make those changes,” she asked.

“Do we have to do them? Yes, we kind of do,” Vander Woude said, because those federal agencies oversee grants.

Various memos and formal communications with the U.S. Department of Transportation, all contracts and grant agreements have to comply with the new standards, he said.

Latham asked why the NIRPC document approved Thursday would refer to the legislation instead of executive orders.

The executive order related to environmental justice, for example, was rooted in civil rights legislation from the 1970s, Vander Woude said, so the document can refer to discrimination based on that legislation.

Congress makes laws; executive orders deal with how agencies implement them but don’t reverse the laws themselves.

Regarding climate change, NIRPC will focus on air quality rather than climate change.e

Under the Biden administration, there had been a movement for greenhouse gas analysis, but that since has been stopped by the Trump administration, so NIRPC and other agencies can’t do that anymore, Vander Woude said.

If organizations like NIRPC can’t enact programs to protect constituents, who will, Beverly Shores Town Council President David Phelps asked.

Lake County Surveyor Bill Emerson Jr., who chairs NIRPC’s Environmental Committee, said a resolution proposed by his committee and unanimously adopted at the meeting addresses this issue.

The resolution, on page 380 of a massive agenda packet for the meeting, noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had announced the cancellation of over 400 grants, the effects of which are still being figured out.

The resolution says NIRPC “reaffirms its commitment to protecting and improving environmental quality of life in Northwest Indiana including, but not limited to, improving air quality including greenhouse gas reduction, community tree planting initiatives, brownfield redevelopment, environmental justice capacity planning and natural hazards readiness planning.”

Vander Woude said even though the bulk of NIRPC’s work involves channeling federal funds for local governments in Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties, the agency also serves as a council of governments.

NIRPC can still pursue those activities without using federal funds to do so, Executive Director Ty Warner said.

Impacts like resiliency, previously directly tied to climate change, can still be examined. “The issues related to resiliency persist regardless of where they can be tied to climate change,” Vander Woude said. “You can deal with the impact; you can’t necessarily draw it back to that.”

That’s getting the job done without semantics getting in the way, Porter County Council President Andy Vasquez said.

“I think that’s exactly what we’re trying to do,” Vander Woude said. “We can describe it in various ways, but ultimately it’s about moving forward our vision, our values.”

“I think we’re going to have to be creative if we’re going to maintain our environmental justice and social justice focus,” Chesterton Councilman Jim Ton said. “If you don’t proceed with some of this, it’s going to be gone forever.”

That’s focusing on the end result without attributing it to causes, Warner said. “We’re focusing on the end result, not any ideological issues.”

NIRPC deals with local priorities as well as federal priorities, Vander Woude said. “We’re responsive to both.”

“I personally don’t see substantial changes in the actual work being done,” he said.

Lake County Councilman Randall Niemeyer urged the commission to focus on the nuts and bolts and stay out of the weeds on this issue. “It’s more window dressing than anything with the rhetoric,” he said. Focus on projects that have good results for the region, he said.

May 18, 2025 - By Mark Olalde - Days after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency sent an email to the entire workforce with details about the agency’s plans to close diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and included a plea for help.

“Employees are requested to please notify” the EPA or the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s human resources agency, “of any other agency office, sub-unit, personnel position description, contract, or program focusing exclusively on DEI,” the email from then-acting Administrator James Payne said.

No employees in the agency, then more than 15,000 people strong, responded to that plea, ProPublica learned via a public records request.

Trump has made ending diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs a hallmark effort of his second term. Many federal employees, however, are declining to assist the administration with this goal. He signed an executive order on his first day back in office that labeled DEI initiatives — which broadly aim to promote greater diversity, largely within the workplace — as “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” and ordered them halted. His pressure campaign to end DEI efforts has also extended to companies and organizations outside the government, with billions of dollars in federal funding for universities frozen as part of the fight.

Corbin Darling retired from the EPA this year after more than three decades with the agency, including managing environmental justice programs in a number of Western states.

“I’m not surprised that nobody turned in their colleagues or other programs in response to that request,” he said, adding that his former co-workers understood that addressing pollution that disproportionately impacted communities of color was important to the agency’s work. “That’s part of the mission — it has been for decades,” Darling said.

Payne’s note to agency employees listed two email addresses — one belonging to the EPA and one to the Office of Personnel Management — where EPA employees could send details about DEI efforts. ProPublica submitted public records requests to both agencies for the contents of the inboxes from the start of the administration through April 1.

The Office of Personnel Management didn’t respond to the request, although the Freedom of Information Act requires that it do so within 20 business days. The agency also did not answer questions about whether it received any reports to its anti-DEI inbox.

The EPA, meanwhile, checked its inbox and confirmed that zero employees had filed reports. “Some emails received in that inbox did come from EPA addresses but none of them called out colleagues who were still working on DEI matters,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement in May.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

“The optimist in me would like to believe that maybe it is because, as an agency, we are generally dedicated to our mission and understand that DEIA is intrinsic in that,” a current EPA employee who requested anonymity said. “On the flip side, they’ve done such a good job immediately dismantling DEIA in the agency that folks who are up in arms might have just been assuaged.”

Although DEI programs are often internal to a workplace, the administration also put a target on environmental justice initiatives, which acknowledge the fact that public health and environmental harm disproportionately fall on poorer areas and communities of color. Environmental justice has been part of the EPA’s mandate for years but greatly expanded under the Biden administration.

Research has shown, for example, that municipalities have planted fewer trees and maintained less green space in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of people of color, leading to more intense heat. And heavy industry has often been zoned or sited near Latino, Black and Native American communities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was confirmed in late January, has boasted about cutting more than $22 billion in environmental justice and DEI grants and contracts. “Many American communities are suffering with serious unresolved environmental issues, but under the ‘environmental justice’ banner, the previous administration’s EPA showered billions on ideological allies, instead of directing those resources into solving environmental problems and making meaningful change,” he wrote in an April opinion piece in the New York Post.

The EPA spokesperson said employees with more than 50% of their duties dedicated to either environmental justice work or DEI were targeted for layoffs. The agency “is taking the next step to terminate the Biden-Harris Administration’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Environmental Justice arms of the agency,” the spokesperson said.

EPA environmental justice offices worked on a range of initiatives, such as meeting with historically underserved communities to help them participate in agency decision-making and dispersing grants to fund mitigation of the carcinogenic gas radon or removal of lead pipes, Darling explained.

“A sea change isn’t the right word because it’s more of a draining of the sea,” Darling said. “It has devastated the program.”

We agree — repealing these tax credits is a direct threat to Iowa’s economy, workforce, and energy security.

Here in Iowa, those very same clean energy tax credits are already delivering results. They’re helping small businesses in Fairfield cut costs, giving farmers near Ames tools to improve their bottom line, and training electricians in Sioux City for high-skilled, good-paying jobs. They’re putting solar panels on barns, boosting local economies, and keeping family energy bills manageable — all while building a more stable power grid.

A recent study commissioned by the Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits will support more than 2,300 jobs in Iowa every year through 2032 — that’s $116 million in wages and nearly $240 million added to our state’s economy annually. And these jobs aren’t just short-term. They include long-term careers in manufacturing, engineering, transportation, and energy operations for Iowans.

It would mean higher costs for families and businesses — projecting a 7% to 10% increase in energy bills by 2026, according to national projections. It would slow job growth, shrink opportunity, and make us more reliant on the same fossil fuel volatility that’s cost Iowa consumers and businesses dearly in the past.

When you combine clean energy with traditional power sources, you get lower costs, fewer price spikes, and more energy resilience in times of extreme weather that strain our power grid. The clean energy tax credits help to make this resilience and economic prosperity happen; it’s about having a diverse energy mix that works better for everyone while boosting local economies.

Clean energy is now one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the country and it’s helping keep young people in Iowa by offering skilled, meaningful work in their own communities. These investments are not red or blue. They’re just smart policy.

We know how to lead here in Iowa. We’ve led the country in wind energy, 13 GW, and are now charting a path forward in solar, storage, and other technologies. We innovate. We adapt to emerging technologies that uplift working families. And when we see something that’s improving the lives of our neighbors, families, and friends, we don’t tear it down — we build on it.

This is a critical moment to continue building for the future. Congress has the power to either preserve the momentum we’ve created and safeguard clean energy tax credits that enable Iowa to prosper or send our state back to a time with more expensive energy and fewer job opportunities for young Iowans, and shrink a burgeoning high-skilled industry. We urge Iowa’s representatives to protect these tax credits, support our clean energy workers, and keep Iowa’s economy charging forward.

Add it all up, and the Reconciliation bill is a bad deal for our country.","The “One Big Beautiful Bill” moving through the United States House of Representatives is being advertised as an economic engine, but that rhetoric masks its reality.

The current bill text would grind our economy to a halt by stealing 830,000 jobs by 2030, costing America more than $1 trillion in GDP by 2034, and increasing power prices 50% by 2035 according to new Energy Innovation analysis of energy-related provisions of the 2025 House Reconciliation bill.

By killing off existing clean energy tax incentives, Congress would kneecap our ability to build new power generation fast enough to meet soaring energy demand. Electricity demand is forecast to increase up to 15.8% in the next four years, with 128 gigawatts of new load expected on the grid as the AI race heats up. But the Reconciliation bill text would force expected clean energy capacity additions to fall dramatically – 114 GW by 2030 and 302 GW by 2035 - right when we need it most.

Warning signs are flashing for our economy: Inflation is rising and 82% of Americans are already worried about a potential recession. Clean energy is what’s available right now, and it cuts costs for families and businesses. But this bill would destabilize our economic competitiveness and set us back years against China and other economies to meet rising global demand for energy technologies.

America’s economy and families simply can’t afford this bill.

America’s Manufacturing - And GDP - Could Fall Off A Cliff

Last week, the House of Representatives released its 2025 budget Reconciliation legislation. Bill text passed out of several committees would repeal existing clean energy tax credits, claw back unobligated funding, expand oil and gas leasing, repeal certain Clean Air Act programs.

The sum of these parts would weaken our economy, not strengthen it, primarily by targeting existing clean energy tax credits passed by Congress in 2022. To date, these credits have generated $321 billion in new private investment across nearly 2,400 domestic clean-energy facilities, representing 4.7% of all U.S. private investment in the first quarter of 2025, with an additional $522 billion in private sector investment announced but not yet spent across more than 2,200 facilities.

The current Reconciliation legislation undercuts these 7,000 projects, risking billions in investments, dampening economic growth, eliminating jobs, and raising energy bills for people and businesses. Just the threat of repeal has already led investors to cancel $6.9 billion worth of projects between January and March 2025.

If the bill’s changes were fully implemented, that manufacturing growth would fall off a cliff as developers would cancel a significant number of announced clean energy manufacturing facilities, dramatically decreasing clean electricity generation deployment – costing America $1.1 in lost GDP between the budget reconciliation window of 2026-2034. That’s even worse than simple Inflation Reduction Act repeal.

Clean energy investment was worth $2.1 trillion in 2024, and while America’s clean energy economy has boomed since 2022, ceding this economic opportunity by killing off a fast-growing industry will hand that investment and jobs growth to competitors like China and the European Union.

Reconciliation Risks An Energy Crisis And Massive Job Losses

Losing out on all that clean energy manufacturing and deployment doesn’t just harm our overall economy, it also cuts off our ability to build new generation fast enough to meet electricity demand that’s surging due to data centers, manufacturing, and electrification.

The Reconciliation bill would dramatically decrease power generation capacity additions, costing the country 114 GW of new clean energy generation by 2030 and 302 GW by 2035, risking an energy crisis when we need new power more than ever.

Clean energy is the fastest option for utilities to meet rising demand – it composed 90% of all new capacity added to the grid in 2024, with solar and battery storage alone making up 84% of all new generation and renewables hitting 17% of total U.S. electricity supply.

But while gas has risen to become the nation’s largest source of electricity at 40% of total generation, new gas plants face massive hurdles to coming online because turbine manufacturers facing delivery backlogs until at least 2029. “To get your hands on a gas turbine right now and to actually get it to market, you’re looking at 2030 or later,” said John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra, one of America’s largest utilities.

And don’t forget jobs. The combination of cancelled manufacturing facilities and cancelled clean energy projects would cost our economy more than 830,000 jobs in 2030 and nearly 720,000 jobs in 2035. Not only would manufacturing and construction jobs disappear, but all the related jobs that depend on people working would suffer too – think the restaurant serving lunch, the stores selling uniforms and tools, and the destinations where those workers spend their vacations.

American Families And Businesses Forced To Pay More

But the real economic danger lurking in the Reconciliation bill’s text is the price American families and businesses would have to pay.

Decreased clean energy generation plus higher fossil fuel prices from increased gas exports and oil demand would force consumers to pay more than $16 billion more in annual energy costs in 2030 and more than $33 billion more in 2035 – an average of $120 more per year for American households in 2030 and $230 per year in 2035. Meanwhile fuel and operations and maintenance costs for businesses would spike $65 billion in 2030 and $94 billion in 2035.

This would all happen even if the Reconciliation bill increases U.S. oil and gas production and fossil fuel prices decline. Price reductions from higher fuel production are more than offset by greater demand for those fuels and higher electricity costs, forcing households to pay more for their energy. More internal combustion engine vehicles on the road means more demand for gasoline and diesel, while increased reliance on burning gas to generate electricity tightens supplies – on both, higher demand increases prices.

And while gas has been relatively cheap in recent years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts gas prices will rise 91% by 2026 with “additional risk over the forecast period” from new liquefied natural gas exports.

Even new clean energy would become more expensive due to the Reconciliation bill’s proposed tax credit changes, as utilities and power market operators are forced to pay more for new generation, passing that increased cost directly through to consumers.

A shocking 34% of U.S. households had to cut back or skip necessary expenses in the past 12 months to pay energy bills, while 23% have been unable to pay part of all of their energy bill during the same time. Todd Brickhouse, CEO of North Dakota’s Basin Electric Power Cooperative, told Congress the “removal of [tech-neutral energy tax credits] will not allow utilities to plan for and avoid increased costs, and this will also immediately harm ratepayers.”

Reconciliation: One Big Beautiful Bill America Can’t Afford

With inflation rising, American households simply can’t afford another hit to their budgets. With a recession looming, American workers can’t afford to lose good jobs. And with tariff-induced trade wars on the horizon, American companies can’t afford to lose our domestic supply chain.

To meet this challenge, we must adopt energy policies that align with the conservative principles that have made our state the greatest in the nation: reducing costs for consumers, fostering job creation and ensuring energy independence.

As we work to bring manufacturing and energy production back home, we must prioritize smart clean energy tax policy that delivers results. These measures help grow our economy, drive private investment and ensure greater energy security for consumers, businesses and especially our military.

Smart tax policy helps spur significant investment in our state’s economy. Florida is rich in renewable energy potential, and the state has a growing clean energy economy that has generated tens of billions of dollars in statewide investment, over 40,000 jobs and billions of dollars in household income. Companies are establishing manufacturing facilities, creating high-paying jobs and strengthening our domestic supply chains.

In 2023 alone, clean energy employment in Florida grew by 5.9%, nearly 2.5 times faster than overall state job growth. Clean energy job growth in Florida has also consistently outpaced the broader economy for the last five years — proving that this sector is not only critical to reducing energy costs, but also to fueling stable, long-term employment across the state.

Florida is rapidly emerging as a leader in clean transportation. According to the same study, we are home to over 12,900 electric vehicle jobs. This marks a steady increase of nearly 18% growth over two years. These jobs are spread across manufacturing, maintenance, logistics and supporting services — creating opportunities not just in major metros, but in small towns and conservative districts as well. These aren’t abstract policy wins — they’re real jobs for real Floridians, driving innovation, reducing fuel costs and bringing advanced industries into our communities

At Conservatives for Clean Energy, we advocate for pragmatic, market-driven energy policies that strengthen our economy, protect consumers and modernize our infrastructure. Supporting pragmatic policies that support clean energy generation in our state is consistent with these values. These policies are not handouts; they are strategic investments that enable businesses to plan, invest and grow within our state.

As discussions about energy tax policy continue, it’s imperative that reforms prioritize business and market certainty. We must not undermine the key drivers that are revitalizing our economy and powering our future.

Protecting these investments is the conservative, pro-growth and America First approach. Let’s continue to build on that momentum — for our workers, our families and our future.

However, there could be significant potential for these workers to be retrained for positions in the renewable energy sector, based on their existing skills and experience. Further, taxing the oil industry could help provide the money needed to fund this move.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, when global oil production fell to a record low due to a decrease in demand coupled with widespread government orders to stay at home, oil and gas jobs began to decline. Several oil and gas companies went bankrupt during the pandemic, leading to a sharp decline in jobs. Meanwhile, oil companies began to invest heavily in advanced technologies, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, to allow operations to continue running with fewer workers.

Despite the increase in oil and gas output since the pandemic, jobs are still being cut across the sector. In the United States, while crude output soared, employment figures fell during five of the first six months of 2024 due to improved operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to continue as companies invest further in advanced technologies and efficiency improvements across the industry. In addition, the eventual global shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives will contribute to a reduction in oil, gas, and coal jobs as roles in the renewable energy and nuclear power industries increase.

A May publication from Oil Change International (OCI) suggests that making the U.K. windfall tax on oil and gas companies permanent could provide enough financing to help North Sea workers transition to jobs in the renewable energy sector. By cutting subsidies to oil and gas producers, enough money could be raised to spend on the transition to a low-carbon economy, the report states. Approximately $2.5 billion a year is required to support the retraining of oil and gas workers, as well as to establish new infrastructure and green jobs in a “just transition”.

The report suggests that $1.46 billion would contribute to developing the wind industry and creating new green jobs, while $585 million would be invested in adapting ports to make them capable of building and maintaining offshore wind turbines, and $432 million would go towards training oil and gas workers.

The U.K.’s windfall tax is a levy on oil and gas producers that was introduced in 2022 when oil profits were soaring. The Labour government has said that the tax, also known as the energy profits levy, will be extended to March 2030, instead of expiring at the end of 2025 as originally planned. The government increased the tax to 38 percent in November, much to the dismay of many oil and gas companies.

The recent report suggests that making the windfall tax permanent could raise as much as $2.66 billion a year. Rosemary Harris, a senior campaigner at OCI, stated, “Transitioning to a renewable energy economy is one of the greatest opportunities the U.K. has to create secure, well-paid jobs for energy workers and build a fairer future.” Harris added, “But right now, the government is failing to meet the challenges facing workers and communities. As jobs disappear and the cost of living soars, communities are being left behind. This plays right into the hands of those who wish to weaponise the government’s inaction for their own profits, under the guise of caring about workers.”

OCI also wants the government to close tax loopholes, such as the “carried interest” provision in capital gains tax, which allows private equity fund managers to pay a much lower investment tax rate than they would if they had to pay income tax on it. This could raise around $651.7 million a year, according to the analysis.

In May, the U.K. Energy Ministry Ed Miliband secured a Green Industrial Partnership with his Norwegian counterparts, Ministers Terje Aasland and Cecilie Myrseth. Miliband met with several energy companies to deepen bilateral relations and boost clean energy investment in the U.K. The Plan for Change, a partnership between the two European powers, outlines plans to develop new clean energy manufacturing jobs. It also supports the development of the U.K.’s renewable energy capacity, including offshore wind and grid development. Research suggests that closer cooperation on the clean energy transition in the North Seas could lower bills, create up to 51,000 jobs, and add up to $47.9 billion to the U.K. economy.

With fossil fuel jobs in decline, governments worldwide must prepare for a just transition, supporting the retraining of oil, gas, and coal workers to prepare them for roles in the clean energy sector. However, achieving this shift will require high levels of funding for retraining programmes and related infrastructure. Recent research suggests that, in the case of the U.K., financing could be raised by making the windfall tax on oil and gas companies permanent.

The U.K. government plans to extend its windfall tax on oil and gas companies to fund the retraining of fossil fuel workers for green energy roles.

A partnership with Norway aims to boost renewable energy investments, creating thousands of new green jobs.

Closing tax loopholes and reallocating subsidies could generate billions for a “just transition” to a sustainable energy economy.

With plans for a green transition, millions of workers in the oil, gas, and coal sectors have become concerned for their jobs, with news of massive cuts as the energy reliance in several countries shifts away from fossil fuels.

When I looked at the renewable energy space, I saw an industry at the intersection of several powerful forces: the environmental imperative, the financial fundamentals driven by falling technology costs, and the geopolitics around energy. But more personally, it brought together my two biggest passions: people and technology. I’ve always been deeply curious about the future and ‘what’s next’, how technology reshapes the way we live, and how people drive that change.”

Sonnedix owns renewable energy plants and sells electricity. The company develops, builds, and operates globally, primarily in solar, with storage playing an increasingly important role. Launched in 2009 with a 1MW project in Spain it now has 11,000 MW of controlled capacity around the world.

Clean energy commitment

Sixteen years ago, however, renewable technology was still in its infancy. Institutional capital was still in the process of maturing its understanding of the asset class, and the market was highly fragmented. The challenges were real, from navigating nascent regulatory frameworks and building trust in a technology that was not fully understood, to managing prices that still needed to be proven they would drop.

Guinand says: “We take a deeply responsible approach to our communities, the land we use, and how we produce energy. Today, we have over 11,000 MW of controlled capacity globally and in 2024 alone we produced enough renewable energy to power approximately 1.8 million households.

“We’ve also built a team of more than 650 people. I’ve always believed a big part of our job is to hire those who are smarter than us – you never want to be the smartest person in the room – and that’s how we grow.”

The hidden electrification infrastructure

Electrical cables might be the unseen component in many of these evolving industries, but they are nonetheless fundamental to the proper functioning of almost all new advances associated with modern life.

Eland Cables connects projects across the world’s burgeoning green power network, and power and control systems, equipment and infrastructure. Executive director JS Pelland has steered the company through a 400% growth in turnover over the last 10 years to over £300 million today. This growth has arisen predominantly from supplying power cables to industries as diverse as railways, renewable energy and data centers.

A former finance executive originally from Québec, Pelland moved to London and took over what was then an SME-sized electrical cable supply company as part of a management buy-out from an LSE-listed conglomerate nearly 20 years ago.

It was a meeting of minds and the start of a friendship with fellow board members that saw him join the business as an owner and director, beginning a journey of innovating and expanding what has become Europe’s fastest-growing cable supplier to critical infrastructure.

Its Cable Lab has become a center of technical excellence in the cable industry, working with clients that include Network Rail, BAA, Vodafone, Eurotunnel, Siemens and UK Power Networks on large-scale electrification and decarbonization projects.

Pelland says: “With the ongoing transition from burning carbon molecules to the transmission of electrons as a source of power, cable suppliers such as Eland Cables have been presented with a unique opportunity to collaborate with industry leaders on shaping the world’s changing power landscape. The future of our business is intrinsically linked to the pace of the 21st century’s technological advancement and adoption.”

New life for retired EV batteries

Second-life battery storage systems reduce diesel reliance in off-grid communities, enabling commercial and industrial organizations to manage peak demand and EV charging loads. Moment Energy, founded by four engineers who met while building electric racing cars at university, is repurposing retired EV batteries to address grid resilience and renewable integration challenges.

The company is on a mission to repurpose every retired EV battery by 2030 and is building North America’s first second-life battery gigafactory. Moment Energy partners with automakers and utilities to create circular economies, with systems already powering remote sites across Canada and expanding into grid-scale applications.

CEO and cofounder Edward Chiang’s conviction about energy reliability was solidified in 2018. He was working on nuclear energy research for the Canadian government near Ottawa when a tornado hit. “We lost power for 24 hours,” he says. “Witnessing the local grocery store discarding food, and the hospital powerless was a stark wake-up call that ignited my passion to ensure everyone has access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy.”

Clean energy for all

Moment Energy was launched in 2020. Beyond the drive for energy access, the team was also confronted by a significant environmental challenge: what to do with retiring electric vehicle (EV) batteries. “We discovered that only about 5% of these batteries were being responsibly recycled,” says Chiang. “This presented a clear opportunity to create a circular economy solution.”

He points out that EV batteries often retire from vehicles with significant remaining capacity; an average of over 80%. Instead of heading prematurely to recycling, which can be costly and complex, the company repurposes them into battery energy storage systems (BESS), which extends their useful life for another 10 to 15 years.

To date, the company has raised a total of $52 million, including a $3.5 million seed funding in 2021, a $20.3 million DOE grant, and a $15 million Series A in 2025. While its initial large-scale manufacturing expansion focuses on North America, its global vision is to enable all retired EV batteries to be repurposed by 2030, an opportunity driven by an estimated 953 GWh of available batteries.

Chiang says: “Our aim is to enable broader repurposing efforts, not only through our own manufacturing but also by providing our battery management system (BMS) technology to other companies as well as our certified battery testing services, which are crucial for EV battery repurposing. We believe that clean energy is a fundamental human right, and our team is committed to making clean, reliable, and affordable power accessible to everyone across the globe.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68299445c1b9e5774afe1ad0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-18 10:05:21.116853

The Central Iowa Power Cooperative — known as CIPCO — is one of Iowa’s participants in the Energy Star program.
On average, Energy Star appliances can save homeowners 20 to 50 percent on the monthly energy bill to operate that appliance, compared with standard appliance models, Martin-Schramm said.
He said Energy Star laundry machines typically use about 20 percent less energy and 30 percent less water than typical washers; Energy Star refrigerators are about 15 percent more efficient than the federal minimum standard.
“If Energy Star goes away, that push to make an ultra-efficient appliance might go away,” Slager said.","If the Trump administration ends the Energy Star program that for decades has clearly marked home appliances that meet energy efficient standards, consumers would have to do more legwork of their own to research products or risk paying higher utility bills.

Under his proposed federal budget, President Donald Trump is asking that Congress eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency’s entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The EPA did not confirm to reporters it was ending the program — CNN was the first to report it was, based on unnamed sources — but said the reorganization “is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.”

A home that buys Energy Star products can save $450 a year on energy costs, the program says. While energy efficient products would remain on the market if the program ends, it would fall to consumers to find them since they would no longer feature the familiar label. And incentives for manufactures to meet the standards could dwindle with the program’s demise, some energy experts predict.

Consumers “may give up and buy products with less efficiency that will cost them more in energy expenses,” said Tom Carsner, political director for the Iowa City Area’s chapter of the Sierra Club.

The IRS and local utilities rely on Energy Star’s standards for tax credits and rebates for purchasing efficient products could put “their future in doubt,” he said.

“Homeowners may be discouraged (from) buying heat pumps, solar panels or insulation without the standards that help them save money,” Carsner said. “It will cost consumers more and will further damage our environment.”

How the program works

Administered by the EPA, the Energy Star program works as a voluntary labeling program on appliances — with over 80,000 products earning the certification.

If an appliance meets efficiency standards set by the EPA, the manufacturer can choose to add an Energy Star logo. The designation means consumers and businesses can purchase the approved products to save energy.

Kerri Johannsen, energy program director with the Iowa Environmental Council, said the program has “filled a critical gap in consumer choice and information” since its inception in 1992 under the administration of then-President George H.W. Bush.

“The program also provides tools and standards for businesses, schools and local governments that want to keep energy bills as affordable as possible,” she said. “This is critical with rising electricity rates in Iowa, where many parts of the state are in the 90th percentile or higher for the portion of income they pay for energy.”

According to an April 2022 report from Energy Star, Iowa has about 120 businesses and organizations participating in the program that helps them become more energy efficient. Additionally, nearly 50,000 homes and apartments in Iowa are Energy Star-approved — scoring 75 or higher on a scale of 1 to 100 that shows how their energy consumption compares with similar facilities across the nation.

The Central Iowa Power Cooperative — known as CIPCO — is one of Iowa’s participants in the Energy Star program. While ending the program would not directly affect the cooperative, it would its members.

“We are participants in the sense that we support our member cooperatives in being participants,” said Kerry Koonce, vice president of communications and corporate relations for CIPCO, based in Cedar Rapids, a generation and transmission electric cooperative owned by 13 rural electric cooperatives and associations. A member — for instance, a rural electric cooperative — “would be the one that would be offering a rebate to somebody, if it was Energy Star.”

Local impacts

If the program were shuttered, Koonce said one of the biggest challenges for utilities and electric cooperatives would be educating customers.

“It'll take a re-education of people, of just things to look for so that you understand how to look at ratings and make sure they are energy efficient,” she said. “I think you would see more (education efforts) coming out, but some of that's going to come from the manufacturers, too, because they want to make sure they you buy their product.”

Alliant Energy spokesperson Morgan Hawk said the company “always encourages” customers to implement energy efficiency tips to reduce their energy usage and save on their bill.

Hawk said that a list of “do-it-yourself” cost savings tips can be found at alliantenergy.com/waystosave. He said that customers also are encouraged to monitor their energy usage and set up high-usage alerts through their Alliant accounts.

“In addition, Alliant Energy has been offering energy efficiency programs for customers for nearly 35 years,” Hawk said in an emailed statement.

He said customers can visit Alliant’s website and click on the “Ways to Save” tab at the top to explore a variety of options, including instant discounts, rebates and the Alliant Energy Marketplace with energy-efficient products.

Geoff Greenwood, spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy, said the company will “continue to closely follow developments relating to the timeline and scope of changes from the EPA to better understand any impact those changes could have on the energy efficiency programs that MidAmerican offers to customers.”

If the EPA follows through on shuttering the program, Jim Martin-Schramm, policy analyst in Winneshiek County with the Clean Energy Districts of Iowa, said low-income consumers would pay a price.

“In Iowa, approximately 25 percent of all ratepayers are low-income households getting by on incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level,” he said.

On average, Energy Star appliances can save homeowners 20 to 50 percent on the monthly energy bill to operate that appliance, compared with standard appliance models, Martin-Schramm said.

He said Energy Star laundry machines typically use about 20 percent less energy and 30 percent less water than typical washers; Energy Star refrigerators are about 15 percent more efficient than the federal minimum standard.

“It is hard to understand why the Trump administration would want to eliminate the Energy Star program, given that it simply provides consumers with valuable information and does not limit their choices in the marketplace,” Martin-Schramm said.

Tim Slager, president and owner of Slager Appliance, said that about 85 percent of the appliances in his three storefronts — in Iowa City, Cedar Rapids and Dubuque — are Energy Star-certified.

He said that since so many appliance models are Energy Star approved, not too many customers ask anymore about appliance efficiency. But a decade ago, before energy efficient thinking was mainstream, customers inquired about it much more often.

“If Energy Star goes away, that push to make an ultra-efficient appliance might go away,” Slager said.

“We just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there. That is functional,” Lego CEO Niels Christiansen told The Associated Press.

The iconic Lego bricks are made from oil-based plastic using a highly automated process which allows for outstanding repeatability and consistency, so the company continues to seek out sustainable alternatives, spending more than a billion dollars to do so—but it is not a simple task.

Siemens Mobility’s Commitment to Net-Zero Operations

New Piccadilly line trains for Transport for London, which will transform rail travel across the capital, are being assembled at the Goole site, before they start to enter service by the end of this year. Siemens Mobility also plans to build all future mainline trains for the UK at Goole, including new battery bi-mode trains that it has calculated could save Britain’s railways £3.5 billion and 12 million tonnes of CO2 over 35 years.

Finbarr Dowling, Siemens Mobility Director of Localisation, said: “Our vision from the very outset was for the Goole Rail Village to be net zero in its operations by 2030, with this state-of-the-art facility playing a central part in our mission to transform rail travel and transport in the UK. “This strategic focus has informed the development of a state-of-the-art rail cluster that leads the way on decarbonisation for the industry, with facilities that are streets ahead of many across the sector. It also underpins everything we do at Goole, ensuring that our buildings, energy generation and consumption, how we work, and travel to and from the site all minimise our carbon impact. That is hugely important for us, as a business committed to the highest sustainability standards, as well as to our customers, stakeholders and partners as they strive for excellence in environmental responsibility.”

Investing in Green Energy: Solar Panels and Energy Efficiency

Siemens Mobility’s investment of up to £240 million in the Goole Rail Village represents a significant commitment to the North of England, with the site featuring manufacturing, components, logistics, innovation, and office facilities, establishing it as a centre of excellence for rail technology in the UK. Global rail technology leader Siemens Mobility has installed 1,700 solar panels across the three manufacturing buildings at the Goole site, which have now been connected and are capable of generating up to 1MW of clean energy – the equivalent of powering more than 150 homes.

Sited on the trucking, final assembly, and commissioning buildings, the £2 million solar array covers almost 20,000 m2 (215,000 sq ft) of roof space and is producing sufficient energy to meet the site’s needs. Green energy produced by the panels during the site’s non-production hours, such as during weekends, is exported back to the grid, while any additional energy required during peak times is exclusively from renewable sources.

Sustainability Measures: Air Source Heat Pumps and Electric Vehicles

Siemens Mobility has set ambitious targets to reduce emissions in its own operations by 55 per cent by 2025, and 90 per cent by 2030, with the production of its own renewable energy at sites such as Goole playing a vital part in that transition. The solar array complements other sustainability measures which are contributing to the Goole site’s low carbon credentials. Siemens Mobility has invested £2 million to install more than 40 localised air source heat pumps to heat the production facilities at Goole, an initiative projected to cut its carbon output by 980 tonnes per year, an 88 per cent reduction. The business is also electrifying its vehicle fleet and rolling out EV charging points across the Goole site to ultimately install around 70 chargers, one for every 10 parking spaces. All employees are encouraged to adopt greener methods of transport, such as cycling, using public transport, or car sharing.

Future Investments and Job Creation at Goole Rail Village

The latest phase of the Rail Village will see the addition of a Bogie Assembly and Service Centre, representing an additional investment of up to £40 million, which means Siemens Mobility’s overall investment will total up to £240 million, bringing up to 1,000 new jobs to the site, as well as around 1,700 supply chain opportunities. David Harris, Siemens Mobility Construction Project Manager, said: “Our carbon reduction strategy for the Goole Rail Village has been implemented over a number of years. We’ve considered how best to minimise our carbon footprint at every stage, including throughout the development and construction phases. With the rail manufacturing facility now operational, we’re seeing the full benefits of building sustainability into the project from day one.”

Siemens Mobility’s Integrated Rail Hub: The Goole Rail Village

Overall, Siemens Mobility is investing up to £240 million in the Goole Rail Village, a site that spans 67 acres, the size of 35 football pitches. London Underground’s new Piccadilly line trains will be assembled at Goole before they start entering passenger service from 2025. This investment will bring up to 1,000 new jobs to the East Riding of Yorkshire, as well as around 1,700 supply chain opportunities, promoting localisation and helping to serve other global markets by 2030. The Goole Rail Village is a fully integrated rail hub, consisting of the Train Manufacturing Facility which assembles and commissions trains, the Components Facility where Siemens Mobility maintains gearboxes, traction motors, and other parts for train and tram fleets, the Logistics Centre warehousing facility, and the Rail Accelerator and Innovation Solutions hub for Enterprise (RaisE) business centre. With additional investment of up to £40 million, all of this will be joined by a Bogie Assembly and Service Centre, which will incorporate and expand Siemens Mobility’s current capabilities to overhaul bogies from UK trains.

Supporting Local Supply Chain and Yorkshire Businesses

Siemens Mobility has supported the local supply chain wherever possible, contracting Leeds-based GMI Construction for the build of the Goole factory, Components Facility, and the warehouse. The GMI supply chain is based entirely in the UK, with over 70% of it based in Yorkshire.

Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be ""shut down"" without government help over energy pricing.

Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose £100m this year, and it wants to invest £2bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.

The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.

The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.

It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in ""constructive discussions"" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.

The company is seeking a ""cap and floor"" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.

""What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock £2bn of investment,"" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.

""It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.""

Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned ""and we'll lose this resilience"".

He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.

""So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.""

A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, ""we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers"".

Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not ""materially"" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.

He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a ""huge economic opportunity"".

However he added that ""the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments"".

""Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.""

He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was ""very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target"".

""It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.""

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2260/live/7b57ca50-33ba-11f0-b50a-8f193c97c723.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 10:05:39.229305

Community arts projects and sports and recreation facilities could also receive funding.

The level of payments will range depending on the size of the infrastructure project - from tens of thousands a year for small farms up to millions for larger developments.

“If you live near an offshore wind or solar farm, your local community should benefit from supporting this nationally critical mission,” Mr Miliband told the Sunday Mirror.

“The Prime Minister’s mission to become a clean energy superpower is creating good well-paid jobs in these areas, building the infrastructure we need to get energy bills down for working people.”

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror during a visit to a solar farm in Hull, which entirely powers a local hospital during the summer, saving the NHS up to £200,000 a month, Mr Miliband said the government's plan isn't just about fighting climate change - it's about cutting bills.

“Here’s the way I think about this,” he said. “The public are with if you can combine action to create clean energy with tackling the cost of living crisis - and that is absolutely at the heart of our mission.

“Our mission is about cutting bills for people, cutting costs for people and transitioning to clean energy - not about raising people’s bills.”

He added: “We want this to work for people economically. This only works if it works for people economically. That’s our guarantee.”

Mr Miliband said the government’s clean energy mission was about “so much more” than climate change.",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35242851.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SOCIAL-Ed-Miliband.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 10:05:44.992014

""It is the farmer's land. It is the farmers' decision … on these matters,"" Gipson said. ""The concern is, at some point, how much is enough, and how (are solar projects) going to impact our long-term food supply and our agricultural backbone… .""

Gipson, who has led the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce since 2018, has at various times expressed concern with the development of agricultural land through Mississippi for non-agriculture uses.

Since 2017, the solar industry has grown rapidly in Mississippi, with more than $4 billion in private investment for dozens of projects throughout the state, as reported by the Clarion Ledger.

Gipson said specifically the state is doing little in the way of regulating those projects via permitting processes before they break ground.

""I think there needs to be a policy that makes sense,"" Gipson said. ""As it is, we've got 82 different counties with 82 different positions on what solar projects are needed … It's a patchwork situation that has given rise to a huge surge in these projects that are eroding our farmland.""

The state does, however, already regulate all energy generation projects. Notably, the state, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, requires air quality permits in addition to power plant regulations set forth by the Public Service Commission and other air- and water-quality regulations.

Projects do also need certain permissions from the Public Service Commission before a solar project can connect to the grid.

Senate chairman suggests adding suffrage bills to special session

During an interview about the more than 70 suffrage bills lawmakers failed to pass before ending the 2025 regular session early, a high-ranking senator said he would support the governor adding suffrage measures to an upcoming special session.

In the 2025 regular session, not one suffrage restoration request for those who have been disenfranchised for various felony convictions made it through both chambers.

Senate Judiciary B Committee Chairman Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, and several suffrage bill authors said it was a shame the Legislature didn't pass any suffrage restoration bills this year and pegged the outcome on political squabbles between House and Senate.

Fillingane also apologized to those who had lawmakers file those bills on their behalf and said Republican Gov. Tate Reeves does have the option to tack those measures onto the special session slated to happen by June 30.

In early April, the Legislature gaveled out the 2025 regular session early because of a stall on state budget negotiations. That stemmed mostly from debates over when the state's $7 billion budget should be hashed out, whether to use state dollars to fund local projects and if lawmakers should establish recurring revenue for the state retirement system.

In 2024, lawmakers passed a near-record number of suffrage bills after an effort to automatically restore suffrage to nonviolent felony holders died in the Senate.

Reeves, a Republican, has the power to call lawmakers back to the Mississippi State Capitol and vote on a new state budget, but he also has the power to add on any other item to the agenda and force lawmakers to consider.

A special session is one of the governor's most powerful tools to shape policy debates in the Legislature, but the process itself is costly. A special session taking place outside the Legislature's regular meeting schedule costs roughly $100,000 per day.

Reeves, because of that fact, has kept recent special sessions to one-day affairs for large economic development projects.

Reeves has said nothing is totally off the table for a special session. He also said he wants House and Senate leadership to have a finalized budget agreement before he calls them back in to vote, which as of May 14 had not yet happened.

Former Democrat Party chair dies

Former state senator Mississippi Democratic Party Chair Johnnie E. Walls Jr. died Saturday, May 10, according to an announcement by the state Democratic Party. He was 80.

A Clarksdale native, Walls Jr. served in the Mississippi State from 1993 to 2010 and then as a judge in the Bolivar County Circuit Court district from 2011 to 2016.

Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons in a Facebook post said Walls was a dedicated public servant.

""Judge Walls leaves behind a powerful legacy of integrity, wisdom and dedication to public service,"" Simmons said.

“Look for the Energy Star.” Most Americans know that is excellent advice to anyone appliance shopping. That little blue label saves American consumers roughly $40 billion a year in energy costs every year.

With the program’s modest price tag – less than one percent of the EPA’s total spending – Americans save a whopping $1,250 for every single dollar spent on Energy Star. And Americans know that little blue symbol means less wasted energy and cleaner air. It helps families stretch their paychecks and do right by the planet at the same time.

Since the Energy Star public-private partnership began in 1992, it has helped save American households and businesses more than $500 billion on energy costs. It has more than 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions (roughly the equivalent of annual pollution from 933 million cars). And it has done so while empowering consumers with better information – not by taking anything away. What that looks like at the local level is homes and businesses in a large city like Chicago saving $116.6 million a year in energy costs, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 539,500 metric tons.

Now, Donald Trump wants to get rid of it. Virtually no one thinks that would be wise.

In March, a large group of manufacturers and industry associations joined a letter calling on Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to keep the popular EPA program. The US Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, and others said, “eliminating [Energy Star] will not serve the American people,” and they pointed out that because of consumers’ high awareness of the program – to the tune of 90% brand awareness – the results if it is eliminated would be “decreased features, functionality, performance, or increased costs” of appliances.

Energy Star certified homes typically save around $450 per year on energy bills. In 2020 alone, the program’s emissions reductions amounted to more than five percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions. That year, the program’s energy savings also improved health outcomes for communities by preventing 210,000 tons each of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollutants, and 20,000 tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The public health benefits from those reductions in air pollution were estimated to be as high as $17 billion!

Further, the estimated annual market value of Energy Star product sales is more than $100 billion. And of domestic energy efficiency jobs, about 35% are in the manufacturing and installation of Energy Star products. As of 2020, that was more than 790,000 American jobs.

In his latest attack on common sense, Trump is trying to eliminate one of the federal government’s most successful, least controversial, and most popular consumer protection tools.

Ending Energy Star is not a serious policy move. It is performative politics at its worst. It is “virtue signaling” to fossil fuel extremists from a man desperate to please his donors while punishing regular people for choosing clean, affordable options.

Targeting the program as part of some sort of ideological deregulation agenda doesn’t even make sense because it is not a regulation. It does not force anybody to buy or produce anything. It is simply a voluntary, science-based labeling system. It helps consumers compare appliances and other products based on their energy efficiency. It helps Americans cut down their energy bills. And it helps reduce pollution that hurts our lungs and heats our planet.

That is why Americans across the political spectrum support it. It is an example of our government doing something simple, effective, and bipartisan. At least, it used to be.

Donald Trump’s push to dismantle this program is a perfect example of how MAGA hardliners have turned their backs on the very people they claim to represent. This is not about freedom or choice. It is about controlling the market to benefit fossil fuel interests. It is about keeping consumers in the dark. And it is about making sure families have fewer tools to protect themselves from rising costs.

Ask yourself: why, in the middle of what Trump and his allies keep calling an “energy emergency,” would you go out of your way to kill a program that helps people save so much money energy? The only people who benefit are the fossil fuel executives who profit when homes and appliances waste more of it.

When people waste energy because they unknowingly buy inefficient products, the fossil fuel industry makes more money.

That is the whole ballgame. It is a rigged system that leaves working Americans with higher bills while big polluters cash in. The Energy Star label helps consumers break that cycle.

Cutting Energy Star would be a betrayal of the millions of Americans who are already struggling to afford groceries, gas, and electricity. It would hurt seniors trying to stay warm in winter. It would hurt young families buying their first refrigerator. It would hurt renters in cities and homeowners in rural towns alike. No one benefits – except the lobbyists and the oil barons.

Energy Star gives every American the chance to choose better, smarter options. Scrapping it to score cheap points with the same special interests that are holding our country back defies common sense.

Americans deserve leaders who will fight to keep our bills low, our homes efficient, and our future sustainable.

Ben Jealous is the Executive Director of the Sierra Club and a Professor of Practice at the University of Pennsylvania.

Brad Little issued his own executive order in line with Trump’s, aiming to ramp up logging with the same “rationale” as the Trump order, combatting increased wildfire danger.
The order appears to replace federal responsibility for forest management in that of the state.
Decades of fire suppression by the USFS has led to a buildup of denser forests in some western dry forests.
The amount of timber sold from logging USFS lands in the U.S. from 2014 to 2023 has varied between 2.8 and 3.2 billion board feet a year.","On March 1, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production.” The order claimed “onerous Federal policies” have hindered domestic timber production and that expanding logging was a matter of protecting “national and economic security.” It ordered the secretary of the Interior and head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), who oversee the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) respectively, to develop a plan to expand timber targets and streamline permitting “to suspend, revise, or rescind all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and other agency actions that impose an undue burden on timber production.”

The responsible departments and agencies were instructed to find categorical exclusions to the National Environmental Policy Act and use “emergency regulations” to circumvent the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

After Trump’s order, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service continued the assault on endangered species by proposing a new rule that would redefine “harm” under the ESA to only include directly killing species, replacing the current definition that includes destruction of a species’ habitat. Habitat destruction is the greatest source of species extinction.

In April, USDA head Brooke Rollins directed the stripping of forest protections on more than half of all national forests and called for expanding timber production by 25 percent to address a “wildfire emergency,” and restore forest “resources.” A report from the Associated Press says the directive “exempts affected forests from an objection process that allows outside groups, tribes and local governments to challenge logging proposals at the administrative level before they are finalized.”

A map of forests Rollins has targeted includes all national forests in Washington State and California, and large sections throughout the west and other parts of the country. It even includes some wilderness areas. These forests contain some of the most cherished old-growth and mature forest ecosystems remaining in the U.S.

In the Pacific Northwest, millions of acres of older and mature forests and old-growth dependent species like the northern spotted owl were finally protected by the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in the 1990s after a century of logging that had reduced the forest to about a fourth of its historical extent. The NWFP happened as a result of intense forest defense and protest by Earth First! and many other environmental groups, studies by forest ecologists and court injunctions. The idea that these forests of immense trees, stunning natural beauty, rich biodiversity and crucial reserves of carbon sequestration could now, once again, be opened to logging is stomach-turning.

In late April, Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued his own executive order in line with Trump’s, aiming to ramp up logging with the same “rationale” as the Trump order, combatting increased wildfire danger. The order appears to replace federal responsibility for forest management in that of the state.

Jeff Juel, forest policy director for Friends of the Clearwater (FOC) said, “The state of Idaho has not earned the trust of the American public to manage forests while preserving old growth, assuring wildlife populations are robust and healthy, or maintaining hunting and fishing opportunities.… They are, on the other hand, experts at clearcutting and making state lands resemble a war zone.”

Trump’s order called for “forest management and wildfire risk reduction projects” to “save American lives and communities.” Yet none of the administration’s orders even gave lip service to the overwhelming preponderance of evidence that climate change is the main driver of more severe wildfire that has resulted in the destruction of whole communities in the west in recent years, including parts of Los Angeles.

Dominick DellaSala, chief scientist with Wild Heritage, whose stated mission is to protect and restore forests and safeguard biocultural diversity around the world, told Truthout that Trump’s policies are “a double whammy on the climate. By beginning the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, they’re going to continue to drill for fossil fuels and increase our emissions to the atmosphere. At the same time, they’re talking about an executive order that would increase logging on 280 million acres of forests across the U.S., bypassing the nation’s … landmark environmental laws, even the Endangered Species Act.”

DellaSala led an international team of scientists in doing the first nationwide mapping of mature and old-growth forests in the U.S. Their analysis found these forests sequester 9 percent of the nation’s total emissions.

“These big, fast-moving fires are the combination of extreme fire weather caused by anthropogenic climate change interacting with heavily logged landscapes. So it’s that double whammy again, by doing more logging and contributing to more emissions, you have a feedback on fire weather over the long run, that’s what’s really driving these big fires,” DellaSala told Truthout. “The latest climate attribute models are showing now that we can explain a lot of the causality around these big fires because of the increase in spring and summertime temperatures, especially heat domes, high winds and extreme droughts.”

As the Trump administration cited wildfire mitigation as a reason to increase logging to “save communities” from wildfire, it was busy axing programs, agencies and employees who were researching or seeking ways to combat the climate crisis driving increased wildfire. Trump also declared an “energy emergency” justifying elimination of government environmental regulations on energy production.

Wildfire Science and “Mitigation”

A growing body of knowledge in fire ecology understands wildfire is a natural phenomenon that ecosystems have evolved in relation to. Trees and plants have evolved strategies for flourishing with fire — such as conifers which have serotinous cones that require fire to open them so seeds are distributed.

Fire plays a key role in ecosystem restoration. It is increasingly understood among fire ecologists that a century of fire suppression in the U.S. has failed, and has been damaging in preventing fire from playing its role in maintaining forest health.

Traditionally, Indigenous cultures in the U.S. burned the landscape to control larger, more dangerous wildfires and to generate better growing conditions for native plants they harvested. Cultural burning is credited by most scientists as well as tribes with helping maintain healthy forest ecosystems and biodiversity.

A member of the Karuk tribe in California told CalMatters “Fire, for us, is not just a tool — it’s a lifeline, a means of renewal, and a vital part of our culture.” Indigenous burning was suppressed in California and in the U.S. as a whole in the 19th century by the government as part of destruction of Native culture, theft of land and genocide.

Wildland fire is a very complex phenomenon. Different types of forests have very different fire regimes. Degrees of fire intensity differ greatly between forests and even within forests of the same general type, depending on rainfall, climate, and other factors. Historically, fire intensity varied, even within forest patches.

Decades of fire suppression by the USFS has led to a buildup of denser forests in some western dry forests. In the era of climate crisis, this has contributed to more intense and widespread fires. There is basic agreement among scientists on the role of climate change as a prime driver that must be addressed. Many agree on the need to curtail fire suppression in the backcountry to help restore the natural function of fire on the landscape. Steps here include allowing certain backcountry fires to burn and to increase prescribed burning, especially during seasons of lower fire risk.

There’s also a clear need to develop programs for home hardening, vegetation clearing near structures and better escape plans for threatened communities.

But the science on using mechanical thinning of forests to manage wildfire is not settled. There is ongoing debate about how effective it is at lowering the severity of wildfire or its threat to communities. Disagreements remain over the degree and type of thinning that should occur, where and when it should be done if at all, if it should only be undertaken in tandem with prescribed burning and whether it is beneficial or harmful to the ecosystem.

Scientists do in general agree that if done, thinning should focus on dry forests, removing smaller trees and protecting more fire-resilient older and mature trees. A USFS study showed that older forests that have been protected from logging to preserve nesting area for the northern spotted owl under the NWFP can act as “fire refugia,” burning at lower intensity than surrounding landscape. A 2016 study in Ecosphere showed forests with high levels of protection from logging in dry and mixed-conifer forests burn with lower intensity than unprotected forests or those subjected to logging, even though they generally contain more forest biomass.

Forest Service Fuel Treatment

No matter the scientific debate, the reality is that over recent decades, government policy has largely continued to rely on fire suppression. This strategy has failed to lower the risks to communities or to save forested ecosystems. At the same time, the USFS has, in recent years, begun to use thinning and prescribed burning on hundreds of thousands of acres of land each year and has plans for tens of millions more.

Environmental groups that are watching this on the ground say some mitigation projects have been done more judiciously and can be helpful, but now a great deal of USFS projects are just clear-cutting of forests to produce revenue for timber companies.

Karen Coulter of Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project (BMDP), which works to protect and restore the ecosystems of the Blue Mountains and Eastern Oregon Cascades, told Truthout she has been monitoring public lands in eastern Oregon and southwest Washington for 33 years. She said in the 1990s, average timber sales were smaller-scale, legitimate commercial thinning. “Sometimes I could agree with it. Because it was thinning from below, and it wasn’t hacking down the large trees and so forth. It was more reasonable. Now it’s virtual clear-cutting, much more intense logging, and it’s on a landscape scale.”

BMDP’s website has many photos of USFS projects termed “free selection,” “commercial” thinning or “understory removal” in the Malheur and Umatilla National Forests that are essentially clear-cuts. Everything is mowed down. Some of these include old-growth trees.

Right now, the organization is contesting a USFS project in an Inventoried Roadless Area, (public lands without roads that have high conservation value), that includes Walla Walla, Washington’s, municipal watershed and old-growth trees. They say logging here could cause damage to water quality for the city and streams that support threatened salmon, steelhead and bull trout.

Nick Cady is the legal director with Cascadia Wildlands (CW) in Eugene, Oregon. CW works to defend and restore wild ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Cady told Truthout that another issue is often Forest Service proposals are turned over to timber companies to execute, giving them leeway. Meanwhile, he said the BLM is “just logging as much as they can.”

Cady said of USFS “mitigation” proposals, “If you log to maximize value, you dramatically increase fire risk. That is what the data on the ground has shown time and time again…. So if you say you’re going to maximize logging to improve fire, it’s just not real.”

USFS did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

In Montana, the Alliance For The Wild Rockies recently sued and stopped a USFS project planning to cut and burn 15,000-45,000 acres covering the whole eastern side of the Bitterroot National Forest over 20 years, claiming “categorical exclusions” from protecting threatened species.

The amount of timber sold from logging USFS lands in the U.S. from 2014 to 2023 has varied between 2.8 and 3.2 billion board feet a year. Expanding timber production by 25 percent would increase sales to 3.75 billion board feet a year from its current 2024 level of around 3 billion board feet.

Internal USFS documents obtained by WildEarth Guardians (WEG) show top officials under both Trump and former President Joe Biden have pressured foresters to streamline the process for timber sales. At a June 2017 meeting, the USFS leadership team for the Pacific Northwest said the head of USFS was calling to “increase our restoration activities” so as to “increase acres treated and volume output as a consequence.”

USFS has also been undertaking plans to revamp the NWFP in ways that would increase the cut of older trees. One proposal would, among other things, change the age of trees protected in wet forest Late Successional Reserves from 80 to 120 years, opening up 824,000 acres to logging. WEG says this would “eviscerate the entire concept of [the reserves] which were originally intended to provide large blocks of older forests for species like the northern spotted owl.”

What’s Next?

The Trump regime now threatens to worsen the devastation of some of our most important older forests, gutting the most fire-resilient ecosystems, increasing the threat of climate change and more dangerous wildfire. It does so while slashing environmental protections across the board and gutting key agencies and programs that offer some protection to humans and the planet.

Cady and Coulter both told Truthout that the regime is going to run into all kinds of problems with accomplishing their plan — shuttered lumber mills, previous legal decisions against timber interests in court and real difficulties with the process of designing these sales after firing thousands of forest service employees.

Cady said Cascadia Wildlands has “a massive body of supporters” that can be mobilized to act regardless of decisions in the courts. He said, “People live here, they don’t want massive amounts of logging.”

In cooperation with court challenges and active public engagement by these and other groups, forest defense efforts including active tree sits have increasingly jumped off in Pacific Northwest forests recently. These include two tree sits in southern Oregon on BLM land, one of which helped precipitate a court ruling canceling logging in the Poor Windy Project in May 2024. Another tree sit has just begun to protect legacy forest on Department of Natural Resource land in Washington State near the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula.

Coulter said what Trump’s order is attempting “would be illegal and challenged in court, but the problem is their strategy seems to be that they could wrench these destructive timber sales through first before there’s any final legal outcome. And this is kind of what they’re doing, is wrecking everything as fast as they can, dismantling the agencies,” she said. “We need to raise the profile of the forest defense movement…. We need to raise the profile of forests, along with everything else that they’re targeting.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1355168071-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 05:01:40.690782

AP National Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency came under bipartisan criticism Wednesday over his agency’s actions to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved spending to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country.

Nearly 800 grants were awarded by former President Joe Biden’s administration under the 2022 climate law, which directed the EPA to spend $3 billion on grants to help low-income and minority communities improve their air and water and protect against climate change. The law allocated another $20 billion under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.

Funding for both programs was abruptly terminated by the Trump administration in actions that Democrats have denounced as illegal and unconstitutional.

Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has illegally withheld, or impounded, climate-law funding despite a decades-old law that explicitly prohibits such actions by the executive branch. Repeated court rulings, including by the Supreme Court, support the power of Congress to set federal spending levels.

Zeldin’s budget maneuvers “endanger communities by making it harder to address pollution and climate chaos,” Merkley said at a hearing Wednesday.

Varied approaches to questioning the EPA chief

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chair of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the environment, also criticized Zeldin, saying funding freezes approved by his agency — including to grants intended for rural communities in Alaska — were “somewhat indiscriminate.""

Murkowski questioned whether severe budget cuts proposed by President Donald Trump were “serious.” Many of the proposals, such as an 88% cut to a state revolving fund for clean water, are likely to be reversed by Congress, she said.

The EPA’s approach under Zeldin is “problematic,” Murkowski added. “EPA has not adhered to our guidelines and has been largely unresponsive to questions,"" she said.

Zeldin told Murkowski she has a special phone number for his office and can call him any time.

His exchanges with Democrats were less friendly.

“So you understand that when you impound funds, you’re violating the law?"" Merkley asked Zeldin, a former New York congressman who took over at EPA in January.

“No, Senator, we are going to follow all statutory obligations,’’ Zeldin replied. “We absolutely disagree with you very strongly.’’

Asked under what authority the money was being withheld, Zeldin cited “policy priorities” under Trump that differ from Biden-era views.

“But it wasn’t the Biden administration that passed this law. It was Congress,’’ Merkley shot back. ”And so, this is in the law as written, and it’s signed by the president, and yet you’re defying it.’’

Zeldin said he rejected Merkley’s premise, adding, ""We couldn’t possibly disagree more strongly with what you’re saying.’’

If he can’t follow his oath of office, Zeldin should resign, Merkley said, a suggestion Zeldin immediately rejected.

Accused of trying to ‘burn it down’

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state said Zeldin and Trump shared an approach when it comes to EPA: ""Burn it down.’’

Money being withheld by EPA would pay for things like heat pumps to reduce energy costs and pollution, wildfire preparedness and infrastructure upgrades to protect drinking water from floods and earthquakes, Murray said. ""Blocking this funding is hurting communities everywhere,’’ she said.

Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff asked Zeldin why he had canceled a $19.8 million grant to Thomasville, Georgia, to replace a wastewater collection system and build a community health clinic.

“Is a new health clinic for Thomasville woke?” Ossoff asked, noting that the grant was approved under an environmental justice program the EPA has terminated.

Zeldin again cited policy priorities before Ossoff, a Democrat, cut him off. ""You hurt my constituents,’’ he said.

Zeldin later said grants to Thomasville and towns in Alaska and Washington state may be restored if language about environmental justice and diversity is removed, in accordance with an executive order by Trump.

Zeldin declined to provide specific goals for EPA staffing under his tenure, but appeared to acknowledge claims by Merkley and Murray that staff totals could return to a level last seen under former President Ronald Reagan. The EPA had fewer than 11,000 employees in 1983, compared to more than 15,100 in 2024.

The agency has laid off hundreds of employees and offered voluntary retirement or deferred resignations to thousands more as part of a broader effort by Trump and adviser Elon Musk to downsize the federal workforce.",https://waynetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zeldin-cpac-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 00:02:25.196633

The failed US administration is pulling every lever it can to keep the promises it made to the fossil fuel companies that paid to get it elected. EV purchase incentives? Gone. Level 3 charging infrastructure? Kaput. Tax credits for companies that manufacture batteries? History. Production credits for critical materials? Forget about it. The oilygarchs paid to get their guy elected and now they are cashing in. As a result, you might think the EV revolution in the US is over, but you would be wrong.

The latest Global EV Survey from the IEA shows the US is clearly falling behind virtually every other country when it comes to adopting electric cars, but there still were more EVs sold in America last year than the year before — although, admittedly, the percentage change was small. Now JD Power is out with its latest EV survey, which finds that the same amount of Americans — about 25 percent — are considering buying or leasing an EV this year as last year. Is that a big deal? It may not seem so at first, but when you consider all the negativity about EVs coming from the MAGAlomaniacs, it is good news.

In a press release on May 15 announcing the results of the survey, Brent Gruber, the executive director of the EV practice at JD Power, said, “Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration. To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable. Additionally, the industry should better educate consumers about EV ownership to ease concerns — many of which, such as those related to public charging, are less problematic than they might seem when it comes to actually owning an EV.”

Thanks for that, Ben. In fact, CleanTechnica has a whole section of its website that is devoted to educating people about charging and range concerns. Just a few days ago, we published an article about EV charging and range that was designed to answer some of the common questions people who have not yet made the move to battery-powered vehicles often have.

The JD Power survey found potential customers were a little less concerned about purchase price and cost of ownership this year than they were last year, but the perceived lack of charging infrastructure was still a concern for more than half of the people who participated in the survey. Younger people were more interested in buying an EV, while older Americans were less so.

“Much of the recent growth in the EV space has been fueled by products from mass market brands, which demonstrates the pent-up demand for more affordable products,” Gruber said. People in the Midwest are least enthusiastic about driving an EV, which Gruber attributes to concerns about cold weather charging and loyalty to traditional automakers.

Toyota C-HR EV Returns As AWD EV

Toyota has gotten fairly poor reviews for its inelegantly named bZ4X, which has been updated and is now simply called the bZ. (It’s still a stupid name.) Toyota announced recently it is bringing back the C-HR — a model that was quietly withdrawn from the US market a while ago due to poor sales. Now the model name is being resurrected for 2026, but the new car will be a battery electric with AWD, 338 hp, and a range of about 290 miles from a 67 kWh battery. That is pretty good, if true. The Chevy Bolt with the 65 kWh battery has a range of 265 miles. It will be interesting to see what the official EPA rating is when the car goes on sale.

The new C-HR shares the same e-TNGA platform used by the bZ. Toyota claims the C-HR will sprint to 60 mph in 5.0 seconds. It will have an 11 kW onboard charger, a NACS charge port, and a peak charging rate of 150 kW. Does that make the C-HR a standout? No, it does not, but it makes it a competent electric car that is little bit smaller than the bZ snd shares much of its interior with the larger model. Car and Driver says it should start at around $35,000, with the upmarket XSE trim beginning at around $38,000.

Affordable SC01 Sports EV Introduced In China

Have you ever dreamed of an affordable battery electric sports car that is about the size of Mazda MX5 (Miata)? If so, the JMEV SC01 introduced recently in China may be just what you are looking for. Backed by Xiaomi, the SC01 is similar in size to the Lotus Exige. The tube frame sports car solves the battery weight problem by stacking the battery behind the seats, much the way the Fiat X 1/9 or Lamborghini Miura placed the engine in those cars to achieve a nearly 50/50 weight distribution. The SC01 is actually an inch or so lower than the Miata and the seats are as low as possible in the chassis, thanks to the battery pack not being mounted beneath the floor as it is in most EVs.

The best part is that the SC01 will sell for the equivalent of $31,000 in China, according to InsideEVs, which claims the sporty EV will weigh just over 3,000 pounds (1,365 kg). It will have two electric motors, one for each rear wheel, with a combined output of 429 hp (320 kW). With its 60 kW NMC battery, the car is expected to have a range of 323 miles (520 km) as measured by the Chinese test cycle. Check out the video below for more about the SC01.

Hyundai To Manufacture EVs In Saudi Arabia

Finally in EV news from around the world today, Hyundai Motor Manufascturing Middle East announced in a press release on May 14, 2025, that its joint venture between PIF — the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — and Hyundai Motor Company has begun construction of the King Salman Automotive Cluster within King Abdullah Economic City.

PIF owns a 70% stake in HMMME, with Hyundai holding the remaining 30%. The manufacturing plant, Hyundai’s first facility in the Middle East, will roll out its first vehicle by the fourth quarter of 2026 and will have an annual production of 50,000 vehicles, including both conventional and electric vehicles. The partnership is one in a series of PIF initiatives designed to establish Saudi Arabia as a global automotive presence. Lucid also manufacturers its Air electric sedan in King Abdullah Economic City.

Wongyun Park, Vice President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Middle East, emphasized that HMMME is driving change and paving the way for a new industrial future in the region. “The facility will become a platform for growth and industrial excellence in the heart of the Kingdom.” Electrive reports the Lucid Air is assembled in Saudi Arabia from semi-knock-down kits manufactured at the Lucid factory in Arizona. There is no word on whether Hyundai will follow a similar strategy.

That completes our survey of EV news from around the world for today. What have we learned? Simply this: Despite the pigheaded policies of those in the US who want to drag the country backward into the 19th century, the EV Revolution is gaining momentum everywhere, even in America. Maybe it is taking a little longer to reach the tipping point many of us would like to see, but it is happening nonetheless. The future of transportation is electric, despite the best efforts of the fossil fuel industry and its stooges in government to hold back progress for one more month, one more week, and one more day.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Toyota-C-HR.png,N,,2025-05-17 22:59:55.193106

That's down from 7% of the average transaction price in March.
Prior to April, the six-month average was 7.4% of average transaction price.
Brand that led average transaction prices at $114,000 At General Motors, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands all posted higher average transaction prices in April compared with March, with little change to incentives, Cox reported.
April was the best sales month this year for both brands, pushing the overall industry average transaction price higher.","The average transaction price for new vehicles in April reached $48,699, a 2.5% increase from March and a 1.1% increase from April 2024.

Incentives offered by automakers decreased to their lowest point since the summer of 2024 as demand surged.

While tariffs on imported vehicles and parts are being implemented, some automakers are adjusting sticker prices, while others are holding steady for now.

As car buyers rush to get in front of tariffs — which are widely expected to boost sticker prices — the flood of demand has been pushing new vehicle prices ever higher, with the trend unlikely to stop any time soon, experts said.

In Cox Automotive's Auto Market Report published May 13, Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said the trend of rising prices continues into May.

“May so far looks like a continuation of April, with urgency to buy diminishing, but the retail vehicle market and the U.S. economy both holding up relatively well,"" Smoke said.

The job market is ""good enough so far,"" but hiring is slowing, Smoke said, noting that borrowing money to buy a car is getting more expensive. He said the number of low-interest rate deals has decreased by 7 percentage points year-over-year, with interest-free loans also declining.

Smoke's remarks come on the heels of a report from Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book published May 12 showed the average transaction price for new vehicles in April surged 2.5% to $48,699 compared with March. Prices rose 1.1% compared with April 2024. Cox said it was the strongest April sales since 2021.

The buying frenzy meant automakers did not have to offer big discounts. Cox said new-vehicle sales incentives fell to about $3,262, or 6.7% of the average transaction price. That's down from 7% of the average transaction price in March. Cox said incentives were at the lowest point since the summer of 2024. Prior to April, the six-month average was 7.4% of average transaction price.

'Pricing landscape is varied'

On April 3, President Donald Trump put a 25% tariff — the tax an importer pays on a good when it crosses international borders — on all imported vehicles to encourage more U.S. manufacturing.

Trump was set to then enact 25% tariffs on all imported parts starting May 3. But on April 29, the administration modified the tariffs on foreign auto parts. In a complex formula, the executive orders Trump signed will now allow automakers to be reimbursed for some of those tariffs for the next two years to give them time to find domestically sourced parts.

Still, a Michigan economics group, calculating tariff impact, has estimated that the least-impacted vehicles will still face a $2,000 tariff-induced price hike and the most impacted will see a $15,000 impact.

Cox Executive Analyst Erin Keating explained that new car prices are rising on the heavy demand to get the goods before manufacturer's suggested retail prices go sky high to offset carmaker's tariffs costs.

“Ever since President Trump announced auto tariffs 47 days ago, the cost of new cars has been steadily climbing,"" Keating said. ""Even though there was a surge in shopping and sales early on, the manufacturer’s suggested retail prices haven’t budged. The pricing landscape is varied depending on the automaker, car segment and specific models — some are cutting incentives, others are in high demand, and the supply isn’t evenly distributed across the board.”

Here's how it played out in April

Ford Motor Co. has been running a national employee-pricing program that started in early April and runs through July 6. The Dearborn-based automaker is relying on a message of “holding prices steady” and touting its “built in America” leadership.

Cox said Ford brand prices and incentives in April were mostly unchanged from March with one standout: The Maverick pickup, which Ford assembles in Mexico, saw lower prices in April. Ford's incentive spending on the Maverick increased to an all-time high of 6.6% of average transaction prices on record monthly sales of 20,183 Mavericks sold in April, Cox said.

In early May, Ford said it is hiking prices on three of its Mexico-produced models effective May 2, becoming one of the first major automakers to adjust sticker prices in response to tariffs. Prices on the Mustang Mach-E all-electric SUV, Maverick and Bronco Sport will increase by as much as $2,000 on some models.

Brand that led average transaction prices at $114,000

At General Motors, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands all posted higher average transaction prices in April compared with March, with little change to incentives, Cox reported. Buick, however, saw lower prices and higher incentives in April.

Import brands Acura and BMW also held prices lower and increased incentive spending last month compared with March.

In the ultraluxury segment, sales of Porsche and Land Rover models accelerated in April because both brands will face higher future costs given 100% of their vehicles are imported, Cox noted. The average transaction price for Porsche led the industry in April at above $114,000, with Land Rover just behind at $113,000. April was the best sales month this year for both brands, pushing the overall industry average transaction price higher.

Car buyers even flocked to all-electric vehicles last month. The Kelley Blue Book team initially estimates new EV prices in April to be $59,255, a 3.7% increase from the year-ago period and a 0.2% increase compared with March. Cox said the March EV average transaction price was revised lower to $59,132.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/10/PDTF/83033073007-041025-dfp-car-iventory-rg-01.jpg?crop=2399,1351,x0,y140&width=2399&height=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-17 21:04:35.527526

Dodge will launch gas-powered Chargers later this year.

Dodge is pulling the plug, so to speak, on its base model electric Charger Daytona, the R/T, as it deals with slow sales, but don’t expect what appears to be a limited-edition run of vehicles to turn into collector’s items, according to a key industry watcher.

“Rarity does not make a collectible. You need to have demand for it,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions. “You can’t presume that this will be a Charger Daytona of 1970. They couldn’t sell those originally and years later they were collectible.”

Fiorani said it’s risky to bet on a car of today becoming something that brings big dollars in the years to come, even when the numbers of those made and sold are relatively small.

Still, Dodge will continue to offer the more powerful and expensive electric Charger Daytona Scat Pack for the upcoming model year, even as it prepares to launch several gas-powered versions.

While it’s not clear how many Dodge Charger Daytonas will be produced this year, so far the sales picture is showing a fairly light impact. Electric Charger sales — the company did not distinguish between versions — for the first three months of this year were at 1,947. Granted, they were just beginning to arrive in showrooms in January after months of delays.

However, the automaker likely had higher hopes. Fiorani noted that he’d recently driven by a Dodge dealership and saw a row of Chargers waiting to be sold.

In a statement, Dodge CEO Matt McAlear said “production of the Dodge Charger Daytona R/T is postponed for the 2026 model year as we continue to assess the effects of U.S. tariff policies. The Charger’s flexible, multi-energy STLA Large platform allows us to focus on the Charger Daytona Scat Pack’s performance as the world’s quickest and most powerful muscle car, add the new four-door model to the Charger mix for the 2026 model year and lean into the new Charger SIXPACK models that will launch in the second half of the year.”

Sixpack refers to the engine, the inline-six Hurricane, which will come in 550-horsepower or 420-horsepower variants.

The current electric Scat Pack promises a peak power base of 630 horsepower with a limited push-button burst to 670 horsepower called the Power Shot. The Dodge website lists the Scat Pack all-wheel drive with a starting price of $73,985, excluding destination charge.

Adding gas-powered versions to the lineup is not a surprise, as Dodge had previously said that was the plan. However, the decision, reported earlier by MoparInsiders.com, to end the electric R/T’s run so soon does highlight how the market has changed, both in terms of the slower adoption of electric vehicles and President Donald Trump’s embrace of tariffs. The Charger Daytona is assembled at the Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, but the batteries initially were to come from South Korea.

Fiorani offered some perspective on the potential tariff impact, however.

“Everybody is leaning on tariffs for every change in production or sales, whether real or not,” he said.

Market realities are, however, what they are.

“The idea that an internal combustion engine version would hit the market better at the moment is a strong one,” according to Fiorani. “Buyers haven’t warmed up to EVs as a performance vehicle yet, especially since every EV is a performance model now.”

Fiorani noted also that the company's planned shift in production volume toward the gas-powered Charger would also take the focus off the less expensive EV version — the R/T was listed with a starting price of $59,595, not counting destination.

“(They) kind of want to focus on the vehicle that will make money versus the entry-level models that will sell on price,” Fiorani said.

The moves for Dodge follow news that Ram is also adjusting its electric plans. Crain's Detroit Business, citing a memo to suppliers, reported this week that the electric Ram 1500 REV would be delayed until summer 2027, a year later than what the automaker told the Free Press in January, and the extended range Ramcharger is being pushed from later this year to early next year.

The company, in a statement provided by spokesman Nick Cappa, cited ""slowing consumer demand for half-ton"" battery electric pickups and noted that ""we also are extending the quality validation period for the Range Extended Ram to support a successful launch and the highest build quality.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/12/07/PDTF/76839718007-img-2572.jpeg?crop=5711,3213,x0,y535&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-17 21:04:39.963638

Hopefully, Bollinger doesn't meet the same fate as Fisker and other recent startups, but it's not looking good.","A U.S. district judge has granted former Bollinger owner and CEO Robert Bollinger's request to put his former company into court receivership after its new owners failed to come to a meeting regarding an unpaid loan between the two parties, which is only the latest in a long string of disasters for the once-promising commercial electric truckmaker.

The company initially planned to produce the B1 pickup and B2 SUV, but its boxy creations have not seen the success of Rivian's R1T and R1S, despite being much simpler. They didn't even make production, so Bollinger pivoted to commercialization to survive, but even that doesn't appear to be enough to stop it from circling the drain.

Bollinger's History In Brief

Robert Bollinger founded the company 11 years ago in New York with a plan to produce a body-on-frame electric truck and SUV clearly inspired by and modeled in the style of the original Land Rover Defender off-roader. A few years in, the company realized it should move to Detroit, Michigan, and it eventually dropped plans for its smaller SUV and truck in favor of larger commercial vehicles it dubbed the B4 and longer-wheelbase B5. Bollinger then left the company as CEO 11 months ago after he sold it to new owner Mullen Automotive Inc., which has since reported a $115 million net loss on revenue of $2.9 million in Q4 of last year.

Then The Trouble Started

Bollinger sued Mullen over an unpaid $10 million loan agreement in March, and when the company failed to send a representative to a meeting in May, the judge sided with the former CEO. ""A receiver is in charge of the company,"" Robert Bollinger told Automotive News. ""The main goal is to sell the company as a going concern. Most of the assets are in my possession,"" he said. Mullen must propose a deadline for a liquidation plan within 30 days now. All of Bollinger Motors' assets have been frozen, and Mullen no longer manages day-to-day operations for the company.

""Mullen did an amazing job of funding us and getting us to where we are,"" Bollinger said. ""There’s a lot of interest in the product, and the best possible outcome is for the company to continue as it is.""

There Are Not Many Bollinger EVs Out There Yet

So far, Bollinger Motors has reportedly only built 40 Class 4 so-called B4 commercial vehicles, a majority of which have reportedly not been sold and are sitting at the company's headquarters in Michigan. They retail for around $135,000 with an all-electric range of around 185 miles. So far, $148 million has been invested in the startup, about $3 million of which was granted from the state of Michigan. The automaker currently has 100 employees, and the former CEO reportedly has personally guaranteed their incomes will be sustained in the near term while the company gets sorted.

The ruling was issued late Friday and brings a halt to the county’s efforts to hold a number of major companies financially responsible for climate change-related damages in the county.

In the lawsuit, the county sought damages to cover costs associated with climate change, including repairs to infrastructure damaged by increasingly severe storms and flooding. The county has seen a number of serious flooding incidents in recent years, including the deaths of seven people in Upper Makefield Township.

At an hours-long hearing in March, attorneys for the fossil fuel companies argued that the county lacked standing to bring such claims in county court.

“Is it bigger than this little old judge in Bucks County?” Corr joked during the hearing.

In his decision, Corr sided with the fossil fuel companies’ arguments for dismissal.

The judge stated that “Pennsylvania cannot apply its own laws to claims dealing with air in its ambient or interstate aspects.” He concluded that the court lacked the necessary jurisdiction to hear the case.

The judge’s ruling aligns with the companies’ argument that there have been juridical challenges in similar cases across the country.

Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., counsel for Chevron Corporation, issued a statement Saturday morning after reviewing the decision.

“As Judge Corr declared, his decision joins the ‘growing chorus of state and federal courts across the United States, singing from the same hymnal,’ concluding the ‘our federal structure does not allow Pennsylvania law, or any State’s law, to address’ climate change lawsuits. The court also got it right when it expressed ‘concern about the manner in which the Commissioners went about hiring counsel and filing this lawsuit,’ and found that ‘the conduct of the Commissioners violated the spirit of’ Pennsylvania’s open government act,” Boutrous said.

Beyond the jurisdictional issue, Corr also expressed “concern about the manner in which the commissioners went about hiring counsel and filing this lawsuit,” finding that their conduct “violated the spirit of Pennsylvania’s open government act,” known as the Sunshine Act.

In his written decision, Corr called the hiring of the law firm a “cryptic summary” of the agenda and noted the lack of public discussion or commissioner comment on it prior to the filing.

The judge stated that the lawsuit’s focus was primarily on “emissions,” a matter he deemed to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government through the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He noted the frequent use of the word “emissions” in the complaint compared to the terms “deceptive” or “deception.”

Corr’s decision noted that the claims raised by Bucks County were “so intertwined with emissions” that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. He emphasized that “our federal structure does not allow Pennsylvania’s law, or any state’s law, to address the claims raised in Bucks County’s complaint.”

A county spokesperson declined comment Saturday morning on the decision.

Dan Flynn, an attorney for the county, said during the March hearing that the case was similar to those against big tobacco.

“It’s not about solving climate change,” Flynn said. “It’s about Bucks County surviving it.”

The Bucks County Commissioners voted in January 2024 to hire the DiCello Levitt law firm on a contingency basis to pursue potential environmental claims. The vote, part of a consent agenda, was approved by all three commissioners, two Democrats and one Republican.

Republican Commissioner Gene DiGirolamo initially supported the lawsuit.

DiGirolamo spoke in support at the 2024 press conference announcing the lawsuit. However, he later stated he “would like to withdraw my support for the lawsuit.”

The EPA said it’s part of $267 million awarded nationwide to transform polluted sites into housing and business developments to promote economic growth. The move comes as the agency has halted funds for environmental justice and climate work and reorganizes as part of cost-cutting measures by the Trump administration.

“EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.”

The Trump administration has sought to rein in more than two dozen environmental regulations in favor of oil and gas projects, saying it lowers costs for Americans and businesses.

EPA Regional Administrator Anne Vogel said the grants will protect public health and the environment “while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.”

The money will go to nine local, state and tribal entities. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Milwaukee Redevelopment Authority and city of West Allis will receive between $650,000 and $3 million in supplemental money for revolving loan funds to finance redevelopment projects.

In Milwaukee, the city’s redevelopment authority will use $650,000 to fund cleanups at the Compass Lofts, the Tempo Hotel and the Historic Patterson Place. The agency will also receive $500,000 for cleaning up a site that’s being leased by the nonprofit Jewish Community Center for a food pantry. The money will be used to clean up the site and a 50,000-square-foot warehouse that’s contaminated with volatile organic compounds.

Six other communities and the Oneida Nation will receive anywhere from $500,000 to $2 million to conduct environmental assessments or cleanups. They include the cities of Kenosha, Racine and Brillion.

The move comes as Zeldin has said the EPA canceled $1.7 billion in grants as part of efforts by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency to slash funding, programs and the federal workforce.

Trump has also proposed cutting the agency’s 2026 budget by more than half and cutting staff to levels not seen since the Reagan administration. Environmental advocates have said that will affect the agency’s ability to address contaminated sites.

Early on, the versatile internal combustion engine overtook the venerable horse and buggy. Later, the automatic transmission revolutionized motoring by largely replacing the manual gearbox, and all the steps it took to drive. As time progressed, safety features like padded dashboards, crumple zones, three-point seatbelts, and airbags made cars exponentially safer than they were in prior decades. And today, we’re living in another period of great technological transformation as automakers strive to make their vehicles more efficient than they’ve ever been before.

Slowly but surely, vehicle manufacturers are moving away from fossil fuel-burning engines to electric drivetrains. Progress has been irregular, coming in fits and spurts, varying greatly from country to country. But like it or not, personal transportation is going electric, which provides numerous benefits, like greatly reduced maintenance, much improved vehicle refinement, and, of course, vastly better efficiency, though EVs are still not perfect. Batteries are the weak link. They’re staggeringly expensive, can weigh thousands of pounds, and the range even the best packs can provide leaves much to be desired. Addressing these downsides, companies like Toyota are working to develop next-generation solid-state batteries that could revolutionize transportation, just like internal combustion did more than 100 years ago.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including Car and Driver, The Harvard Gazette, Renogy, and Oil & Energy Online.

Toyota’s SSB Breakthrough Redefines What EVs Can Do

The benefits of solid-state batteries are numerous and impactful. These power-storage systems promise far greater energy density, which translates into significantly lower weight and dramatically increased vehicle range, the very definition of a win-win. Solid-state batteries can also charge much more quickly, should last far longer, and they even provide greatly enhanced margins of safety as they’re much less likely to catch on fire than existing lithium-ion designs. Solid electrolytes should not be flammable, but liquid or gel ones can ignite.

Promises Up To 745 Miles On A Single Charge – More Than Doubling Most EVs Today

Those are just a few of the reasons why automakers including Honda, the Hyundai Motor Group, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and, yes, even Toyota, are developing solid-state batteries, but that’s not all. Supplier companies including CATL, LG Energy, Panasonic, Samsung, and many others are all working on this technology, as are researchers at numerous academic institutions.

Highlighting just how massive a leap forward solid-state energy storage technology will be, Toyota said that by the end of this decade it should have developed a battery that will provide a whopping 745 miles of range on a single charge. That’s a staggering amount, more than twice as much as some very good electric vehicles offer today, a huge upgrade, but that’s not the limit, oh no.

The Japanese automaker estimates the second-generation of its solid-state battery design could provide around 932 miles of range. Assuming this sort of energy reservoir doesn’t weigh 47,000 pounds and cost more than a mansion in Malibu, the technology could absolutely revolutionize transportation. Imagine an all-electric Camry or RAV4 that was affordably priced and could travel nearly 1,000 miles on a single charge. The world would be completely changed if Toyota pulled off something like that.

Achieves This With A More Compact, Lightweight Battery Design

Thanks to greater energy density than even the best lithium-ion batteries available today can provide, solid-state packs are significantly lighter and more compact. These improvements will help engineers further enhance vehicle performance and efficiency, as mass is the enemy of acceleration, handling, and braking.

Bulky battery packs eat into passenger and cargo space, but solid-state designs can improve vehicle packaging, too. An example of the efficiencies that can be gained by switching to a solid-state design, Toyota mentioned in a press release that the battery in the bZ4X utility vehicle is around 6 inches tall (150 mm), but in the future, that measurement could be reduced to around 4.7 inches (120 mm), and maybe even 4 inches (100 mm) in a sportier model where a low roof height is desired. That is a significant size reduction, especially if the range offered remains significantly improved. Having a smaller battery pack means there can be more room for passengers and cargo.

Solid-State Chemistry Unlocks Major Advantages

As mentioned above, solid-state batteries provide greater energy density, are safer, last longer, and can charge much faster than lithium-ion packs with liquid or gel electrolytes. As Toyota succinctly summed up in a media release, “Solid-state battery technology is a potential cure-all for the drawbacks facing electric vehicles that run on conventional lithium-ion batteries, including the relatively short distance traveled on a single charge as well as charging times.”

Uses A Solid Electrolyte Instead Of Liquid, Improving Safety And Stability

As the name suggests, solid-state batteries have an electrolyte that is, you guessed it, solid. Opposed to liquid electrolytes, this allows ions to move faster inside the individual battery cells, plus this configuration is much more tolerant of high temperatures and voltages. These important attributes improve longevity and safety, plus they’re key to increasing energy density.

The benefits of this technology are so great, that Toyota is putting enormous resources into commercializing solid-state batteries. In fact, the automaker has been researching this technology since way back in 2012, and as of a couple of years ago, Toyota has been awarded more than 1,000 patents in this field. Undoubtedly, that figure is even greater today, as engineers have continued to work on perfecting this tantalizing but challenging technology.

Enables Faster Charging, Higher Energy Density, And Longer Lifespan

Since solid electrolytes aren’t nearly as flammable, the risk of battery fires is greatly reduced. If a car’s pack ever ignites, it’s an absolute nightmare for firefighters to contend with, requiring thousands upon thousands of gallons of water to extinguish, and even then, there’s a risk that damaged packs could reignite before disposal, for instance.

And if that weren’t bad enough, lithium-ion battery fires also release torrents of acrid – and poisonous – fumes, plus certain lithium-ion chemistries produce oxygen when heated by flames, which just accelerates how quickly these packs burn. The fire hazard is so great, in fact, one safety expert even thinks it’s best to just allow lithium-ion batteries to burn themselves out rather than trying to extinguish the flames.

Aside from concerns around fires, solid-state batteries should last far longer than their conventional counterparts while charging much quicker, too. Reportedly, today’s standard lithium-ion batteries can usually be charged 1,500 to 2,000 times before their usefulness is depleted. Solid-state batteries, however, can survive many times more charging cycles than that, perhaps up to 10,000, a huge difference that highlights the fundamental ruggedness of this design.

Charging Times Could Shrink Dramatically

Since ions can move around much faster within solid-state batteries than in comparable cells made with liquid electrolyte, these packs can charge dramatically quicker. In fact, the speed difference between conventional lithium-ion batteries and solid-state packs is absolutely staggering. This technological breakthrough pretty much eliminates the time difference between recharging a battery and pumping gas into a vehicle’s tank, solid-state is that big a deal.

Toyota Claims Potential 10-Minute Fast Charging With SSB Tech

Just how quickly can one of these fancy new batteries charge? Assuming you can find a DC fast charger that puts out enough juice, Toyota expects its design to go from a 10-percent state of charge to 80 percent in 10 minutes or less. Other estimates put the 0-to-100-percent time at as little as 15 minutes. For context, the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5, one of the fastest-charging EVs available today, can go from a 10-to-80-percent state of charge in around 20 minutes when hooked to an appropriate power source. That means Toyota’s new solid-state battery charges roughly twice as fast, an incredible performance.

Reduces One Of The Biggest Friction Points In EV Ownership

That commendable charging speed makes the ownership experience so much better by addressing perhaps the biggest pain point with electric vehicles. Today, DC fast charging can be anything but. Charging speeds are often significantly reduced if there are other vehicles juicing up at the same time, It’s often difficult to find an available – and more importantly, functional – charger, and it can sometimes be a challenge to find a charger that puts out enough power for your EV. The Ioniq 5 mentioned earlier should top out somewhere around 257 kW. Plugging into a 150-kW charger is not going to provide the best experience, even though that may be all that’s available at certain times.

Of course, solid-state batteries can’t magically address all these issues, but the technology is still a huge upgrade over existing energy-storage systems. And the experience will only get better as public infrastructure expands and improves.

Sets The Bar For The Next Generation Of Electric Vehicles

Today’s crop of electric vehicles is something of a mixed bag. Offerings from the Hyundai Motor Group are phenomenal, as are certain aspects of Teslas. GM and Ford both have some solid, if not quite segment-leading EVs, and then there’s Toyota, which is, unfortunately, behind the curve in electrics. The company’s bZ4X and Lexus RZ utility vehicles are neither compelling nor particularly competitive, but future models could leapfrog the competition if Toyota can commercialize affordable and reliable solid-state batteries.

Could Outperform Traditional Lithium-Ion Batteries In Almost Every Metric

This exciting new energy-storage technology is superior to the lithium-ion batteries available today in nearly every way. Solid-state batteries should last longer, charge faster, provide superior energy density for greater range and lower weight, and they should be significantly safer, too.

Of course, there are a few issues holding back solid-state batteries, problems that Toyota and other researchers are racing address. These batteries tend to be expensive, longevity has been a serious weak point with prototype designs, and there are myriad manufacturing challenges to tackle. The good news is, these problems are being sorted out. In fact, Toyota is aiming to commence limited production of solid-state batteries late this year. Commercial manufacturing could come online by 2027 or 2028, which, in automotive terms, is literally right around the corner, since it usually takes between three and five years to introduce a new vehicle.

Signals A Leap Forward Not Just For Toyota, But The Entire EV Industry

They’re not quite ready to hit the road in meaningful numbers, but solid-state batteries are poised to arrive in short order. It remains to be seen which automaker, supplier company or potentially even academic institution will be the first to commercialize this revolutionary technology, but given the progress it’s made and the statements it’s shared, Toyota could very well be first.

If the Japanese firm crosses the finish line before its competition, Toyota will have a huge advantage in the electric vehicle space, though probably not for long. Other companies will eventually unlock the secrets of solid-state batteries and level the playing field once more, which is not necessarily good news for Toyota, but it’s great for drivers around the world that are looking for more efficient vehicles.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/how-toyota-s-745-mile-ssb-could-set-the-standard-for-the-next-decade.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 23:00:12.604078

The rule required states to impose best available retrofit technology (BART) on certain pollution sources, usually electric generation plants.
However, the rule also allowed states to instead adopt alternative approaches provided they met the EPA’s better-than-BART standard.
The EPA concluded that the requirements of its Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), an emissions-control program, were stringent enough to make compliance with CSAPR a better-than-BART alternative.

The EPA concluded that the requirements of its Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), an emissions-control program, were stringent enough to make compliance with CSAPR a better-than-BART alternative. Consequently, states participating in CSAPR were excused from complying with BART itself. The National Parks Conservation Association and others (conservationists) (plaintiffs) challenged that EPA determination. They argued that because CSAPR was promulgated under a different section of the Clean Air Act, it would take effect regardless of BART. Consequently, the EPA needed to consider the reduction in emissions that would be achieved by CSAPR and BART combined versus the reduction that would be achieved by CSAPR alone to determine whether CSAPR constituted a better-than-BART alternative. In conjunction with adopting the rule amendment, the EPA also disapproved certain state implementation plans (SIPs) that relied on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), a predecessor to CSAPR that had been overturned. The EPA issued federal implementation plans that would apply in the disapproved states until the states came up with new plans that incorporated CSAPR. Utility Air Regulatory Group, certain states, and others (industry and state parties) challenged the EPA’s disapproval of the SIPs, arguing that even though CAIR itself was no longer effective, if meeting CAIR’s requirements constituted a better-than-BART alternative in prior years, then it must still be considered a better-than-BART alternative.

Petition questions substation sites on sole source aquifer The petitioners are specifically questioning the substations in Avangrid's New England Wind 1 and New England Wind 2 projects, formerly Park City Wind and Commonwealth Wind.
""We ask for the same consideration for the same reason,"" the petition states, namely, potential contamination of the same sole source aquifer.","A Barnstable group petitioned the EPA to review Avangrid's offshore wind projects due to drinking water concerns.

The petition cites potential threats to the Cape Cod sole source aquifer from substations and underground cables.

The group argues the EPA has legal grounds to intervene under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other regulations.

Save Greater Dowses Beach, a Barnstable-based group with members across Cape Cod and New England, is appealing to the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene in what it sees as a serious threat to the region’s drinking water from offshore wind development.

The organization recently submitted a petition from 37 Barnstable residents. They are asking the agency to conduct an impartial review of Avangrid Renewables’ offshore wind projects, which would bring electrical cables ashore and connect them to large substations in Barnstable.

""Our objections to these cable landings are many, but the danger posed to human health and safety is at the top of our list. That naturally includes protecting the sole source of drinking water for the people of Barnstable and Cape Cod,"" said Susanne Conley, SGDB chairwoman and co-founder.

Avangrid declined to comment on the petition.

Petition questions substation sites on sole source aquifer

The petitioners are specifically questioning the substations in Avangrid's New England Wind 1 and New England Wind 2 projects, formerly Park City Wind and Commonwealth Wind. They say the proposed sites sit on land vital to recharging the Cape Cod Sole Source Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to 250,000 year-round residents — and many more in summer — and are near areas set aside to protect future water sources.

They also express concern about the already completed substation in the industrial park off Industrial Drive in Hyannis, which supports the Vineyard Wind project.

""We’re asking EPA to consider the cumulative environmental hazard of three extra high voltage substations built over the aquifer,"" Conley said, adding the group believes the Vineyard Wind substation ""should never have been built in such close proximity to an apartment complex.""

A plea for 'legally required' federal review

The group argues that the EPA is legally required to review the plans under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, which calls for federal oversight of any project using federal funds that could affect a sole source aquifer.

Even though the wind projects aren't directly funded by the government, the group asserts that they depend on significant federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act to cover about a third of their costs, which top $5 billion. The petition argues that an earlier EPA decision not to intervene was based on an overly limited view of what counts as federal funding and asks the agency to take another look under the current leadership.

The petition also highlights the agency's responsibilities under the Clean Air Act of 1970, as well as its own Sole Source Aquifer program.

“The EPA cannot simply ignore its responsibility under the Sole Source Aquifer Program,” the petition states, pointing out that ""the health and well-being of the residents of Barnstable and the surrounding region of Cape Cod are at stake.""

The petitioners cite ""significant hazard to public health,"" asserting the projects ""all require individual substations that utilize toxic dielectric fluid and potential use of sulfur hexafluoride, of SF6, a toxic greenhouse gas that lingers in the environment.

The developer has said that state-of-the-art containment systems — described publicly as a “bathtub” — would prevent any leaks from getting into the soil or water table. But the petition cites expert testimony warning that fires, explosions, and even truck accidents during transport to and from the substations could cause serious spills that could permanently contaminate the aquifer.

Concerns about heat, toxins, and water quality

The group also worries about the heat that underground high-voltage cables would generate. Engineers say the cables can radiate temperatures up to 180°F, and although they’ll be buried in concrete, they’ll lie at the same depth as Barnstable’s drinking water pipes.

""This has caused serious concerns for the COMM Water Commission, which is currently incommunication with the proponent to determine the extent of thermal effect on the drinkingwater of three of the town’s seven villages,"" such as bacterial growth, according to the petition.

The water commission and the developer are currently negotiating the terms for an independent study to determine how the duct banks may affect water quality, according to the petition.

""This level of uncertainty should be of concern"" to the EPA, the petition states, especially ""given the proponent’s stated desire to begin duct bank construction in the fall of 2025.""

The group further asserts that the overall permitting process for the projects has not treated the town fairly. The state Energy Facilities Siting Board denied the town’s request for “intervenor” status, which would have allowed the town to participate formally in decisions about where the substations would be built.

EPA asked to reconsider scope and precedent

Finally, the petition questions why the EPA did not extend its onshore permitting beyond air quality concerns for offshore operations.

SGDB argues that the EPA stepped in before because of concerns about aquifer contamination — like when a controversial firing range was proposed at Joint Base Cape Cod — and should do so again.

""We ask for the same consideration for the same reason,"" the petition states, namely, potential contamination of the same sole source aquifer.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for Wisconsin families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, they are trying to undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Wisconsin has become a solar and grid-scale battery manufacturing hub, with clean energy investments creating tens of thousands of jobs across the state. This Republican bill guts battery manufacturing by imposing impossible red tape and short-changing new and existing battery manufacturers. This bill also effectively repeals tax credits for commercial and utility-scale solar, imposing retroactive tax increases and pulling the rug out from under projects by shortening timelines, adding impossible red tape, and repealing key financing tools. Make no mistake, this bill takes a sledgehammer to Wisconsin’s economy.

The Republican Repeal Bill Will Raise Energy Costs in Wisconsin

• If federal clean energy tax credits are repealed by Trump and congressional Republicans, Wisconsin households are expected to see an average increase in energy costs of 5.6% in 2026.

• If clean energy tax credits and key pollution regulations are repealed, Wisconsin households are expected to see an increase in total annual energy costs of $153 in 2030.

• Solar, wind, and battery storage accounted for 93% of all new American energy supply in 2024. Undermining these key energy supplies as demand is skyrocketing would lead to higher energy costs for American families and businesses.

The Republican Repeal Bill Will Kill Jobs and Decimate Manufacturing in Wisconsin

If federal clean energy tax credits are repealed by Trump and congressional Republicans, Wisconsin is expected to lose 5,200 jobs by 2030 and 6,400 jobs by 2035.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would decrease Wisconsin’s GDP by $1 billion in 2030 and $1.1 billion in 2035.

Of the roughly 400,000 new clean energy jobs announced across the country since August 2022, more than half (53%) are located in congressional districts represented by Republicans. Under Congressional Republicans’ plans, all of these jobs are at risk.

Twelve of Wisconsin’s fifteen new clean energy projects are in Republican-held districts, representing 80% of all projects in the state, 96.3% of jobs (2,632), and 45.8% of investments ($2.49 billion).

While some Republicans will attempt to claim that they are simply placing reasonable limitations on these clean energy tax credits, the reality is that they are deliberately making them completely unworkable, with even Senate Republicans such as Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia and Kevin Cramer from North Dakota saying the bill is unreasonable. As SEIA, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.”

The moment is now upon us — and the outlook for the IRA after the release of House Republicans’ mega budget bill ranges from bleak to dead, depending on who you ask.

This is just a first draft, and the provisions — including the rollback of key tax credits — are subject to change, likely depending on how effectively members such as Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) push for them (and what happens in the Senate).

Let’s get into it.

The News of the Week: IRA rollback

When Ways & Means Republicans released their portion of the “big, beautiful bill” Monday, clean energy advocates were dismayed. After a lengthy lobbying blitz, Republicans’ approach veered more toward a gutting of the bill — phasing out key credits and hampering the ones that have been preserved — rather than a more fine-tuned one.

Here’s what the bill would do:

Cut two key demand-side credits — 30D, which provides a consumer tax credit for American-sourced electric vehicle purchases, and 25D, a subsidy for rooftop solar — by the end of the year.

Phase down investment and production tax credits starting in 2029, with a full phasedown by 2031. Clean energy advocates were happy to see their tech-neutrality maintained — there were fears that solar, in particular, could be cut out.

Begin to phase down the 45X manufacturing tax credit — a source of financing for critical minerals operations and battery and solar manufacturing — in 2031.

End transferability for tax credits after 2027, a key tool for project financing flexibility that allows companies — many of which do not yet pay taxes or have limited liability because they’re not yet generating income — to sell their tax credits and carry them forward.

Change the eligibility rules for tax credits so that projects must be “placed in service” rather than having begun construction to claim them.

Create a complex web of “foreign entity of concern” provisions, many of which would need to be litigated in rulemaking, that limit companies’ ability to source parts or work with companies that have ownership interests from countries (namely China) that the U.S. has deemed to be national security risks.

The IRA helped create a veritable boom across the country — and in Northern Nevada in particular — in clean energy investment and helped build out U.S. supply chains for renewable parts, many of which had never been manufactured or processed in the U.S. before.

Read more about the IRA’s impact in Nevada, and how an IRA rollback would affect the lithium loop and the solar industry.

In Nevada specifically, the Clean Investment Monitor estimates that companies have announced about $28.3 billion in low-carbon energy investments in the state since the IRA’s passage — which brings jobs and workforce development programs. Of that, $15.4 billion is still unspent. Announced projects that have yet to break ground are the ones that could be most imperiled by the rollback, between the limits on financing and the foreign entity of concern rules, given that some parts and technology do not yet exist outside of China.

“Members of Congress should not be surprised if this bill passes as drafted, and over the next several years, a lot of projects that have been announced that people are excited about are significantly scaled down or do not move forward at all,” said Albert Gore III, the president of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which has lobbied on behalf of tax credits that benefit the electric vehicle and battery supply chain, including for companies in Nevada.

Gore was particularly dismayed by the early phasedown of the manufacturing 45X tax credit and the complete cut of the 30D consumer tax credit. He said that those credits worked in tandem to incentivize automakers to onshore their operations, including sourcing lithium in the U.S.

Nevada, which has the only operating lithium mine in the U.S., has big plans for the critical mineral that exists abundantly in the state and powers EV batteries. Projects such as Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge have received massive federal loans to build mining projects in the state, and have already signed offtake agreements with large automakers.

But industry advocates warn that battery makers and automakers were pursuing American lithium — including Nevada’s — because of the tax credits, which allowed them to source American lithium at a price point that was competitive with foreign-mined and processed lithium.

“I have a hard time thinking that the economic opportunity, the business forecast, the investment forecasts for the lithium loop that that have existed the past couple years in Nevada can endure and continue in the present state, given the demand destruction,” said Harry Godfrey, a managing director at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United.

And even though the most important tax credit to Nevada — the manufacturing 45X credit — was maintained through 2031, Gore cautioned that the early phasedown, the incredibly tight foreign entity of concern provisions and the requirement that projects be in service will hamper future growth, including with announced projects. Mining, refining and manufacturing projects can take a decade, if not longer, to move through permitting and construction phases. Companies may now find the credit — and some of the market demand — gone by the time they’re ready to produce.

And in a macro sense, advocates — and members of Congress — are worried about the bill leading to energy costs rising. The IRA tax credits were intended to allow companies to move more quickly to generate new clean energy to add to the grid and help meet increasing demand. Without that, states may have to rely more on natural gas.

According to a study by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, repealing two key credits (which the Republican bill targeted for early phasedown) could lead to electricity prices being 7.3 percent higher for Nevada households from 2026 to 2032.

Some industry advocates expressed optimism that the proposal would be tweaked. Senate Republicans — several of whom want to maintain subsidies for less mature technologies — have already balked at some of the provisions.

The Nevada Angle

In March, Amodei told me that preservation of 45X (manufacturing) and 30D (consumer EV credits) were red lines for him. On Tuesday, he was less stringent on 30D, saying that the EV industry will continue to grow regardless and that the demand for Nevada lithium is not reliant on the credit.

“We're pushing all the lithium stuff, pushing all the recycling stuff,” Amodei said. “I think there's definitely demand there. I don't think they need that credit to keep their place.”

Industry insiders agreed that the demand for lithium will persist, but that Nevada-made lithium may not be able to compete without the consumer tax credit.

But he and 12 other Republicans passionate about the preservation of key credits have already made a list of demands for leadership — changes to the foreign entity of concern provisions, restoring transferability and going back to the construction standard instead of the new “in service” requirement.

However, none threatened to withhold their vote.

Amodei said he met with advocates this week to formulate a lobbying plan for their most important asks.

“Now we got some time to put together a lobbying plan,” he said. “How do we fine tune this to make it even more [helpful] for the Teslas and Redwood [Materials]?”

The Impact

Growing the renewable energy industry in Nevada has been a bipartisan endeavor at the federal and state levels, with the geographic blessings of lithium and sunshine an appealing pathway to diversify the state’s economy beyond gaming.

This is just the first draft, and much of the negotiating will occur behind the scenes. But I’ll be monitoring how key stakeholders engage with the bill, especially when the Senate gets its say.

Around the Capitol

💦Colorado River concerns — Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) is raising a new concern over the Utah public land sales included in the reconciliation bill. Lee and Rep. Greg Stanton (D-AZ) say the parcels align with a planned route for the Lake Powell pipeline, which brings water from the Colorado River to Utah and could potentially upset negotiations over the river’s water usage.

Lee again called on Amodei to withdraw those portions of the bill.

🏭Apex authorization — Rep. Steven Horsford’s (D-NV) bill — which makes technical corrections to the Apex Site land by allowing Clark County to develop projects that produce hazardous byproducts on the federal land without specific approvals — passed the House by a voice vote.

Over the years, India’s EV policies have been focused on increasing domestic manufacturing and incentivising the setup of adequate charging infrastructure, along with facilitating import of critical minerals on concessional duties. From the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME I) scheme launched in 2015, with a budget outlay of Rs 895 Crore, to FAME-II launched in 2019 with an outlay of Rs 11,500 crore and now, the currently applicable, PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) Scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,900 Crore - India has predominantly sought to accelerate EV adoption through domestic manufacturing.

Additionally, to strengthen the EV ecosystem and reduce import reliance, the Government in May 2021 launched a Rs 18,100 Crore PLI scheme for advance cell chemistry manufacturing and later in January 2025 launched the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) with an outlay of Rs 16,300 crore. Also, the Union Budget over the last two years has exempted customs duty on critical minerals and capital goods required for EV battery manufacturing.

In March 2024, given the push from global auto manufacturers, particularly Tesla, to provide access to India market, and to attract investments from global EV manufacturers - India introduced the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI). SPMEPCI contemplates that approved applicants would be able to import completely built units of e-4W at a reduced customs duty of 15 per cent provided they meet the conditions set out in the scheme. The conditions set out in SPMEPCI include the requirement to invest a minimum of Rs 4,150 crore in setting up manufacturing facilities in India to manufacture e-4W, and that such facility must be operational within 3 years to achieve a minimum Domestic Value Addition (DVA) of at least 25 per cent by the end of the third year, and 50 per cent by the end of the fifth year. It may be relevant to note that the current customs duty (outside the SPMEPCI) on passenger vehicles (4W) which are of a value lower than USD 40,000 is about 70 per cent and those of a value higher than USD 40,000 is about 110 per cent. Therefore, SPMEPCI offers significant duty concessions albeit subject to certain conditions.

While Tesla appears to have decided to make its much-awaited India entry pursuant to the SPMEPCI, the scheme has received a mild reaction from other global players like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. India is a price sensitive market and for global players whose portfolio comprises of only high-end models, going under SPMEPCI may not seem attractive. They would be required to commit to a significant investment without having a commensurate market share.

Accordingly, the outcome of the ongoing trade negotiations is eagerly awaited by auto manufacturers across the globe. For context - prior to the recently concluded India- UK free trade agreement (FTA), India had 13 FTAs with predominantly South Asian countries, notable exceptions being UAE and Australia, and 6 preferential trade agreements. India is now looking to conclude agreements with US and EU, amongst other major economies.

Further, while the text of the India-UK FTA is yet to be finalised and published, from publicly available information, it appears that the UK auto manufacturers are looking to significantly benefit from lower import duties agreed by India (reduced from over 100 per cent to 10 per cent in a staggered manner) for a certain number of cars. Similarly, India will be allowed to export a quota of EVs and hybrid cars to the UK at concessional tariff, but in stages and within the prescribed quota. It may be relevant to note that once the text of the India-UK FTA is finalised and signed, both countries will need to ratify it before it can come into force and this is expected to take up to a year.

The conclusion of the India-UK FTA negotiations marks a significant milestone in India’s evolving stance on global trade and has set the tone for other trade negotiations. It appears that for other FTAs, the Government of India may consider similar reductions in tariffs (and potential modifications to the SPMEPCI), or even the introduction of zero-duty imports under certain conditions. Additionally, it has also sent a strong signal that while India may be open to tariff reductions, this would happen only in a phased manner giving domestic manufacturers time to scale up.

FTAs are likely to have a significant impact on the direction, pace and competition in India’s EV sector. On one hand, reducing tariffs may provide Indian customers with an array of options to transition out of ICE engines and move to EVs, and on the other hand, it may threaten the domestic EV ecosystem which is still in the nascent phase and where manufacturers have made significant long-term investments based on India’s energy transition goals. Having said so, Indian automakers, such as Tata Motors and Mahindra, are also closely watching the opportunities and the incentives that the FTAs, such as the one between India and UK, provide to export Indian EVs outside India and to create synergies with their global counterparts.

At this point, the Indian government is aiming to strike a careful balance between safeguarding the domestic EV ecosystem, attracting global investment, and securing favourable tariff access for Indian exports and it remains to be seen if all of these objectives can be met across all ongoing FTA negotiations, and if so, to what extent.",https://static.businessworld.in/Image India -UK FTA_20250517173009_ogImage_42.png,N,,2025-05-17 23:00:31.518544

Citing a change in “administration priorities,” the Environmental Protection Agency notified Gonzaga University on May 2 of the impending cancellation of a $19.9 million grant devoted to climate resiliency in Spokane’s disadvantaged, low-income communities, according to a joint news release from the city of Spokane and the private Jesuit school decrying the move.

The Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment was awarded the Community Change Grant last July as one of 21 climate change-related projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It was the university’s single largest grant award in Gonzaga’s nearly 140-year history, and school and city officials say it would have contributed greatly to the region’s adjustment to the ongoing climate crisis.

Hundreds of low-income homes were to be retrofitted with heat pumps and high-quality air filtration systems, five community centers and libraries were going to be bolstered to serve as extreme weather shelters, and several prospective workers were to be trained for jobs in clean energy – all as a result of the funding.

“It always feels hyperbolic to say people’s lives are at stake,” said institute director Brian G. Henning. “But it’s literally true right now.”

Fearing significant consequences to Spokane residents if the EPA follows through, leaders for the city and Gonzaga University are now calling on the agency to change course. They argue the Trump administration’s move lacks legal standing and jeopardizes the public health and safety of the region.

“We are concerned not only about the process by which this decision was made, but even more so about its very real consequences for the people we serve,” Gonzaga President Thayne McCulloh said in a statement. “Our mission is to educate and serve. This grant enables our community to learn how to deal with dangerous climate conditions and help the thousands of community members who lack the ability to protect themselves from the extreme heat and wildfire smoke that is all too common in the Inland Northwest today.”

The plea from the private-public coalition includes a call for federal legislators “to intervene for their constituents by urging immediate reinstatement of the grant,” in addition to stressing its importance and requesting a formal explanation on the legal grounds of the decision – a request Congressman Michael Baumgartner indicated he would not be considering.

“I’ve not been briefed on the project and don’t know much about it, but with $36 trillion in federal debt and a federal 20% budget deficit, some tough decisions need to be made about sending some spending decisions back to the local government level,” Baumgartner said. “It could be that it’s a very good program, but just not one that a broke federal government can afford.”

While Baumgartner appeared to agree with the grant’s termination, Senator Patty Murray came to its defense in a heated budget discussion with Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zelding at a Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee hearing Wednesday. In an exchange specifically about the cancellation of the grant to the Gonzaga Climate Institute, Murray pried for details and told Zelding he was “abandoning communities.”

“There was no explanation for that cancellation,” Murray said. “That is a community that saw 19 people die and over 300 people hospitalized during a heat wave a few short years ago, where wildfires are a constant threat. So let me ask you, is it woke to protect people from wildfires and heat stroke?”

“I don’t know if you’re going to get anyone in America to answer yes to the way you put that question out there,” Zeldin responded.

Zeldin did not offer a specific reason for the cancellation, as Murray continued to probe, only stating that “there are hundreds of grants,” and he would need the Spokane award in front of him to discuss details.

Spokane Mayor Lisa Brown said in a statement Friday the work to which the funding was devoted was already underway when the EPA sent their notice. She argued the goals and scope of the program, while receiving bipartisan support, are “not about politics,” but about people and “protecting neighbors and investing in a healthier, safer future for Spokane.”

“The decision to terminate this grant puts lives at risk and undermines locally led solutions to climate and public health challenges,” Brown said. “Make no mistake, recent history shows just how critical this funding is to ensure the health, safety, and economic stability of so many Spokane families.”

More than 150 people statewide, including 20 Spokane County residents, died from heat-related causes during the record-breaking multiday heat wave that blanketed the Pacific Northwest in July 2021. The majority of local heat-wave deaths were elderly people who died in their homes, according to Spokane County Medical Examiner Dr. Veena Singh.

It was the deadliest weather event in state history and drives home exactly why the work covered by the grant was needed, Henning said. In the past 30 years, heat has killed more people nationally on average than tornadoes, floods or hurricanes, according to the National Weather Service.

“It’s only a matter of time before it happens again,” Henning said. “So we’ve been racing against the clock to try and do whatever we can to improve the resilience to the next such event, and these resources were going to make a big difference in helping to do that.”

Nearly 95% of the grant funding was devoted to tangible services and infrastructure improvements, like the establishment of extreme weather shelters and upgrades to qualifying houses, the release states. The Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment was the lead recipient and pass-thru administrator for the funds, but the work was to be spread among several nonprofits and civic bodies, including Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners, the city of Spokane, Spokane Public Library and the Carl Maxey Center.

“It’s really a huge investment that will save lives and make a difference for those people who are most vulnerable,” Henning said. “As you can imagine, spending millions of dollars on infrastructure improvements has a lot of impact on jobs and the economy in an immediate way.”

Around $2.6 million was going to be set aside into the “Community Climate Action Fund,” which is intended to be a resource for community organizations seeking funding to do climate-resilience work. The Gonzaga Climate Institute is encouraging groups to still apply by its May 31 deadline regardless of the uncertainty surrounding the fund’s future, citing a need for ideas and action to address the climate crisis.

The school is “actively recruiting additional funders who might be willing to invest in work proposed through the Climate Fund,” according to a statement on the application portal.

“I understand why people would consider whether or not they want to apply for these funds, but I am strongly of the view that having good ideas that are well formulated, that are shovel ready, is worth everybody’s time,” Henning said. “Because we need these good ideas, and then we can find ways of funding it. We urgently need to do that, so we’ll find other means, over time, if necessary.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/etipN8F_aylNkVfhh0S_E3gz0nA=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/05/16/62daf7e230caf.hires.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 12:11:36.477517

He may have to buck Donald Trump to protect it.

Since Rep. Juan Ciscomani took office in 2023, electric car manufacturer Lucid Motors quadrupled the size of its plant in Casa Grande, bringing thousands of additional jobs to his economically struggling district. Further east, across Tucson’s suburbs and beyond, utilities, farms and residents are flocking to install solar in a bid to temper rising electricity prices.

And the SunZia transmission line, part of the country’s largest clean energy project, is set to carry gigawatts of wind power across the northern half of his district, transporting much-needed power to Phoenix and California.

But that growth is partly driven by incentives in Democrats’ 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has derided as the “Green New Scam” and Republican leaders are looking to cut to help pay for a massive tax, border security and energy package.

That is going to force dozens of rank-and-file Republicans like Ciscomani to make a difficult decision: resist Trump’s efforts to gut the IRA or incur the wrath of constituents who could lose billions of dollars in clean energy investments and tens of thousands of new jobs. But these lawmakers also risk drawing the ire of the president and his allies if they slow the final package or vote against it. The House Ways and Means Committee portion of the bill, released this week, would gut many of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits.

For Ciscomani, a rising star in the GOP who holds one of the most competitive House seats in the nation, the decision could be a pivotal one for his political future — and that of his party. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House, Trump endorsed Ciscomani’s bid for a third term last month. But Democrats — who have identified him as one of their top targets — are already preparing their attacks if he votes to cut clean energy programs or limit safety-net programs like Medicaid in the reconciliation package.

So far, Ciscomani has looked to toe the line. He has signed onto two letters urging leadership to preserve at least some of the IRA’s credits, and met recently with Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), whose committee holds jurisdiction over the credits, to make his case.

“I’ve made it clear what I’m going to be fighting for,” Ciscomani said in an interview.

But he’ll have to make a decision once Republicans bring the full package to the floor, which they aim to do by Memorial Day. Ciscomani, along with other Republicans who have called to preserve the IRA, in March voted for the budget resolution that is allowing the GOP to attempt to pass the package without Democratic votes.

Kirsten Engel, a University of Arizona environmental law professor and former Democratic candidate who narrowly lost to Ciscomani in 2022 and 2024, said the climate law has been transformative for the district — and residents will be closely watching whether Ciscomani votes to protect it.

“It’s one thing to say that you support this — it’s another thing to actually vote in a manner that’s going to make sure that this money actually is available,” said Engel, who is not currently planning another run. “It seems like he’s trying to have his cake and eat it too.”

Ciscomani acknowledged he hasn’t yet drawn any red lines on the clean energy credits. But he emphasized how important they are to companies such as Lucid Motors, which he helped recruit to Arizona a decade ago as an aide to then-Republican Gov. Doug Ducey.

“As much as there are other aspects of the IRA we [Republicans] can disagree with, these tax credits have had an impact in my district — and on job creation, on investment, also national security, because of energy production and having wanted to bring that more domestically,” he said.

The clean energy boom has opened new doors for many of Ciscomani’s constituents, like Ruben Subia. When Subia left the military and returned home to Casa Grande, he figured he would have to follow many of his high school classmates to Phoenix or Tucson for a higher-paying job. But Lucid was hiring for its new factory, offering high-paying jobs right in town and a chance to put his skills in the trades to work. Subia became one of the first 1,000 employees at the plant, which has since expanded to 2,800 after it quadrupled its footprint last year.

The jobs at Lucid have been “life-changing” for many in Casa Grande, giving them the opportunity to buy a car or a house for the first time, said Subia, who now works in human resources. His two brothers, who are also veterans, have joined him at Lucid.

The IRA helped supercharge a manufacturing boom in the city of 64,000, a former agricultural and mining town. Proctor and Gamble and several semiconductor chemical manufacturers have followed Lucid to the area. Two copper mines that could eventually supply Lucid are in development on the city’s outskirts. And Central Arizona College launched a training center just outside town that has prepared thousands of locals to work at Lucid and the other factories.

Population and median income are up, and businesses are streaming back, buoyed by the wages from Lucid, which is now Pinal County’s largest employer. Target announced in February it would reopen a store in Casa Grande it closed in 2016.

Casa Grande Mayor Lisa Navarro Fitzgibbons, who has lived in the area since the 1970s, said the partisanship around the IRA credits “drives me crazy” because they have only brought jobs and growth to towns like hers.

“As we continue to see some of these cuts and changes in legislation, we are the ones that are struggling and scrambling,” said Fitzgibbons, who signed a letter alongside 15 other mayors in April urging lawmakers to preserve the full suite of credits. Fitzgibbons’ position is nonpartisan.

House Republicans’ proposal would eliminate all of the IRA’s consumer EV credits within two years and curtail the advanced manufacturing credit that has spurred a wave of factory investments across the country.

While Lucid’s factory was planned before the IRA passed, it benefits from the manufacturing incentive for the battery packs it assembles and the consumer EV tax credit for leased vehicles. The company also hopes to claim the EV credit for its upcoming cheaper midsize SUV, planned for 2026 release.

“It’s not that we won’t be here [if the credits are eliminated], but the growth curve will be a lot slower, the job opportunities will be less,” said Adrian Price, Lucid’s senior vice president of operations.

Price said the company aligns well with the Trump administration’s goals of bringing vehicle manufacturing back to the United States. Unlike many other manufacturers, Lucid does its stamping in-house in Casa Grande — meaning its cars enter the factory as massive coils of U.S.-sourced aluminum and drive out ready to be delivered.

But “manufacturing is a hugely capital-intensive business … and you have to be careful about how you invest and grow,” Price said. “Those credits and those opportunities are part of the fabric of how we structure the business to enable us to grow at the fastest rate we can.”

It’s not just Lucid that could feel the pain of the cuts in Ciscomani’s district. The region’s thriving solar industry is helping temper electricity prices amid surging power demand — but a combination of the uncertainty around tariffs and the tax credits has already led companies to pull back, said John Mitman, president of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association.

Utility rates in the region have surged in recent years, Mitman noted. “I think we’ll see even higher rate increases if [the credits for solar] go away, because it is really the primary source of most of that new generation capacity,” he said.

Mitman is founder and CEO of solar developer Obodo Energy, which just completed a 4-megawatt solar installation at a commercial farm in Willcox, an agricultural town in the heart of Ciscomani’s district.

The project, which benefits from the tech-neutral clean electricity credit in the IRA, aims to fully offset power demand from three greenhouses, taking strain off the local grid and allowing the farm to grow more cucumbers and tomatoes, according to Mitman.

As produce-laden trucks make their way to Interstate 10, they pass under the hulking towers of the nearly-complete SunZia transmission line. The 550-mile-long project, expected to begin operations in 2026, will carry 3 gigawatts of wind energy from central New Mexico to power-hungry customers in Arizona.

A SunZia spokesperson said the line itself is not receiving IRA subsidies, but the wind project is eligible for the clean electricity credit for the power it generates. Republicans have proposed restricting that credit and moving up its sunset date.

Just a few miles south of Willcox, Sal Tirrito and his wife Yuri are building their dream property: a farmstead retreat focused around sustainable practices. Opposite the six luxury yurts for overnight guests, Tirrito has plans for a solar canopy over the parking lot, which would power the onsite cafe.

Tirrito was recently awarded a grant for the project under the Agriculture Department’s Rural Energy for America Program, which received a huge infusion from the IRA. But with the future of the funding uncertain, he has decided to hold off for now rather than front the money and hope to get reimbursed given its half-million dollar price tag.

Chris Donat, another Democratic candidate, pointed to the regular demonstrations against the Republican budget bill that Democrats and others are holding outside Ciscomani’s office in Tucson, saying voters are angry their lawmaker has not bucked Trump on clean energy and other issues and is “obviously afraid to stand up for what he at least originally believed in.”

National Democrats are also turning their attention to the tightly contested district. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) drew more than 10,000 people to a March rally in Tucson for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour while Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) held a town hall in April to highlight the impacts of potential Medicaid cuts — and point out Ciscomani has not held his own in-person town halls for constituents.

The cuts and limitations to the safety-net health program proposed by House Republicans to help pay for their bill further complicate Ciscomani’s calculus on the clean energy cuts. More than 30,000 adults in Ciscomani’s district are at risk of losing coverage while hospitals could be closed if federal funds dry up, according to research from Daniel Derksen, director of the University of Arizona Center for Rural Health.

Ciscomani was among the dozen Republicans to declare in April they would not vote for a bill that cuts Medicaid for vulnerable populations.

Ciscomani said in the interview that Medicaid is his only red line “so far,” but he dismissed his Democratic opponents’ claims that he would fold on the clean energy credits.

“These Democrats, they’re straight up just grasping at straws at this point,” Ciscomani said.

GOP state Sen. T.J. Shope, who represents Casa Grande and serves as president pro tempore, said he had “no doubt” Ciscomani — whom he has known for a decade — will be able to navigate the difficult decisions on the reconciliation bill.

“If history serves as any indicator, he does a very good job of walking a tightrope,” Shope said. “He does a very good job listening to his constituents.”",https://static.politico.com/1b/f8/047c13134d578d8a06a8ebe448de/main-bikales-azcleanenergy-lead.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 11:04:31.959484

Roy Cooper and current Gov. Josh Stein — hailed it as a victory after years of fighting for clean water in eastern North Carolina.

“This is the best PFAS day I’ve had in a quarter-century,” Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said during a speech at the announcement ceremony.

Just over a year later, much of the progress made on that day to remove the toxic chemicals from Americans’ drinking water, including 66,000 public water systems, could be reversed.

On Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the agency’s plans to scrap the limits for three of the five PFAS chemicals included in the landmark rule: 10 parts per trillion for PFHxS, PFNA and GenX (HFPO-DA). Limits of 4 ppt for PFOA and PFOS will remain in effect, Zeldin said. The administration is also extending the deadline for public water systems to meet the standards from 2029 to 2031, in an effort to give small and rural water systems more time to comply.

In addition to weakening the PFAS limits, the EPA will also “establish a federal exemption framework” for some utilities, the announcement said. The agency will also establish a new PFAS outreach initiative called PFAS OUT, which will help water systems comply with the EPA’s new limits.

Forever chemicals in the Cape Fear

PFAS are a group of about 15,000 toxic and pervasive chemicals colloquially referred to as “forever chemicals” for their inability to naturally break down in the environment and to build up in the human body. Exposure to PFAS is linked to numerous adverse health effects, including various cancers, heart disease, thyroid disease and reproductive issues.

Chemours, formerly known as DuPont, dumped PFAS and GenX from its Fayetteville Works plant, located on the Cumberland-Bladen County line, into the Cape Fear River for decades, contaminating the water supplies of hundreds of thousands in the Cape Fear River basin. PFAS researchers said in March that residents downstream of the Fayetteville Works plant on the Cape Fear River and those surrounding the facility have PFAS levels between two and four times higher than the national average.

In the EPA’s announcement, Zeldin said that the agency would keep standards in place for PFOA and PFOS, two legacy types of PFAS that have been phased out of production but remain present in water supplies. Both chemicals have been labeled as carcinogens by the World Health Organization, with no safe level of consumption.

“The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,” Zeldin said in the announcement. “We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.”

Zeldin’s announcement comes as knowledge of the extent and dangers of the PFAS contamination in eastern North Carolina continues to grow. The forever chemicals have leached into water, air and soil in the area surrounding the Fayetteville Works plant. In some areas, garden produce is unsafe to eat. Pets have suffered from ailments that developed after exposure to PFAS, while local residents have been diagnosed with cancers associated with the high levels of PFAS in their blood.

The United Nations has said DuPont and Chemours violated human rights law by polluting the Cape Fear River Basin with the toxic chemicals. Lawsuits against the companies, filed by local residents and governments over widespread water contamination, property damage and personal injury, have piled up. One case with over 2,500 individual plaintiffs is set to go to trial in the coming months, after Chemours and DuPont’s request for summary judgement was rejected by a district court judge on March 31.

Clear water advocacy groups decried Zeldin’s decision, including Emily Donovan, the co-founder of Clean Cape Fear. When she spoke at the EPA’s announcement event last April, Donovan said she was “deeply honored” and “overwhelmed with gratitude.” She criticized the Trump administration’s decision to water down the rules.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” Donovan said in a statement on Wednesday. “It’s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses. This is a clear victory for the trillion dollar chemical industry — not public health.”

Chemical industry lobbyists, meanwhile, are advocating for the Trump administration to further weaken the rules. The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical manufacturers that sued the EPA over the 2024 limits, pushed for further deregulation this week.

“EPA’s actions reflect efforts to address the concerns of water utilities and local governments, focus on national drinking water priorities, minimize the impact on water bills, and ensure consistency with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act,” the group said in a statement. “However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences.”

The removal of the GenX limit could also have ramifications for the 2019 Consent Order between Chemours, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and nonprofit group Cape Fear River Watch. Under the legal agreement, Chemours is required to test residential wells for PFAS contamination upon DEQ’s direction. If the compounds are detected above certain thresholds, Chemours must immediately provide affected households with bottled water or other filtration solutions.

Mike Watters, a prominent clean water advocate from Cumberland County, raised concerns that the removal of the EPA’s GenX limit could also influence or lead to the removal of the EPA’s health advisory for the chemical. The advisory is also 10 ppt, and while not enforceable, it is used by DEQ to determine whether residents qualify for alternative water sources. It applies to North Carolina residents with private drinking water wells in 10 counties, including six counties in the upper Cape Fear River Basin and four counties in the lower Cape Fear River Basin.

“It is very troubling to see this direction by the EPA under Lee Zeldin,” Watters said.

Public News Service

A new data dashboard from the Sierra Club showed more Kentuckians would be at risk for higher exposure to air and water pollution if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency follows through on plans to loosen several environmental regulations.

Targets for rollbacks include regional haze, greenhouse gas, mercury and air toxin standards, along with wastewater pollution rules and a recently implemented set of rules designed to curb nitrogen oxide emissions.

Julia Finch, director of the Kentucky chapter of the Sierra Club, said coal plants and industries in the Commonwealth would be allowed to emit more pollution into neighboring communities.

“It’s a divestment from the health of Kentuckians,” Finch argued. “As much as the narrative is out there that rolling back regulations on coal will bring jobs into the area, the fact of the matter is, that there’s just no data to support that.”

Nationwide, the dashboard showed more than 532 million metric tons more carbon dioxide would be emitted, along with more than 2,500 more tons of fine particulate matter and 868 more pounds of mercury if the pollution standards are rolled back.

Despite improvements in air quality over the past two decades, Finch added, Kentucky still ranks at the top of states in asthma cases and lung disease. She emphasized children and elderly people are especially vulnerable to the effects of air and water pollution.

“This is not a sacrifice zone,” Finch stressed. “This is not a place to continue to extract resources from. This is a place where people are literally fighting for their lives and fighting for stronger regulation.”

The St-Jérôme, Que.-based manufacturer made the announcement Thursday evening, after a months-long search for a buyer that nearly came up empty.

The agreement comes after the Quebec government refused to inject more public funds directly into Lion Electric, which sought protection from its creditors in December. However, the province announced it would pump nearly $500 million into a subsidy program for electric school buses that will benefit the company.

The consortium of investors is led by Pierre Wilkie, a director of the company, and Vincent Chiara, president of Montreal real estate developer Groupe MACH. Lion Electric will present the deal to a Quebec Superior Court judge on Wednesday.

A previous offer by the group of investors fell through after Quebec Economy Minister Christine Fréchette announced last month that it would be irresponsible to invest more government money in Lion Electric, which manufactured electric school buses and trucks. News reports said the investors were seeking $24 million in public funds.

The province has already invested heavily in the company, and Premier François Legault has said the government stands to lose about $140 million.

After that deal failed, a representative of the court-appointed monitor for the company said Lion Electric would likely face liquidation.

But last week, the investors made a new, reduced offer after receiving confirmation that Quebec would renew its subsidy program for electric school buses, which had expired in March.

""It wasn't easy to get to where we are this morning,"" said Guy Martel, a lawyer representing Lion Electric, during a court hearing on Friday. ""It's a result, but it's still not what we had hoped for at the very beginning of the process.""

Under the terms of the agreement, Lion Electric will preserve its manufacturing plant in St-Jérôme, but will permanently lay off some employees.

On Thursday, the government released details of the new subsidy program for electric school buses, which will now offer rebates of $240,000 on each bus purchase, up from a maximum of $175,000. That program has been a key to Lion's success in Quebec, in part because buses must be assembled in Canada to be eligible.

Quebec is aiming to electrify 65 per cent of its school bus fleet by 2030, and the new program will run until 2028, with a budget of $480 million. The provincial government says there are about 1,600 electric school buses in Quebec, out of a total fleet of around 11,500 buses. About 1,175 of the electric buses were manufactured by Lion.

Even as it renewed the subsidy program, however, Quebec scrapped a requirement in place since 2021 that all new school bus purchases be electric. ""Operators will now be able to choose between electric or thermal … buses to renew their fleet,"" a spokesperson for Transport Minister Geneviève Guilbault said in a statement.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation's air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

""The law is very clear that the EPA can't repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,"" said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

""However, EPA's actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,"" the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

""This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,"" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/864a7ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F00%2F3d%2F37308cf745ad949a962bae70eb68%2Fap25134487196604.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 11:05:28.943197

Facing stiff emissions reduction requirements, several countries are starting to re-assess nuclear power and are looking at building plants that are not as expensive, risky, or politically unpalatable as conventional nuclear.

Generally ,less than 300 MWe, SMRs are cheaper and can be built more quickly than large nuclear reactors, which are typically 1,000 MW and have a large footprint. Interest in small reactors is driven by a desire to reduce capital costs and to provide power away from large grid systems.

SMRs are constructed with prefabricated modules and can be transported by truck or by rail — making them ideal for remote locations where a conventional reactor would not be feasible. Another important advantage is they are less likely to overheat, because their small cores produce less heat than those of large reactors. They also have fewer moving parts, including coolant pumps, which reduces the likelihood of failures that could cause an accident. The fuel, steam and generator are all in one vessel.

Their small size and lower cost compared to large nuclear reactors makes Small Modular Reactors more versatile, meaning significantly more utilities will be able to use them.

In Canada, SMRs are considered ideal for deployment to off-grid, remote locations such as mine sites or the oil sands, as well as communities in northern Canada reliant on diesel-fueled generators for electricity.

Small nuclear reactors are also being eyed by industrial producers as carbon-free sources of heat.

Other SMRs in the works

In addition to OPG, other utilities including Saskatchewan’s SaskPower and the Tennessee Valley Authority have expressed interest in building BWRX 300s, as have companies in Poland and Estonia, The Globe and Mail reports.

Meanwhile Westinghouse, which built the world’s first commercial pressurized water reactor in Shippingport, PA, in 2023 announced the launch of a smaller version of its flagship AP1000 nuclear reactor. The unit is, like the BWRX 300, able to generate 300 MW of electricity, versus 1,200 MW for the AP1000. It is expected to be available in 2027, at a cost of USD$1 billion per unit — significantly less than the $6.8B estimated to bring an AP1000 online.

Some of the most advanced research on SMR technology is being conducted in New Brunswick.

NB Power is currently working with two private-sector partners, ARC Clean Technology and Moltex Energy, to advance Generation IV Plus Grid-sized SMR technology for use in the Maritime province.

In 2023, the New Brunswick government signed an agreement with the government of Saskatchewan to further enhance collaboration on the development and deployment of SMRs.

The Western Canadian province is considering the same BWRX 300 Small Nuclear Reactor as Ontario.

While no SMRs have yet been built in the United States, the Department of Energy has announced up to $5.5B in funding.

According to my colleague Felicity Bradstock, an increasing number of tech companies are investing in SMR technology with the hopes of powering their high-energy-demand data centers with clean energy. The sector hopes SMR technology will be available to power several data centers by the 2030s, as their power demand grows in line with the rollout of artificial intelligence and other complex technologies. This has led Google to order seven SMRs, and Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta to follow suit.

Bill Gates’s Terrapower is one of the US companies currently building SMRs. Terrapower broke ground on its first project in Wyoming last August and is awaiting approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, expected by the end of 2026.

Further afield, France announced USD$1.1 billion to develop an SMR design. In the UK, Rolls-Royce is around 18 months ahead of the competition in developing SMR technology.

In the Netherlands, the nuclear startup Thorizon announced a new consortium to develop a molten salt-type SMR.

The firm is currently building a 100-MW Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), Thorizon One, which it hopes to get running in a pilot plant by the mid-2030s. It expects the first prototype to be fueled by a mix of long-lived radioactive waste from existing nuclear facilities and thorium. This will transform much of the long-lived waste into short-lived waste.

MSRs are powered by a radioactive solution that blends fissionable isotopes with a liquid salt. While they can be powered using uranium, they run optimally on thorium, a cleaner, safer, and more abundant nuclear fuel.

The SMR market is expected to grow from $6 billion in 2024 to $7.14 billion in 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3 percent. The Asia Pacific and Americas markets will likely be the main drivers of this growth.

In the past, policies favored traditional energy sources while overlooking the promise of renewables. Today, the focus has shifted entirely to renewable energy while neglectfully disregarding the consequences for the workforce, consumers and the grid. The rapid push toward a carbon-free, all electric grid has come at a high cost—eliminating jobs, driving up energy bills, and, perhaps most concerning, revealing itself to be both unrealistic and unattainable.

For once, Albany has a realistic, forward-looking alternative Senator Kevin Parker (D-Brooklyn), Chair of the Senate Energy Committee along with Senator Sean Ryan (D-Buffalo) and Assemblyman William Conrad (D-Tonawanda) have introduced a package of bills that will, for the first time, shift New York’s energy strategy from subtraction to addition.

Together, this legislative package strikes a smart balance – simultaneously prioritizing jobs, affordable energy, and emissions reductions. We have always known that reducing energy usage is a key component for cutting emissions. One of the most effective ways to do that is through improving insulation and weatherization in homes and buildings. The bill sponsored by Senator Ryan and Assemblyman Conrad would do just that – creating good paying union jobs while reducing emissions. It’s a true win-win scenario.

Meanwhile, Senator Parker has introduced a suite of four bills that reflect a comprehensive vision for our energy future. His proposals would preserve existing natural gas jobs while also creating new ones. Through hybrid heating programs that integrate heat pump technology, accelerating the development of renewable natural gas, supporting clean hydrogen technology and advancing carbon capture projects to reduce emissions.

Together these bills chart a realistic and inclusive path forward – one that maintains vital energy jobs, creates new opportunities in clean energy and efficiency, and continued growth of renewable energy at a sustainable pace.

This package of bills is proof that New York can correct courses. We do not have to choose between jobs and emissions reductions. We can have both. And we can do it without sacrificing the employees that have kept our energy systems running for decades.

With the legislative session quickly drawing to a close, we urge lawmakers to take swift action on this package of bills. New York has always been a leader in innovation.

The moment is now upon us — and the outlook for the IRA after the release of House Republicans’ mega budget bill ranges from bleak to dead, depending on who you ask.

This is just a first draft, and the provisions — including the rollback of key tax credits — are subject to change, likely depending on how effectively members such as Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) push for them (and what happens in the Senate).

Let’s get into it.

The News of the Week: IRA rollback

When Ways & Means Republicans released their portion of the “big, beautiful bill” Monday, clean energy advocates were dismayed. After a lengthy lobbying blitz, Republicans’ approach veered more toward a gutting of the bill — phasing out key credits and hampering the ones that have been preserved — rather than a more fine-tuned one.

Here’s what the bill would do:

Cut two key demand-side credits — 30D, which provides a consumer tax credit for American-sourced electric vehicle purchases, and 25D, a subsidy for rooftop solar — by the end of the year.

Phase down investment and production tax credits starting in 2029, with a full phasedown by 2031. Clean energy advocates were happy to see their tech-neutrality maintained — there were fears that solar, in particular, could be cut out.

Begin to phase down the 45X manufacturing tax credit — a source of financing for critical minerals operations and battery and solar manufacturing — in 2031.

End transferability for tax credits after 2027, a key tool for project financing flexibility that allows companies — many of which do not yet pay taxes or have limited liability because they’re not yet generating income — to sell their tax credits and carry them forward.

Change the eligibility rules for tax credits so that projects must be “placed in service” rather than having begun construction to claim them.

Create a complex web of “foreign entity of concern” provisions, many of which would need to be litigated in rulemaking, that limit companies’ ability to source parts or work with companies that have ownership interests from countries (namely China) that the U.S. has deemed to be national security risks.

The IRA helped create a veritable boom across the country — and in Northern Nevada in particular — in clean energy investment and helped build out U.S. supply chains for renewable parts, many of which had never been manufactured or processed in the U.S. before.

Read more about the IRA’s impact in Nevada, and how an IRA rollback would affect the lithium loop and the solar industry.

In Nevada specifically, the Clean Investment Monitor estimates that companies have announced about $28.3 billion in low-carbon energy investments in the state since the IRA’s passage — which brings jobs and workforce development programs. Of that, $15.4 billion is still unspent. Announced projects that have yet to break ground are the ones that could be most imperiled by the rollback, between the limits on financing and the foreign entity of concern rules, given that some parts and technology do not yet exist outside of China.

“Members of Congress should not be surprised if this bill passes as drafted, and over the next several years, a lot of projects that have been announced that people are excited about are significantly scaled down or do not move forward at all,” said Albert Gore III, the president of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which has lobbied on behalf of tax credits that benefit the electric vehicle and battery supply chain, including for companies in Nevada.

Gore was particularly dismayed by the early phasedown of the manufacturing 45X tax credit and the complete cut of the 30D consumer tax credit. He said that those credits worked in tandem to incentivize automakers to onshore their operations, including sourcing lithium in the U.S.

Nevada, which has the only operating lithium mine in the U.S., has big plans for the critical mineral that exists abundantly in the state and powers EV batteries. Projects such as Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge have received massive federal loans to build mining projects in the state, and have already signed offtake agreements with large automakers.

But industry advocates warn that battery makers and automakers were pursuing American lithium — including Nevada’s — because of the tax credits, which allowed them to source American lithium at a price point that was competitive with foreign-mined and processed lithium.

“I have a hard time thinking that the economic opportunity, the business forecast, the investment forecasts for the lithium loop that that have existed the past couple years in Nevada can endure and continue in the present state, given the demand destruction,” said Harry Godfrey, a managing director at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United.

And even though the most important tax credit to Nevada — the manufacturing 45X credit — was maintained through 2031, Gore cautioned that the early phasedown, the incredibly tight foreign entity of concern provisions and the requirement that projects be in service will hamper future growth, including with announced projects. Mining, refining and manufacturing projects can take a decade, if not longer, to move through permitting and construction phases. Companies may now find the credit — and some of the market demand — gone by the time they’re ready to produce.

And in a macro sense, advocates — and members of Congress — are worried about the bill leading to energy costs rising. The IRA tax credits were intended to allow companies to move more quickly to generate new clean energy to add to the grid and help meet increasing demand. Without that, states may have to rely more on natural gas.

According to a study by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, repealing two key credits (which the Republican bill targeted for early phasedown) could lead to electricity prices being 7.3 percent higher for Nevada households from 2026 to 2032.

Some industry advocates expressed optimism that the proposal would be tweaked. Senate Republicans — several of whom want to maintain subsidies for less mature technologies — have already balked at some of the provisions.

The Nevada Angle

In March, Amodei told me that preservation of 45X (manufacturing) and 30D (consumer EV credits) were red lines for him. On Tuesday, he was less stringent on 30D, saying that the EV industry will continue to grow regardless and that the demand for Nevada lithium is not reliant on the credit.

“We're pushing all the lithium stuff, pushing all the recycling stuff,” Amodei said. “I think there's definitely demand there. I don't think they need that credit to keep their place.”

Industry insiders agreed that the demand for lithium will persist, but that Nevada-made lithium may not be able to compete without the consumer tax credit.

But he and 12 other Republicans passionate about the preservation of key credits have already made a list of demands for leadership — changes to the foreign entity of concern provisions, restoring transferability and going back to the construction standard instead of the new “in service” requirement.

However, none threatened to withhold their vote.

Amodei said he met with advocates this week to formulate a lobbying plan for their most important asks.

“Now we got some time to put together a lobbying plan,” he said. “How do we fine tune this to make it even more [helpful] for the Teslas and Redwood [Materials]?”

The Impact

Growing the renewable energy industry in Nevada has been a bipartisan endeavor at the federal and state levels, with the geographic blessings of lithium and sunshine an appealing pathway to diversify the state’s economy beyond gaming.

This is just the first draft, and much of the negotiating will occur behind the scenes. But I’ll be monitoring how key stakeholders engage with the bill, especially when the Senate gets its say.

Around the Capitol

💦Colorado River concerns — Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) is raising a new concern over the Utah public land sales included in the reconciliation bill. Lee and Rep. Greg Stanton (D-AZ) say the parcels align with a planned route for the Lake Powell pipeline, which brings water from the Colorado River to Utah and could potentially upset negotiations over the river’s water usage.

Lee again called on Amodei to withdraw those portions of the bill.

🏭Apex authorization — Rep. Steven Horsford’s (D-NV) bill — which makes technical corrections to the Apex Site land by allowing Clark County to develop projects that produce hazardous byproducts on the federal land without specific approvals — passed the House by a voice vote.

More data centers have opened in Virginia than in any other state.","Individuals and small business have been paying more for power in recent years, and their electricity rates may climb higher still.

That’s because the cost of the power plants, transmission lines and other equipment that utilities need to serve data centers, factories and other large users of electricity is likely to be spread to everybody who uses electricity, according to a new report.

The report by Wood MacKenzie, an energy research firm, examined 20 large power users. In almost all of those cases, the firm found, the money that large energy users paid to electric utilities would not be enough to cover the cost of the equipment needed to serve them. The rest of the costs would be borne by other utility customers or the utility itself.

The utilities “either need to socialize the cost to other ratepayers or absorb that cost — essentially, their shareholders would take the hit,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, who is the global head of grid edge research for Wood MacKenzie.

This is not a theoretical dilemma for utilities and the state officials who oversee their operations and approve or reject their rates. Electricity demand is expected to grow substantially over the next several decades as technology companies build large data centers for their artificial intelligence businesses. Electricity demand in some parts of the United States is expected to increase as much as 15 percent over just the next four years after several decades of little or no growth.

The rapid increase in data centers, which use electricity to power computer servers and keep them cool, has strained many utilities. Demand is also growing because of new factories and the greater use of electric cars and electric heating and cooling.

In addition to investing to meet demand, utilities are spending billions of dollars to harden their systems against wildfires, hurricanes, heat waves, winter storms and other extreme weather. Natural disasters, many of which are linked to climate change, have made the United States’ aging power grids more unreliable.

That spending is one of the main reasons that electricity rates have been rising in recent years.

American homes that use a typical 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity a month paid, on average, about $164 in February, according to the Energy Information Administration. That was up more than $30 from five years ago.

Dominion Energy, a large investor-owned utility based in Richmond, Va., is one of those that Wood MacKenzie expects will spend more on new infrastructure than it will be able to recover from selling electricity to data centers and other large users. More data centers have opened in Virginia than in any other state.

Asked about Wood MacKenzie’s filings, Dominion said that on April 1 it filed a proposal to electricity regulators in Virginia for requiring large-load customers to pay their “fair share” of utility costs.

“Ensuring a fair allocation of costs and mitigating financial risk are not new concepts to the company,” Edward H. Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia, said in testimony that Dominion submitted to state regulators and provided to The New York Times. “Addressing both the needs and the risks associated with growth in high-load electric customers with high-load factors is both a public policy and a regulatory priority for Virginia.”

A 2024 analysis by Virginia officials concluded that data centers paid the full cost of the service they received. But that report warned that the addition of many more large users of electricity could raise rates for all users if the state did not make policy changes to protect individuals and small businesses.

Wood MacKenzie’s report found that some states do have policies to protect individuals and small businesses from higher rates. Chief among them is Texas, where customers can pick a power source that is different from the utility that maintains the lines that deliver electricity to their homes.

This arrangement, according to Wood MacKenzie, helps protect individuals from having to pay for grid upgrades that mainly or entirely benefit large users.

Mr. Hertz-Shargel said many utilities also had programs that allowed large electricity users to buy emissions-free energy directly from power producers like solar and wind farms. Such programs, he said, could be refashioned to help ensure that the cost of new power projects is largely or entirely borne by the users responsible for major grid upgrades.

The policies that states and utilities have put in place will significantly reduce risks of spreading the costs of improvements for the large-load customers, but “they do not provide complete protection,” Mr. Hertz-Shargel said. “Only by removing data-center-caused infrastructure from utilities books, such as by allowing large loads to contract with third parties for generation via clean transition tariffs, are both ratepayers and utility shareholders fully protected.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/multimedia/00biz-energy-costs-vmwh/00biz-energy-costs-vmwh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 07:02:46.660981

Ciscomani could resist Republican House leaders’ efforts to gut Biden’s hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax breaks — helping pay for a small portion of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending megabill.
Back to Casa Grande For Ciscomani, the stakes are high.
Target announced in February it would reopen a store in Casa Grande that it had closed in 2016.
Adrian Price, Lucid’s senior vice president of operations, told James that if Republicans eliminate Biden’s tax credits, the company would remain in Casa Grande.","Former President Joe Biden’s climate law helped supercharge a clean energy manufacturing boom in the small city of Casa Grande, Arizona.

Now those economic gains are caught up in the GOP’s internal war over the fate of former President Joe Biden’s climate legacy. And that is creating a tough choice for the swing House district’s Republican representative, Juan Ciscomani, writes James Bikales.

Ciscomani could resist Republican House leaders’ efforts to gut Biden’s hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax breaks — helping pay for a small portion of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending megabill. Or he could go along with the cuts, risking the wrath of constituents who could lose billions of dollars in new investments and tens of thousands of new jobs.

Ciscomani is not alone. He is one of a group of Republican lawmakers who for months have been urging their leaders to spare at least some of the tax credits. But now they have to decide how hard to press those demands — and whether they are willing to tank a major part of Trump’s agenda if they don’t get their way.

It’s just one of myriad obstacles facing the megabill, which the House Budget Committee rejected this morning amid hard-line conservatives’ demands for a complete rollback of the clean energy tax credits and steeper cuts in programs such as Medicaid. Now, stay tuned for what version of the bill emerges from the coming weekend of negotiations.

Back to Casa Grande

For Ciscomani, the stakes are high. Since he took office in 2023, electric car manufacturer Lucid Motors quadrupled the size of its plant in Casa Grande, bringing thousands of additional jobs to the former agricultural and mining community.

As James writes, Procter & Gamble and several semiconductor chemical manufacturers followed Lucid to the area. Two copper mines that could eventually serve Lucid are in development on the city’s outskirts. Central Arizona College launched a training center that is preparing thousands of local residents to work at Lucid and the other factories.

Buoyed by the higher wages from Lucid, population and median income are up in the area, and businesses are streaming back. Target announced in February it would reopen a store in Casa Grande that it had closed in 2016. The boom means that many residents can buy a car or a house for the first time, one Lucid employee told James.

Separately, the SunZia transmission line, part of the country’s largest clean energy project, is set to carry massive amounts of wind power across the northern half of Ciscomani’s district, transporting much-needed power to Phoenix and California.

Adrian Price, Lucid’s senior vice president of operations, told James that if Republicans eliminate Biden’s tax credits, the company would remain in Casa Grande. But the company’s growth would slow and job opportunities would dwindle.

“Manufacturing is a hugely capital-intensive business ... and you have to be careful about how you invest and grow,” Price said. “Those credits and those opportunities are part of the fabric of how we structure the business to enable us to grow at the fastest rate we can.”

Power Centers

One word to ruin them all

The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed repeal of the nation’s climate rule for power plants could hinge on a single word: “Significantly,” writes Jean Chemnick.

Section 111 of the Clean Air Act asks EPA to determine whether a power plant “causes, or contributes significantly” to harmful air pollution. Conservative legal experts say that EPA could reinterpret “significantly” to downplay carbon pollution’s role in global warming.

Electricity costs climb, despite Trump’s promises

On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to cut energy costs in half. But retail electricity prices are expected to continue a rapid rise this year, with the average price increasing 13 percent from 2022 to 2025, writes Jason Plautz.

The rate of increase could be even higher in the Pacific region, where prices are forecast to rise 26 percent in that time, as well as in New England and the mid-Atlantic regions, which are both forecast to see 19 percent increases.

Greenland snubs Trump with EU musings

Greenland’s foreign minister has suggested the European Union could develop its coveted mineral resources amid Trump’s threat to seize the island, writes Seb Starcevic.

With its vast caches of rare earths and strategic location in the Arctic, Greenland — a self-ruling Danish territory with a population of around 60,000 — has became an increasingly important geopolitical player whose global profile has been elevated by Trump’s aggressive overtures.

Should we panic, or be grateful?","Sammy Roth, Sammy Roth Climate Columnist, www.latimes.com, sammy-roth",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-05-15/nuclear-reactors-power-los-angeles-should-we-panic-or-celebrate,"That’s right: If you live in Los Angeles County, there’s a good chance your computer, your phone, your refrigerator and your bedside lamp are powered, at least some of the time, by nuclear reactors.
Nuclear plants including Palo Verde generate nearly one-fifth of the nation’s electricity, churning out 24/7, emissions-free power.
The benefits of nuclear reactors are straightforward: They generate climate-friendly electricity around the clock, while taking up far less land than solar or wind farms.
For the record: An earlier version of this column used the wrong name for a nuclear plant in Washington state.
To the extent existing nuclear plants limit the amount of new infrastructure we need to build to replace fossil fuels: good.","The radiation containment domes at Arizona’s Palo Verde Generating Station were, truth be told, pretty boring to look at: giant mounds of concrete, snap a picture, move on. The enormous cooling towers and evaporation ponds were marginally more interesting — all that recycled water, baking in the Sonoran Desert.

You know what really struck my fancy, though? The paintings on conference room walls.

There were five of them, each representing one of the far-flung Southwestern cityscapes powered by Palo Verde. Two showcased Arizona: one for the Phoenix metro area — saguaro cacti and ocotillo in the foreground, freeway and skyscrapers in the background — and one for the red-rock country to the north. Another showed downtown Albuquerque. A fourth portrayed farm fields in El Paso, likely irrigated with water from the Rio Grande.

Then there was an image that may have looked familiar to Southern Californians: Pacific Coast Highway, twisting through a seaside neighborhood that looks very much like Malibu before the Palisades fire.

That’s right: If you live in Los Angeles County, there’s a good chance your computer, your phone, your refrigerator and your bedside lamp are powered, at least some of the time, by nuclear reactors.

The city of L.A., Southern California Edison and a government authority composed of cities including Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena all own stakes in Palo Verde, the nation’s second-largest power plant. In 2023, the most recent year for which data are available, the plant was L.A.’s single largest energy source, supplying nearly 14% of the city’s electricity. The reactors supplied just over 9% of Edison’s power.

During a tour last month, I walked past the switchyard, a tangle of poles and wires where energy is transferred to power lines marching west and east. When all three reactors are running, the yard can transfer “the equivalent of half of the peak [electric demand] of the state of California on its hottest day,” according to John Hernandez, vice president of site services for utility company Arizona Public Service, which runs the plant.

“So it is a massive, massive switchyard,” Hernandez said.

For all the heated debate over the merits of nuclear energy as a climate change solution, the reality is it’s already a climate change solution. Nuclear plants including Palo Verde generate nearly one-fifth of the nation’s electricity, churning out 24/7, emissions-free power. Shutting down the nuclear fleet tomorrow would cause a giant uptick in coal and gas combustion, worsening the heat waves, wildfires and storms of the climate crisis.

Phasing out the nation’s 94 nuclear reactors over a period of decades, on the other hand, might be manageable — and there’s a case to be made for it. Extracting uranium for use as nuclear fuel has left extensive groundwater contamination and air pollution across the Southwest, especially on tribal lands, including the Navajo Nation.

“When we talk about nuclear, thoughts often go toward spent fuel storage, or the safety of reactors themselves,” said Amber Reimondo, energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit conservation group. “But I think an often overlooked piece...has been the impacts to those who are at the beginning of the supply chain.”

Reimondo participated in a panel that I moderated at Palo Verde, part of the annual conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists. She noted that the nation’s only active conventional uranium mill — where uranium is leached from crushed rock — is located in Utah, just a few miles from the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation.

Even during the Biden years, Reimondo said, it was tough to overcome bipartisan enthusiasm for nuclear energy and “get folks to take seriously the impacts that [tribal] communities are feeling” from mining and milling.

“We just haven’t reached a place in this country where we are listening to these folks,” she said.

That dynamic has remained true during the second Trump administration. Just this week, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said his agency would fast-track permitting for a uranium mine proposed by Anfield Energy in Utah’s San Juan County, completing the environmental review — which would normally take a year — in just 14 days.

Burgum and President Trump, like Biden-era officials before them, say it’s unwise for the U.S. to rely on overseas suppliers for nearly all its uranium. But many environmental activists, even some who are fans of nuclear, believe running roughshod over Indigenous nations and public lands is disgraceful. And counterproductive.

Victor Ibarra Jr., senior manager for nuclear energy at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force, said rebuilding the U.S. nuclear power supply chain will require local buy-in — on the front end, where uranium is mined, and on the back end, where spent fuel is stored. Thus far, political opposition has derailed every attempt to build a permanent fuel storage site, meaning nuclear waste is piling up at power plants across the country.

If there’s any hope for more uranium mining and power plants, Ibarra said, it will involve a lot of conversations — conversations that lead to less pollution, and fewer mistakes like those made during the 20th century.

“I think it’s really unfortunate that the nuclear industry has behaved the way it has in the past,” he said.

The benefits of nuclear reactors are straightforward: They generate climate-friendly electricity around the clock, while taking up far less land than solar or wind farms. If building new nuclear plants were cheap and easy — and we could solve the lingering pollution and safety concerns — then doing so would be a climate no-brainer.

If only.

The only two nuclear reactors built in the U.S. in decades came online at Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant in 2023 and 2024, respectively, and cost $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. That was $17 billion over budget.

Meanwhile, efforts to build small modular reactors have proved more expensive than large nuclear plants.

“It would really be quite unprecedented in the history of engineering, and in the history of energy, for something that is much smaller to have a lower price per megawatt,” said Joe Romm, a senior researcher at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media. “We try to make use of the economies of scale.”

Those setbacks haven’t stopped wealthy investors including billionaires Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos from bankrolling efforts to bring down the cost of small modular reactors, in hopes that mini-nuclear plants will someday join solar panels and wind turbines as crucial tools in replacing planet-warming fossil fuels.

I hope they succeed. But I’m not going to spend much time worrying about it.

For the record:

An earlier version of this column used the wrong name for a nuclear plant in Washington state. It’s Columbia Generating Station, not Centralia. Centralia is a coal plant.

Like I said earlier: Love it or hate it, nuclear is already a huge part of the nation’s power mix, including here in L.A. We’ve lived with it, almost always safely, for decades — at Palo Verde, at Washington state’s Columbia Generating Station, at the Diablo Canyon plant on California’s Central Coast. Nuclear, for all its flaws, is hardly the apocalyptic threat to humanity that its most righteous detractors make it out to be.

It’s also not the One True Solution to humanity’s energy woes, as many of its techno-optimist devotees claim it to be. There’s a reason that solar, wind and batteries made up nearly 94% of new power capacity built in the U.S. last year: They’re cheap. And although other technologies will be needed to help solar and wind phase out fossil fuels, some researchers have found that transitioning to 100% clean energy is possible even without nuclear.

So what’s the answer? Is nuclear power good or bad?

I wish it were that simple. To the extent existing nuclear plants limit the amount of new infrastructure we need to build to replace fossil fuels: good. To the extent we’re unable to eliminate pollution from uranium mining: bad. To the extent small reactors might give us another tool to complement solar and wind, alongside stuff like advanced geothermal — good, although we probably shouldn’t spend too much more taxpayer money on it yet.

Sorry not to offer up more enthusiasm, or more outrage. The climate crisis is a big, thorny problem that demands nuance and thoughtful reflection. Not every question can be answered with a snappy soundbite.

Before leaving Palo Verde, I stopped by the conference room for a last look at the paintings: Arizona. New Mexico. Texas. California. It was strange to think this plant was responsible for powering so many different places.

It was strange to think the uranium concealed beneath those domes could power so many different places.

Democrats say they will fight what House party leader Hakeem Jeffries calls “this extreme and toxic bill.”

Here’s a look at what’s in and out of the legislative package so far.

Tax cuts for individuals and businesses

Central to the GOP package is more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, according to an estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation — costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code.

Republicans look to make permanent the individual income tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term, in 2017, plus enact promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail to not tax tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans.

To partially offset the lost revenue, Republicans propose repealing or phasing out more quickly the clean energy tax credits passed during Joe Biden’s presidency, helping to bring down the overall cost of the tax portion to about $3.8 trillion.

But lawmakers from New York, California and other high-tax states say the boost for state and local tax deductions, called SALT, is insufficient. As proposed, it rises from $10,000 to $30,000 for joint filers making less than $400,000 per year. They are pushing for more.

The bill also includes a temporary $2,000 boost to the standard deduction, bringing it to $32,000 for joint filers. And there is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500.

The estate tax exemption raises to $15 million.

Several of the provisions Trump touted on the campaign trail would be temporary, lasting roughly through his second term in office. The tax breaks for tips, overtime and car loan interest expire at the end of 2028. That’s also the case for a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.

Parents and older Americans face work requirements for food assistance

House Republicans are looking to shift some of the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to the states.

States would shoulder 5 percent of benefit costs, beginning in fiscal 2028, and 75 percent of the administrative costs. Currently, states pay none of the benefit and half of the administration costs.

Republicans also are expanding the work requirements to receive food aid. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents must fulfill work requirements until they are 54, and that would change under the bill to age 64.

Also, some parents are currently exempt from work requirements until their children are 18; that would change so only those caring for a dependent child under the age of 7 are exempt.

At the same time, the legislation would invest $60 billion in new money for agriculture programs, sending aid to farmers.

And new work requirements for Medicaid

A focal point of the package is nearly $800 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program.

To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new “community engagement requirements” of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirement would not kick in until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump leaves office. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.

Republicans are looking to generate savings with new work requirements. But Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.

An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by at least 7.6 million from the Medicaid changes, and possibly more with other changes to the Affordable Care Act.

Applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.

No taxes on gun silencers, no money for Planned Parenthood and more

Republicans are also using the package to reward allies and disadvantage political foes.

The package would eliminate a $200 tax on gun silencers that has existed since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934. The elimination of the tax is supported by the NRA.

The group Giffords, which works to reduce gun violence, said silencers make it more difficult to recognize the sound of gunfire and locate the source of gunshots, impairing the ability of law enforcement to respond to active shooters.

Republicans are also looking to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care. Democrats say defunding the organization would make it harder for millions of patients to get cancer screenings, pap tests and birth control.

And the bill would allow the Trump administration to remove the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that it says support terrorism. That will create what some nonprofits say is an arbitrary standard to financially punish charities that advocate for issues that don’t align with Trump’s agenda.

‘MAGA’ kids $1,000 savings accounts

“MAGA” is shorthand for Trump’s signature line, “Make America Great Again.” But in this case, it means “Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement.”

For parents or guardians who open new “MAGA” accounts for their children, the federal government will contribute $1,000 for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028.

Families could add $5,000 a year, with the account holders unable to take distributions before age 18. Then, they could access up to 50 percent of the money to pay for higher education, training and first-time home purchases. At age 30, account holders have access to the full balance of the account for any purpose.

Funding for Trump’s mass deportation operation

The legislation would provide $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money for the deportation agenda.

There’s $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses. There’s also funds for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.

It includes major changes to immigration policy, imposing a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum — something the nation has never done, putting it on par with few others, including Australia and Iran.

Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers.

More money for the Pentagon and Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’

There’s also nearly with $150 billion in new money for the Defense Department and national security.

It would provide $25 billion for Trump’s “Golden Dome for America,” a long-envisioned missile defense shield, $21 billion to restock the nation’s ammunition arsenal, $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding and some $5 billion for border security.

It also includes $9 billion for servicemember quality of life-related issues, including housing, health care and special pay.

Tax on university endowments and overhaul of student loans

A wholesale revamping of the student loan program is key to the legislation, providing $330 billion in budget cuts and savings.

The proposal would replace all existing student loan repayment plans with just two: a standard option with monthly payments spread out over 10 to 25 years and a “repayment assistance” plan that is generally less generous than those it would replace.

Among other changes, the bill would repeal Biden-era regulations that made it easier for borrowers to get loans canceled if their colleges defrauded them or closed suddenly.

There would be a tax increase, up to 21 percent, on some university endowments.

More drilling, mining on public lands

To generate revenue, one section would allow increased leasing of public lands for drilling, mining and logging while clearing the path for more development by speeding up government approvals.

Royalty rates paid by companies to extract oil, gas and coal would be cut, reversing Biden’s attempts to curb fossil fuels to help address climate change.

In a last-minute add, Republicans also included a provision authorizing sales of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah, prompting outrage from Democrats and environmentalists.
