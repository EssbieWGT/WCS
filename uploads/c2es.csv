Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, outlined the government’s plan to enable $1 trillion in total investments over the next five years in Canada.
The first five projects referred to the MPO in September collectively represent more than $60 billion in total capital investment.
Additional nation-building projects will be announced later this month and, taken together, this is expected to trigger at least $150 billion in total capital investment.
Budget 2025 launches bold pro-competitive measures to deliver lower prices, better service, and more choice for Canadians.","The world is increasingly dangerous and divided. Changes in the global trading system are causing massive disruptions and uncertainty for Canadians. In addition to that upheaval, business investment has been flat in Canada for a decade. This has caused productivity to grow by only 0.3% annually during that time – lagging behind the majority of our G7 partners. This has weighed on wages, job creation, and Canada’s prosperity.

Budget 2025: Canada Strong confronts these challenges head-on. This is Canada’s new government’s plan to mobilise investment and supercharge growth. We will harness our strengths to drive innovation and productivity – creating more high-paying careers, thriving businesses, and greater certainty for investors.

Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, outlined the government’s plan to enable $1 trillion in total investments over the next five years in Canada. Through targeted tax incentives, major infrastructure projects, stronger competition, and a bold new approach to attracting talent, Budget 2025 sets the foundation for long-term prosperity, so we can build the strongest economy in the G7.

The government’s plan to enable $1 trillion in total investments in five years includes the following measures:

Introducing a Productivity Super-Deduction to make it easier to do business and invest in Canada. Budget 2025 reinstates the Accelerated Investment Incentive and includes immediate expensing for manufacturing or processing machinery and equipment, clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment, and zero-emission technologies. It also moves forward with immediate expensing for productivity-enhancing assets and research capital expenditures for scientific research and experimental development, and introduces immediate expensing for new manufacturing or processing buildings and accelerated depreciation for low-carbon LNG facilities. Together, these measures form a Productivity Super-Deduction that will lower costs, spur private investment, and reduce Canada’s marginal effective tax rate to 13.2% – reinforcing Canada as the most tax-competitive country for new business investment in the G7.

Enhancing the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentives to help businesses innovate and grow. Budget 2025 moves forward with increasing the capital phase-out thresholds for the enhanced tax credit, extending the enhanced credit to eligible Canadian public corporations, and restoring the eligibility of capital expenditures. It also proposes increasing the annual expenditure limit on which the enhanced credit can be earned to $6 million.

Accelerating nation-building projects through the Major Projects Office (MPO) to supercharge growth across Canada. The new MPO serves as a single point of contact to fast-track transformative projects in energy, trade, transportation, and more. The first five projects referred to the MPO in September collectively represent more than $60 billion in total capital investment. Additional nation-building projects will be announced later this month and, taken together, this is expected to trigger at least $150 billion in total capital investment.

Launching the International Talent Attraction Strategy and Action Plan to make Canada a magnet for global talent. Budget 2025 invests $1.7 billion to recruit over 1,000 world-class researchers, attract top doctoral and post-doctoral fellows, and support universities in hiring internationally – positioning our immigration system to meet the needs of a modern, competitive economy.

Strengthening competition and consumer choice to lower costs and drive innovation. Budget 2025 launches bold pro-competitive measures to deliver lower prices, better service, and more choice for Canadians. It will boost telecom competition by cutting red tape, releasing new spectrum, and making it easier to switch providers. It will also advance open banking and modernise payments for Canadians through the forthcoming Real-Time Rail system. This, along with limits on non-compete clauses, will foster a fairer, more dynamic economy where Canadians pay less and get ahead.

Combined, these measures form a drastically different economic strategy to supercharge growth. Our plan focuses government spending where it delivers the highest return: in workers, businesses, and nation-building projects. This will drive lasting prosperity to help Canadians get ahead.

The story of China's clean tech exports is not one of dominance, but of interdependence and shared progress.
China's clean tech exports are more than trade flows; they are also a bridge between economies, technologies and environmental responsibility.","In a world racing to curb climate change, one country's industrial drive has become a cornerstone of the global energy transition.

In the first seven months of this year, China's exports of electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries — the essential pillars of the new energy economy — surged to $120 billion, including a record $20 billion in August alone, according to data from Ember, an energy think tank based in the United Kingdom.

By comparison, the United States' fossil fuel exports stood at around $80 billion in the first eight months of 2025.

While this is often framed as a geopolitical ""win"" for China and a ""loss"" for the West, this perspective misses the bigger, more optimistic picture.

This is far more than an economic milestone. It reflects how China's clean technology sector is helping to decarbonize the global economy, making sustainable energy solutions more affordable, accessible and scalable than ever before.

Perhaps the most profound impact of China's clean tech expansion has been the dramatic fall in renewable energy costs.

Over the past decade, solar panel prices have dropped over 80 percent, driven largely by Chinese manufacturing efficiency, innovation and economies of scale.

For many developing nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America, this cost revolution is transformative. Renewable energy — once a distant aspiration — is now the most economically viable path to sustainable growth. It allows countries to leapfrog outdated fossil-fuel systems and move directly to modern, low-carbon energy grids built on solar power, wind power and energy storage.

In this way, China's exports are democratizing clean energy access, enabling a green leap for emerging economies. Affordable solar panels and batteries are helping communities gain energy independence while advancing both climate resilience and inclusive development.

Meeting global climate targets depends not only on innovation but also on mass deployment — and that is where China's role is indispensable. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement on climate change require a transformation of the world's energy systems at a scale and speed never attempted before.

China's unparalleled manufacturing capacity is the engine powering this transformation. Every solar module, battery pack and electric vehicle exported and installed or used abroad contributes to the displacement of fossil fuels, preventing millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes.

By making clean technology cheaper than fossil alternatives, China has effectively aligned economic logic with environmental necessity — a crucial shift for achieving global net-zero goals. The results speak for themselves. In 2024, a record 92.5 percent of all newly installed power capacity worldwide came from renewable sources, with solar and wind power leading the surge. Clean energy now accounts for over 40 percent of global electricity generation, according to ""Renewable Capacity Statistics 2025"", a report released by the International Renewable Energy Agency in March.

A January report by Bloomberg-NEF noted that China remains the driving force behind this shift, having invested $818 billion in clean energy in 2024 — nearly two-thirds of global growth in the sector.

With national goals of adding 1,200 gigawatts of solar and wind power by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral before 2060, China's domestic transition is redefining not only its economy but also the trajectory of the global energy landscape, as cited in a report in India-based Saur Energy International magazine.

The expansion of clean tech industries has also redefined the nature of global cooperation. As demand for renewable technologies grows, new supply chains are forming — more diverse, interconnected and resilient.

Concepts like ""friend-shoring"" are not about isolation but about shared responsibility and interdependence. China's position as a manufacturing and innovation hub strengthens this network, providing the scale and reliability that underpin global supply stability.

At the same time, this dynamic encourages healthy competition and rapid innovation. While China's factories deliver current generation technologies at scale, the country is also investing heavily in next-generation research and development — from advanced batteries and green hydrogen to smart grids and digitalized energy systems.

Crucially, these efforts are not confined to within China's borders. Through joint ventures, technology transfer and overseas investment, Chinese companies are helping partner nations build their own green industrial bases. This fosters local employment, skills development and industrial diversification, ensuring that the benefits of the green transition are shared more equitably.

The story of China's clean tech exports is not one of dominance, but of interdependence and shared progress. The true beneficiary of this transformation is the planet itself, as clean, affordable technology becomes the global standard.

China's leadership in scaling and exporting renewable technologies demonstrates its growing role as a responsible global stakeholder, one using its industrial strength and innovation capacity to tackle one of humanity's greatest challenges.

Yet the next phase of the green transition must be deeply collaborative. To sustain momentum and ensure balanced growth, all regions — from Central Asia and Africa to Europe and Latin America — should work toward coordinated investment frameworks to scale green infrastructure and attract private capital; open technology ecosystems that promote transparent standards, fair competition and shared innovation; build regional manufacturing and training hubs that create human capital and reduce supply chain vulnerabilities; and ensure stronger international policy dialogue to align industrial, climate and trade agendas.

By strengthening collaboration rather than competition, the world can turn China's industrial success into a global sustainability success story — where technology, policy and partnership combine to accelerate decarbonization and economic inclusion alike.

China's clean tech exports are more than trade flows; they are also a bridge between economies, technologies and environmental responsibility. They show how one nation's industrial capacity can empower many others to achieve their climate goals more quickly and affordably.

As nations collectively strive toward carbon neutrality, cooperation — not fragmentation — will define success. Through sustained openness, innovation and mutual trust, China and its partners can help shape a future that is not only green, but also inclusive, resilient and shared by all.

The proposed First Energy gas plant has a capacity of 1,200 MW.
The math: 1200 MW (plant capacity) X $559,000 (delta in CP vs CC) = $671 million more for a new coal plant compared to a natural gas plant.
Market Reality At typical capacity factors (gas CC 78%, new coal 25%), PJM estimates the LCOE for a new combined-cycle gas plant around $46/MWh, compared with $378/MWh for a new coal unit.
If the so-called “Make Electricity More Expensive Act” passes, that new First Energy gas plant could be forced to sit idle so older, less efficient coal units can run instead.","First Energy last week announced plans to build a new natural gas–fired power plant at a yet-to-be-determined location in West Virginia. Newsman Mike Nolting filed a complete story.

That decision comes despite a legislative push – led by state senators Brian Helton, Rollan Roberts, and Chris Rose – to force coal-fired power plants in the state to run at least 69% of the time, regardless of market economics. Under that proposal, companies that don’t comply could lose the ability to file rate cases for cost recovery, not just for generation but potentially for transmission and distribution as well.

So Why Gas, Not Coal?

If coal-fired electricity truly drove down power bills, why wouldn’t First Energy simply build a coal plant? Either way, the company expands its rate base and earns a return on the investment. The cost of fuel itself – coal or gas – is a pass-through; utilities don’t make money on it.

So again, why not coal? Certainly, First Energy doesn’t need state senators on its back. Because it’s not in customers’ best interest, and FirstEnergy knows it.

The Economics Don’t Lie

Utilities can’t just build plants on a whim. They must prove to regulators, like the Public Service Commission, that the investment makes economic sense. One of the main tools used is the levelized cost of energy (LCOE)—essentially a long-term economic test of whether a project pencils out.

According to analysis of the 2024 State of the Market Report from PJM’s independent market monitor, Monitoring Analytics, LLC, the 20-year annualized cost for a new plant is roughly:

Combined-Cycle Gas (CC): $184,198 per MW-year

Combustion Turbine Gas (CT): $185,198 per MW-year

Coal Steam Plant (CP): $742,650 per MW-year

That means a new 1 MW gas plant needs about $184,000 per year to cover fixed costs, while a comparable coal unit would need $743,000 per year – four times as much. The proposed First Energy gas plant has a capacity of 1,200 MW. The math: 1200 MW (plant capacity) X $559,000 (delta in CP vs CC) = $671 million more for a new coal plant compared to a natural gas plant.

Those costs flow straight to ratepayers.

Key Question: Would you rather pay $671 million a year more in order to use coal instead of gas at a single plant? Of course not. You only care that the lights come on when you flip the switch.

Market Reality

At typical capacity factors (gas CC 78%, new coal 25%), PJM estimates the LCOE for a new combined-cycle gas plant around $46/MWh, compared with $378/MWh for a new coal unit.

PJM’s average wholesale energy price in 2024 was only $33–34/MWh. A coal plant that needs $378/MWh to break even has no chance of recovering its costs. A gas plant at $46/MWh is at least in the ballpark – and can supplement revenue with capacity and ancillary-service payments.

That’s why no rational investor builds coal anymore. The last new coal-fired power plant in the United States came online in 2013 – in Texas.

What the Market Is Telling Us

PJM’s generation mix makes the point clearer. In 2024, natural gas produced 44.3% of PJM’s electricity – the highest share ever – while coal fell to 14.5%, its lowest on record. In 2008, those numbers were reversed: coal 55%, gas 7%.

Coal generation barely rose 1.4% last year; gas rose 3.5%. PJM’s monitor identified 34.7 GW of capacity at risk of retirement by 2030 – most of it coal, with 13.3 GW expected to retire strictly for economic reasons.

The trend isn’t ideology. It’s arithmetic.

Politics vs. Economics

Lawmakers clinging to the past will talk about jobs, blame renewables (whose share remains small), invoke China, or slap the “liberal” label on anyone citing numbers. But markets don’t care about slogans. They don’t care about picking one commodity over another for arbitrary reasons. They respond to cost, efficiency, and return on investment.

Reality? This is business, not politics. It’s economics, not ideology.

If the so-called “Make Electricity More Expensive Act” passes, that new First Energy gas plant could be forced to sit idle so older, less efficient coal units can run instead.

Who pays for that distortion – the higher costs of running the less efficient plant?

Not PJM. Not the utilities. You do. Are you ok with that?",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/metronews-plug.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 21:01:12.798141

This week Australia is hosting 13 leading US clean tech manufacturing companies to showcase the immense opportunities in investing in Australian projects.

The Australia-America Clean Industry Delegation reinforces the Albanese Government's commitment to becoming a global hub for clean energy generation and manufacturing, following the Prime Minister's visit to New York earlier this year.

Australia has a wealth of natural resources, a highly skilled workforce, and a clear government agenda, highlighted by our emissions reduction sector plans, to position the nation as a premier destination for global investment. To support these discussions today the Albanese Government is releasing the Investment Blueprint, to accompany Australia's 2035 target.

The Investment Blueprint responds to growing calls internationally that climate targets be investable, and that nations set out plans to provide greater certainty for investors. The Blueprint emphasises Australia's position as an attractive and stable investment destination, as our 2035 target and six sector plans lay the groundwork for long-term investment decision making.

This foreign investment will help Australia reach our economic potential by providing capital to finance new industries and enhance existing industries, boosting infrastructure and productivity and creating employment opportunities in our regions.

Over three days, the Australia-America Clean Industry Delegation will meet with senior ministers, government finance bodies, and private investors to explore clean energy opportunities in Australia.

The program includes high-level forums - including a Future Made in Australia Investor Forum - policy briefings, targeted workshops, and one-on-one meetings to accelerate investment and collaboration. It concludes with a visit to Newcastle, offering delegates a first-hand look at Australia's renewable technology manufacturing in action and the potential for investment in Australia's regions.

The $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia agenda makes clear our commitment to a clean energy and advanced manufacturing future. Crowding in private sector and international investment is critical to achieving Australia's climate, energy and industrial goals.

These partnerships will drive job creation and skill development in Australia's outer suburbs and regions, while delivering the renewable infrastructure needed to position Australia as the first choice for clean energy investment.

This growing recognition that climate and biodiversity crises are interlinked could make climate finance more effective, directing funds to ecosystem restoration, agroforestry, and community-led conservation.","A decade has passed since the member countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted the Paris Agreement — a milestone global pact that committed them to keeping the world’s average surface temperature from rising well under 2ºC and striving to limit it to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels.

However, climate finance has lagged, global emissions continue to rise, and the gap between pledges and practice has only widened since.

Against the backdrop of record-breaking heat, intensifying climate consequences, and a mounting public frustration with global inaction, the 30th Conference of Parties (COP30) of the UNFCCC begins at Belém in Brazil today.

It is both symbolic and strategic that COP30 is being hosted in Belém, which is a point of entry to the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon is one of the world’s largest and most important carbon sinks (estimated at 150-200 billion tonnes) and biodiversity reserves on the planet — and it is threatened by deforestation and land conversion to non-forest use. As a result, it is tipping towards irreversible decline.

Equity and inclusion are central to climate negotiations. But paradoxically, even before the negotiations began, COP30 faced an unexpected test: inclusion. This is because Belém has limited logistical options, leaving hotel room rates to skyrocket and rendering it difficult for representatives from low-income nations and civil society organisations to participate. Such logistical exclusions have, in some ways, undercut the moral weight of the process.

‘Implementation COP’

For starters, COP30 is being called the ‘Implementation COP’ because it is expected to be a watershed event where commitments are expected to be translated into concrete action. Guided by the Global Stocktake (GST) — which is a mandatory review that countries have to undertake every five years to assess their progress on addressing climate change, identify gaps, and draft plans — COP30 is expected to advance mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation.

Its programme will thus focus on six key areas, including energy, industry, and transport transitions; stewardship of forests, oceans, and biodiversity; transformation of food systems; resilience in cities, infrastructure, and water; and human and social development.

The Baku-to-Belém Roadmap on Climate Finance is a plan led by the COP presidency, developed by Azerbaijan and Brazil under the UNFCCC’s guidance, to show how countries and institutions could scale finance for developing nations to at least $1.3 trillion a year by 2035. It’s less a binding pledge and more a menu of actions to inform negotiations after the $300-billion New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) decision at COP29. Now, as the first major stocktake after the Roadmap, participants are looking at COP30 to set a new collective goal for 2035. In addition to revisiting emission reduction and climate finance goals, it’s also expected to reaffirm the fact that protecting forests and indigenous communities is central to global climate resilience.

Ultimately, COP30 will seek to mobilise all actors to accelerate climate action.

Adaptation in negotiations

Climate adaptation is imperative for the survival of millions of people in the Global South. But because adaptation is context-specific, what works in a coastal delta is unlikely to work in a mountain village. As a result, negotiations surrounding the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) have been difficult. The GGA aims to establish quantifiable goals and metrics for resilience, organise funding that matches the need, and create a system for accounting and quantifying adaptation outcomes. This long-delayed framework is expected to be established at COP30.

As discussions progress, experts around the world emphasise the need to consider local and indigenous knowledge systems in this process. Across India, for example, traditional seed varieties, water-harvesting structures, and community-based ecosystem restoration efforts offer proven models of resilience.

Finance: the missing piece

Under the Paris Agreement, economically developed countries pledged $100 billion per year to finance climate action in developing nations. At COP29, a breakthrough agreement called the NCQG on Climate Finance was reached. This target is expected to triple climate finance from $100 billion to $300 billion annually by 2035 and scale up finance from all actors, both public and private, to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.

However, it should be noted that the $300 billion is significantly less than the estimated trillions of dollars needed by economically developing countries, with the latter arguing that the use of ‘all actors’ to scale up finance has diluted the common but differentiated responsibilities principle, which also includes historical emissions. ‘All actors’ means every potential source of climate finance, not just developed-country governments. It lumps together public treasuries, multilateral development banks, private investors, philanthropies, sub-national authorities, and even developing countries’ own private sectors.

The Loss and Damage Fund, set up in COP28, is also grossly underfunded, receiving less than a billion dollars against an annual need running into hundreds of billions of dollars. For developing countries, this finance is an enabler of ambition, enhancing preparedness for extreme climate events, expanding climate-resilient agriculture, and accelerating the adoption of renewable energy.

COP30 is expected to finalise the reporting requirements and financing arrangements under the NCQG. One looming question at Belém is: will a credible pathway emerge for moving from the $300 billion to the $1.3 trillion target and build confidence in developing countries? And will Belém also finalise the modalities of finance: who will pay, who will gain, and how it will be accounted for?

Transition and ambition

Transitions must be fair as economies move towards net zero (i.e. that humans add no net greenhouse gases to the atmosphere over a period; emissions are reduced almost to zero, and any residual sources are balanced by removals, e.g. restoring forests and carbon capture) — and transformation can’t be fuelled solely by finance. Access to reasonably priced technology and capacity building are equally important for many developing countries, be it efficient water systems, resilient crops, or clean energy, which are frequently hindered by high costs or intellectual property issues.

Beyond promises, COP30 should lead to North-South collaborations for training, innovation, and technology sharing. Otherwise, climate transition runs the risk of becoming yet another area of inequality. In countries like India, investments in low-carbon manufacturing, renewable energy, ecosystem restoration, green skills development, small businesses, and alternative livelihoods must all be part of a ‘just transition’.

Countries were expected to update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) through 2035 and submit them by February 2025. However, according to Climate Action Tracker, many countries are yet to submit their reports. The ones submitted so far account for only 19% of global emissions.

Negotiations at COP30 are expected to address the insufficient ambition of climate targets and reveal whether countries are prepared to put aside rhetoric and match science and ambition, a significant challenge in the absence of climate finance.

Climate-nature nexus

A key spotlight of Belém is the long-overdue integration of climate and biodiversity agendas. Brazil is pushing for an innovative financing model for conservation, known as the ‘Tropical Forest Forever Facility’. The proposal aims to compensate more than 70 developing countries with tropical forests for their efforts to preserve them.

This growing recognition that climate and biodiversity crises are interlinked could make climate finance more effective, directing funds to ecosystem restoration, agroforestry, and community-led conservation.

India at COP30

At Belém, India will be championing climate justice and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, urging developed nations to take the lead in emission cuts and financial support. In fact, at the mid-year climate talks in Bonn, India played a pivotal role in coordinating the G77+China bloc of developing countries to advocate for a fair and predictable finance goal under the NCQG framework.

This positioning reinforces India’s role as both a responsible power and a representative of broader southern concerns while serving as a bridge between the Global North and South.

However, while India’s domestic targets are ambitious, efforts in the institutional landscape remain a work in progress, as reflected in initiatives such as green budgeting, sovereign green bonds, and the proposed national carbon market expected by 2026. This gap must be viewed in the context of India’s developmental realities, which continue to shape its climate choices and actions.

The stakes could not be higher at COP30. The Amazon setting underscores the urgency of protecting the world’s ecosystems while tackling emissions. For India, it is a moment to shape the conversation, striking a balance between domestic imperatives and global responsibilities. What unfolds in Belém will go a long way towards determining whether the international community can still bend the curve of emissions and whether emerging economies, such as India, can secure the space and support they need for economic growth that is resilient to climate change.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/mqge4v/article70259125.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/COP30_Climate_Summit_91947.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 21:01:16.522356

The global shift to a low-carbon economy is accelerating, changing how growth happens and where capital flows. To stay competitive, Canada must catalyse investment across clean and conventional sectors so our industries can meet the world's rising demand for low-carbon products and energy. In the face of global uncertainty, Canada's new government is focused on what we can control. How we respond to the challenge of climate disruptions will influence Canada's economic competitiveness, drive new investment opportunities and shape our global standing for generations to come. Canada must take action to fight climate change, drive down emissions and invest in building the economy of the future.

Today, the Honourable Lena Metlege Diab, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, echoed the announcement highlighting Canada's Climate Competitiveness Strategy--a strategy based on driving investment and achieving results. Building on Canada's competitive advantages and global standing as a clean energy superpower, the strategy will strengthen our economy by:

strengthening industrial carbon pricing

providing clarity on regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

boosting clean economy investment through tax credits

supporting critical minerals projects

mobilising capital for the transition to net-zero

developing new metrics to track our success.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy will help Canada build the strongest economy in the G7. With this strategy, we can leverage Canada's unique strengths--like our abundant natural resources and innovation in clean technology--to attract investment, create good jobs in communities across the country, and ensure Canada continues to be competitive on the world stage. Every step we take to build infrastructure, train workers, and support innovation in this is an investment in Canada's long-term prosperity.

The strategy will create the conditions to propel Canada's competitive advantage through investments in clean growth technologies. By investing in innovation and scaling homegrown solutions, we will position Canadian companies to lead. We will leverage Canadian clean technology to reduce the emissions intensity of the energy we generate, and the products and resources we produce. This will both address climate change and open more economic opportunities internationally.

Canada has the assets to lead and seize the tremendous opportunities of the historic transformation towards low-carbon energy, growing jobs and improving affordability across the economy.

Canada's Climate Competitiveness Strategy will help build Canada Strong by establishing a competitive advantage that will set us on track toward a more resilient economic and environmental future.

Quick facts

Canada's economy is now 34% less carbon-intensive than it was in 2005 thanks to energy efficiency improvements, decarbonisation of the electricity grid, and structural shifts in the economy.

Canada has decoupled economic growth from emissions. From 2005 to 2023, Canada's greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 8.5%, while gross domestic product grew by 38%.

In 2024, global investments in clean energy reached over $2.8 trillion--nearly double the level of investment in fossil fuels--and the global clean technology market is expected to triple by 2035.

Climate change is a growing threat to Canada and the world. We are already seeing the risks and costs of climate change through extreme weather events like the wildfires burning throughout Canada this summer as well as drought, floods and more severe storms.

Over the last decade, the average yearly cost of weather-related disasters and catastrophic losses has risen to the equivalent of 5-6% of Canada's annual GDP growth. 2024 was the most destructive season in Canadian history for insured losses from severe weather. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says extreme weather events caused $9.2 billion in insured losses.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy provides a chance to retool and reinvest in building Canada strong and sustainable, working closely with provinces, territories and Indigenous partners by focusing on shared economic and climate goals.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy complements and does not replace the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan and other actions we will continue to take under the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act.

The strategy outlines whole-of-government action to mobilise public and private sector capital. This includes finalising investment tax credits, launching sustainable investment guidelines, and continuing to offer Carbon Contracts for Difference through the Canada Growth Fund to de-risk investments.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy aligns with and advances the work on accelerating major nation-building projects, to enable clean growth, address climate change, and strengthen Canada's industries.

There is a photograph, taken ten years ago in Paris, that today seems like something of a relic.

In it, dozens of men and women line up in dark suits, in front of an enormous sign that reads COP21 Paris.

Right in the middle the UK's then-Prime Minister, David Cameron, grins widely, as he stands beside the future King Charles III, just in front of China’s Xi Jinping. Far off to the right is the then US President Barack Obama, deep in conversation with someone who is cut off from the frame - because there were so many leaders lining up that day that it was difficult for the photographer to capture them all at once.

What a far cry from the family photograph taken on Thursday with this year's line-up at the COP30 summit in Brazil, with just 30 leaders in the picture.

Xi and Modi were no-shows, along with the leaders of around 160 other countries. And notably absent was the US President Donald Trump.

In fact, the Trump administration has exited the process entirely and has said it will not send any high-level officials this year.

Which raises the question, why have a two-week-long multinational gathering at all if so many leaders aren’t there?

Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN's climate process under whose leadership the Paris Agreement was struck, said during last year's gathering that the COP process was ""not fit for purpose.""

""The golden era for multilateral diplomacy is over,"" agrees Joss Garman, a former climate activist who now heads a new think tank called Loom.

""Climate politics is now more than ever about who captures and controls the economic benefits of new energy industries,"" he tells me.

So, with carbon dioxide emissions still rising even after 29 of these meetings - which are, after all, aimed at bringing them down - will more COPs make any difference?

Trump and the climate 'con job'

On his first day back in office, Trump used his trademark marker pen to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, the 2015 UN treaty under which nations agreed to work together to try to keep global warming below 1.5°C.

""This 'climate change' - it's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,"" he told the UN General Assembly in September. ""If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.""

He has rolled back restrictions on oil, gas, and coal, signed billions of dollars of tax breaks for fossil fuel firms, and opened up federal lands for extraction.

Plus Trump and his team have called on governments around the world to abandon their ""pathetic"" renewable energy programmes and buy US oil and gas - in some cases with the risk of punitive tariffs if they don't. Japan and South Korea as well as Europe have agreed to buy tens of billions of US hydrocarbons.

The objective is clear: Trump says he wants to make the US the ""number one energy superpower in the world"".

Meanwhile, he has set about dismantling his predecessor Joe Biden's clean energy agenda.

Subsidies and tax breaks for wind and solar have been slashed, permits withdrawn, projects cancelled. Research funding has been cut too.

""Wind power in the United States has been subsidised for 33 years - isn't that enough?"" US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said when I asked him to explain the administration's policy when we met in September. ""You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies.""

John Podesta, a senior adviser on climate to both Obama and Biden, sees it differently. ""The United States is taking a wrecking ball to clean energy,"" he argues.

“They're trying to take us back not to the 20th Century, but the 19th.""

Last month, a landmark deal that would have cut global shipping emissions was abandoned after the US, along with Saudi Arabia, succeeded in ending the talks.

Many supporters of the COP talks are concerned. What happens if the US path leads to other countries dialling down their commitments?

Anna Aberg, a Research Fellow in Chatham House's Environment and Society Centre, describes COP as ""taking place in a really difficult political context"" given Trump's position.

""I think it's more important than ever that this COP sends some kind of signal to the world that there are still governments and businesses and institutions that are acting on climate change.”

It’s too late to win at table tennis

Trump's strategy puts the US on a collision course with China, which has also been working for decades to dominate the world's energy supplies - but through clean technology.

In 2023, clean technologies drove roughly 40% of China's economic growth, according to the climate website Carbon Brief. After a slight slowdown last year, renewables accounted for a quarter of all new growth and now make up more than 10% of the entire economy.

And, like Trump's America, China is engaging internationally well beyond participation in COP - it is taking its entire energy model global.

The split has transformed the climate debate. It is now one that pits the world's two superpowers against each other for control of the most essential industry on Earth.

And it leaves the UK and Europe - as well as major emerging powers like India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil - caught in the middle.

Speaking at this year‘s conference, a source in government at a major developed country said: “Of all the things they're most terrified of, the biggest is being seen to criticise Trump.”

The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned last month that Europe must not repeat what she termed the mistakes of the past and lose another strategic industry to China.

She called the loss of Europe's solar manufacturing base to cheaper Chinese rivals ""a cautionary tale we must not forget"".

The European Commission has forecasted that the market for renewables and other clean energy sources will grow from €600bn (£528bn) to €2 trillion (£1.74tn) within a decade and wants Europe to capture at least 15% of that.

But that ambition may come too late.

""China is already the world's clean-tech superpower,"" says Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Policy Institute. Its dominance in solar, wind, EVs, and advanced battery technologies, he says, is now ""virtually unassailable”.

He likens it to trying to beat the Chinese national team at table tennis: ""If you want to surpass China, you had to get your act together 25 years ago. If you want to do it now, you have no hope.""

China produces over 80% of the world's solar panels, a similar share of advanced batteries, 70% of EVs, and more than 60% of wind turbines - all at phenomenally low prices.

The EU's recent move to raise tariffs on Chinese EVs reflects the scale of the dilemma. Open the market and Europe's car industry could collapse; close it and green targets may not be met.

Restricting Chinese access to these markets may slow emissions reductions, says Joss Garman, but he argues, ""If we ignore questions about economic security, jobs, national security, that risks undermining public and political support for the entire climate effort.""

COP: New purpose or pointless?

Now, with these shifts in direction of global politics and priorities, Anna Aberg says she expects COP to become an annual forum for ""holding to account"" countries and other organisations, something she believes remains an ""important role”.

The gathering in Brazil follows the acknowledgement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the 1.5°C target set in Paris will be breached - this, he has said, represents ""deadly negligence"" on the part of the world community.

Last year was the hottest ever recorded, and 60 leading climate scientists said in June that the Earth could breach 1.5°C in as little as three years at current levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet more people are questioning the need for an annual gathering.

""I think we need one big COP every five years. And between that, I'm not sure what COP is for,"" says Michael Liebreich, founder of energy consultancy Bloomberg New Energy Finance and host of a green energy podcast, Cleaning Up.

""You can't just expect politicians to go and make more and more commitments. You need time for industries to develop and for things to happen. You need the real economy to catch up.""

He believes it would be much more productive for the discussions to happen in smaller meetings focused on removing barriers to clean energy.

But he also believes that some issues, like implementation, need to be discussed in places he deems more relevant - like on Wall Street ""where people can actually fund stuff” - as opposed to on the edge of the Brazilian rainforest.

Even so, this will be important negotiations at this year's COP. Among other things, it aims to get an agreement for a multi-billion-dollar fund to support the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.

The UK's Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband believes these meetings have delivered real progress by getting countries to engage with tackling climate change and enact policies that have made the renewable revolution possible.

""It's dry, it's complicated, it's anguished, it's tiring,” he says - “and it's absolutely necessary”.

Many now do, however, accept there is a strong argument for these international gatherings to be scaled down.

Ultimately, however, the real choice underlying it, for so many nations in attendance, simply comes down to the extent to which they align with a China-led clean energy revolution - or double down on the fossil fuels–first agenda.

Which is why many observers say the process of decarbonisation is going to be less about the multi-country commitments of COPs past, and far more about big-money deals between individual countries as we look ahead to this year’s summit - and how COPs may well play out in the future.

It is a is a clean energy hub.
Hogan said that while those emissions caps were removed, there would continue to be an industrial price on carbon emissions.
It’ll be important to invest in carbon capture and sequestration if we’re not going to proceed with that cap on oil and gas emissions.
“Does this mean oil and gas emissions will go up.","Calgary’s energy producing firms got some good news from the Government of Canada’s Budget 2025 during an event at UCalgary on Nov. 9.

Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience Elanor Olszewski, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Corey Hogan outlined how the government’s budget would put an end to emissions caps, provide increased clarity on industrial greenhouse gas emissions, and provide tax credits for the clean economy.

“With this plan, we’re strengthening carbon pricing as well as methane regulations, and those really are the most effective tools we have at this point in time to cut emissions while keeping Canadian industry competitive, and by that we mean on the world stage,” said Minister Olszewski.

“I think these new budgetary measures will ensure that Calgary continues to lead the way in building Canada’s clean energy future.”

She said that would come with partnerships with the provinces, local governments, and Indigenous groups.

“The Prime Minister and my cabinet colleagues are working with Alberta officials on transformative projects like Pathways, which will really position us as a global energy leader in the future. We are also trying to create certainty for investors, predictability, better market access for Alberta’s world class experts, so that we can ensure that clean growth means good jobs and shared prosperity,” said Minister Olszewski.

Hogan said the introduction of new incentive tax credits (ITCs) would build on the investments that have already been made by the Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund into clean tech hubs within Calgary.

“The entire purpose of the ITCs is to generate the kind of capital and innovation that we know is going to be needed to make Canada that global leader that we’re talking about. We know that Calgary is not just a conventional energy hub. It is a is a clean energy hub. It is an energy hub full stop, and it’s part of why we lead the world across the entire spectrum of energy technologies,” he said.

Investment in clean tech were essential because other nations are also competing in that space, said Hogan.

“We’re seeing capital is moving into that space very aggressively. You’re seeing the clean technologies get the investments over the conventional technologies—both significant drivers of investment, both important, but this is where the world is going, and we need to secure both,” he said.

“But we’re not the only ones who realize this. Nations around the world are racing to build clean industries that will power the future in energy, manufacturing, critical minerals and technology. The clean technology market is set to triple by 2035. This transformation is reshaping trade.”

Budget 2025 supported by Chamber, major local firms

In a statement sent by the Calgary Chamber of Commerce on Budget 2025, they said that moves by the federal government to remove an emissions cap was something they were pleased with.

Hogan said that while those emissions caps were removed, there would continue to be an industrial price on carbon emissions.

“It will be important to to reduce our methane emissions. It’ll be important to invest in carbon capture and sequestration if we’re not going to proceed with that cap on oil and gas emissions. But the good news is, those are things that we’ve all said that we want to do. That’s things that provincial government said we want to do. That’s things that industry said that they want to do,” he said.

“So it suddenly becomes a question of let’s just make sure that we’re all have the same understanding, the same comprehension as to what that means. We’re not going to get to a situation where that means one thing to one thing to one party, one to the other.”

Minister Olszewski said collaboration would be the key to moving Canada’s and Calgary’s economy forward.

“The fact that the federal government is working together with premiers, with other business leaders, with other groups, to make sure that what we do reflects a consensus between those parties. I just think that’s fundamentally important,” she said.

Hogan said one of the rationales for removing the emissions cap was that the planet doesn’t really care where the emissions come from it was just important to reduce them—and that meant ensuring that the market could find solutions to that problem.

“Does this mean oil and gas emissions will go up. I don’t know? What we’ve seen is that oil and gas, of course, has managed to reduce emissions intensity over time. We’ve also seen that Canadian oil and gas, which is produced in an environmentally sensitive, socially sensitive way, has found markets across the world,” he said.

“If the market decides that ultimately you can reduce emissions elsewhere in Canada, and Canadians are better off with the emissions from oil and gas being lower in the order, that’s great. I don’t think any of us should have a problem with that, because our concern should be how do we reduce emissions? Not where do those reductions come from.”",https://i0.wp.com/livewirecalgary.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251109-Budget-2025-Announcement-AT-0029-copy.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-09 19:58:35.000898

And they are so far getting these higher fees in new contracts.","Europe’s rush to shake off Russian gas dependence and Asia’s push to buy higher volumes of American energy while negotiating trade deals have created a booming export deal market for U.S. LNG exporters and developers, even at increased liquefaction fees.

Year to date, American LNG developers have signed sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) for existing and future export plants for a total of 29.5 million metric tons per year, according to data from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group cited by Reuters.

The volume of newly contracted U.S. LNG more than quadrupled between January and October compared to the 7 million metric tons per year (mtpa) contracted for the whole of 2024.

The U.S. LNG industry is now on track to have signed the second-highest export volumes on record, trailing only 2022, when buyers in Europe turned en masse to American gas as Russian pipeline supply to Europe slumped and stopped for many EU markets, including Germany.

Encouraged by the Trump Administration’s energy policy, LNG developers are taking advantage of the market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

So far this year, Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. In July, Venture Global took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG, together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. Top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project. NextDecade has decided to invest $6.7 billion in the expansion of its Rio Grande LNG facility in Texas, in the second Rio Grande expansion announced this year, while Sempra approved a $14 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion.

U.S. developers of six export projects have made FIDs and secured financing so far this year, bringing total global LNG finance to a record of $72 billion, energy commodity shipping broker and advisor Poten & Partners said last month.

“Six US FIDs in one year is unprecedented– the highest number before this year was three US projects. The liquefaction finance tally could continue to climb in the final quarter of this year as a few more projects – also in the US – appear to be nearing FID,” Poten & Partners said.

In the near term, the U.S. is set to add 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in LNG export capacity in 2025 and 2026 alone, as Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects come online, the Energy Information Administration said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook in October. Additions to LNG export capacity are set to boost total U.S. LNG exports to 14.7 Bcf/d in 2025 and to 16.3 Bcf/d in 2026, up from 11.9 Bcf/d in 2024, according to the EIA estimates.

The surge in U.S. LNG exports and the expected jump in Qatari LNG shipments once Qatar’s mega expansion projects are completed in 2027 have stoked fears of a coming LNG glut that could depress prices.

U.S. developers appear unfazed by this prospect and are even raising their liquefaction fees as project costs soar amid persistent higher financing rates, labor shortages, and an increase in prices of materials.

In March this year, most U.S. liquefaction fees were being discussed at $2.65 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) to $2.95 per MMBtu, “as EPC cost escalations show no sign of abating,” Poten & Partners said at the time.

“Higher raw material prices, which are seeing further escalation because of tariffs, coupled with rising labor and financing costs are having a pronounced impact on US LNG liquefaction project implementation. The cost increases make it challenging for developers to keep engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts valid as they try to move ahead with their LNG export projects,” the broker and advisor said.

Now U.S. LNG exporters and developers are asking about 15% higher liquefaction fees compared to the 2023 average of about $2 per MMBtu, Poten & Partners business intelligence head Jason Feer told Reuters this week.

And they are so far getting these higher fees in new contracts. Buyers are still willing to pay higher liquefaction fees to secure American LNG, which is seen in Europe as a means to cut off Russian supply by 2027 and in Asia as a lever to pull in tariff and trade deal talks with the Trump Administration.

Qcells, a unit of South Korea's Hanwha Solutions, said Friday that it will also lay off 300 workers from staffing agencies at its plants in Dalton and Cartersville, both northwest of Atlanta.

The company says U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been detaining imported components at ports on suspicion that they contain materials that may have been made with forced labor in China, meaning it can't run its solar panel assembly lines at full strength.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced in August that her department was stepping up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a 2021 law that restricts Chinese goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S. Published reports indicate that U.S. officials began detaining solar cells made by Qcells in June. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection couldn't immediately answer questions about Qcells on Friday.

Qcells says none of its materials or components are made with forced labor or even come from China. Spokesperson Marta Stoepker said the company maintains “robust supply chain due diligence measures” and “very detailed documentation,” which has been successful in getting some shipments released.

“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said.

She said Qcells is continuing to cooperate and expects to resume full production in the coming weeks and months.

“Although our supply chain operations are beginning to normalize, today we shared with our employees that HR actions must be taken to improve operational efficiency until production capacity returns to normal levels,"" Stoepker said in a statement.

Qcells has said it pays workers an average of about $53,000 a year. Workers will retain full benefits during furloughs.

Qcells is completing a $2.3 billion plant in Cartersville to make ingots, wafers and solar cells — the building blocks of finished solar modules. The company has said it will finish the plant even though President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress dismantled most of the tax credits for buying solar panels earlier this year.

That does not align with the United States regulations and has complicated a vast amount of long-term deals in the pipeline.

Europe’s gas sector is facing a new horizon that will enable better energy security","An essential component for the energy sector is to efficiently track the methane emissions from the energy industry, and the EU has some of the strictest rules and regulations for any imports of gas into the region. However, while we commend the regulations aimed at reducing harmful emissions, the United States and other nations have lamented the EU’s emission regulations, noting that it has complicated the trade of essential energy resources. With several market insiders urging the EU to reconsider its emission regulations, the sector is facing a troubling time in Europe.

European buyers and US suppliers are in agreement over the EU’s strict rules

The overarching consensus among the litany of European buyers and the myriad of US gas suppliers is that the EU’s emission regulations for methane have become too strict and are placing complications on the trade of gas and LNG.

With a Swiss energy trader, Axpo, noting that it was in advanced negotiations with a US supplier of gas, but that the deal has been put on hold for the time being, as the US supplier simply can not meet the EU’s emission regulations.

The EU’s regulations for methane emissions require EU importers to report information about the methane emissions of imported gas. That does not align with the United States regulations and has complicated a vast amount of long-term deals in the pipeline. The EU’s regulation requires the information to be submitted no later than May 2029 and cover imports from supply contracts concluded or renewed after 4 August 2024.

“Signing supply deals of that scale without knowing whether they will comply with the EU regulation is a big risk.” – Axpo head of trading Domenico de Luca

Both the United States and Qatar are urging the EU to amend its methane regulations

The United States is the largest producer of gas energy in the world, and the US gas sector is urging the EU to rethink its methane regulations for imports. Noting that the current regulations complicate things, as buyers can not commit to long-term contracts, and suppliers in the United States can not meet the stringent emission regulations laid out by the EU.

“We are in a difficult situation. Europe has few options if it doesn’t want to go back to Russian LNG.” – Axpo head of trading Domenico de Luca

The new wave of sanctions imposed on Russian energy in all its forms has further complicated the situation, as the world prepares for a future without Russian energy resources. The EU’s tight restrictions on methane emissions are a step in the right direction, but may need some easing of regulations while the world conemplates the future of the international energy market.

The result of the sanction has led to tighter prices for diesel and jet fuel as well, pointing to the fact that the sanction may have far-reaching implications that were not carefully considered by the international energy sector. Qatar has also released a joint statement with the US, urging the EU to rethink its emission regulations.

A modern industry policy must do better.
In this context, the national resilience pivot is not just an economic issue but a strategic one.
This means applying clear, transparent metrics for sovereignty dividends, which are the quantifiable returns in resilience, capability and regional value creation.
For too long, Australian industry policy has oscillated between two extremes: uncritical market faith and over-engineered state intervention.","Australia stands at a crossroads where ambition, fiscal restraint and strategic necessity intersect. The Future Made in Australia agenda, once a rallying cry for sovereign capability and clean-energy transformation, is now the test case for whether we can build genuine national resilience without repeating the waste and distortion of past subsidy cycles. To succeed, Canberra must shift its focus from chasing announcements to engineering durable capability.

The 2026–27 federal budget will be the crucible for this test. Globally, industry policy spending has exploded: the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act has already mobilised US$369 billion (about $567 billion) in tax credits across power, industry and transport, while the European Union’s 025 Clean Industrial Deal and new state-aid rules give members wider levers to back clean-tech manufacturing, rather than a fixed euro envelope. Closer to home, Japan and Korea have each earmarked more than US$200 billion (about $300 billion) for semiconductor and battery competitiveness. Against that tide, Australia’s Future Made in Australia fund, at roughly $22 billion over a decade, looks modest. Yet here, every dollar must work harder because ‘value for money’ is being redefined to mean not just fiscal prudence but sovereignty gained per taxpayer dollar spent.

Industry policy is back, but the stakes and the terrain have changed. Manufacturing’s share of Australian GDP has declined from between 13 and 14 percent in 1990 to between 5 and 6 percent today, and the nation imports around 90 percent of its refined critical minerals and battery components. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency projects global demand for lithium and rare earths will grow sixfold by 2040, magnifying both opportunity and exposure. Australia cannot match the fiscal firepower of the US or China, but it can outthink them by designing policies that leverage its comparative advantages, geographic proximity to the Indo-Pacific, and trust capital among partners seeking secure and transparent supply chains.

That requires discipline and design, not desperation. The risk today is that Future Made in Australia will become an open chequebook, a patchwork of subsidies responding to the loudest corporate voices or the most politically convenient regions. The nation’s history is littered with the remains of such ‘innovation led’ interventions: from 2008 to 2018, annual assistance typically ran in the low-to-mid-teens of billions, yet few sectors became globally competitive. A modern industry policy must do better. It must reward endurance, not entry.

That begins with redefining what sovereignty looks like in the 2020s. Resilience is not about producing everything at home; it is about ensuring that what we do make and process adds strategic weight and withstands global shocks. For Australia, that means prioritising capabilities that convert raw advantage into national strength, critical minerals, green-energy systems, defence manufacturing and logistics infrastructure in northern Australia. The north already generates more than $45 billion in exports annually, yet less than 15 percent of its output is value-added domestically. Every additional processing step captured onshore compounds economic resilience and regional employment multipliers, particularly in Darwin, Townsville and Karratha, where defence spending represents a sizeable chunk of local GDP.

In this context, the national resilience pivot is not just an economic issue but a strategic one. Building midstream capability in rare earths and battery materials, for instance, is about more than jobs or exports; it’s about denying coercive leverage to others and ensuring allied forces can source, sustain, and scale in crisis. A network of northern-based processing hubs, connected by modern transport corridors and renewable energy zones, would embed resilience into both supply chains and deterrence posture. However, such investments require coordination among federal, state and private capital.

Here lies the second fault line: governance. If Future Made in Australia is to succeed, it must evolve beyond a brand into a disciplined investment framework. This means applying clear, transparent metrics for sovereignty dividends, which are the quantifiable returns in resilience, capability and regional value creation. It also requires independent oversight to prevent subsidy capture, where well-connected firms monopolise incentives while delivering little enduring capacity. Without such guardrails, the program risks devolving into a fiscal black hole under the banner of national security.

A credible industry strategy must also align alliance economics with national benefit. Foreign investment remains critical, as partners such as Japan, Korea and the US collectively account for more than 60 percent of Australia’s critical minerals offtake. But Canberra must ensure these projects lock in Australian participation across the value chain. Co-processing, joint certification, and shared research and development can create mutual benefit while maintaining domestic skill and asset retention.

The final test is cultural. For too long, Australian industry policy has oscillated between two extremes: uncritical market faith and over-engineered state intervention. The Future Made in Australia agenda must chart a third path: strategic capitalism, where the government acts as an enabler and investor, not as an operator or benefactor. That requires reshaping bureaucratic culture from one of program delivery to one of enterprise building. Economists from Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade must think like investors; Defence and industry must think like systems integrators; and northern stakeholders must be treated not as grant recipients, but as partners in the national project.

Australia’s resilience won’t be measured in policy papers or budget headlines, but in whether our ports, refineries, and supply chains can continue to operate when the next geopolitical shock strikes. Every dollar spent under Future Made in Australia must move the dial toward that outcome: greater autonomy, deeper partnerships and longer-term economic endurance.

If we get this right, Australia can position itself as the Indo-Pacific’s trusted producer, a nation that builds, refines and exports value with integrity and foresight. But if we fall into the trap of subsidy theatre, we risk eroding both fiscal credibility and strategic momentum. The choice, as ever, lies not in ambition but in execution. The Future Made in Australia agenda must evolve, fast, from stimulus to strategy, from politics to policy and from announcements to action.",https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/51401491902_b07659f8c7_k.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 17:58:23.673545

The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.
According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions.
Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory.","The tanker and oil markets are expected to face a different landscape, as a result of the latest policy choices by the US presidency. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “Trump’s second presidency started with a strong push to change US environmental policy. Right at the start, the president put in motion the plan to re-exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which established a framework to encourage domestic energy production and weaken the electric vehicle (EV) mandate. In the months that followed, federal lands and offshore areas previously off-limits to drilling were reopened for leasing, and several LNG export projects were reapproved. The Interior Department cleared new exploration in Alaska’s Arctic zones, while the Bureau of Land Management simplified environmental reviews for oil and gas projects in the western states. Still, several of these actions are facing ongoing legal challenges from environmental groups, and whilst headlines show US crude production reaching record levels this year, the bigger picture is that growth in output is slowing, with production expected to remain largely flat year-on-year in 2026. Companies remain cautious about spending on the back of lower oil prices and expectations of rising oversupply. The oil rig count declined in August to its lowest level in nearly four years, although a modest uptick has been seen since then. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.

According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to roll back rules finalised in 2024 that require carmakers to sell more electric or low-emission cars from model year 2027 onward, with the process well underway. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has begun relaxing fuel efficiency targets. Separately, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” reduced or cancelled several clean-energy incentives introduced under Biden’s “Inflation Reduction Act.” In particular, tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs are no longer available after September 30. While the reversal of these policies is being legally challenged on many fronts, the industry response is already visible. Several automakers have slowed their EV rollout plans. For example, General Motors, the largest US carmaker, recently acknowledged it is scaling back its EV ambitions by slowing production at EV plants and shifting investment toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles in response to the changing regulatory framework and weaker demand”.

“Changes to EV targets are expected to slow the decline in US oil demand. Ernst & Young now expects EVs to account for half of new US car sales by 2038, five years later than initially projected. The decline in US refining runs will also be shallower than previously envisaged, which will have implications for tanker trade. It will reduce US crude export potential, with more barrels retained domestically. At the same time, this will also add an element of support to US crude imports, mainly sourced from the Atlantic Basin. On the products side, stronger runs suggest additional CPP export potential; however, much will depend on underlying domestic demand levels”, the shipbroker said.

Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory. The agency is due to publish its long-term view of energy markets next week, where it will reintroduce the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published in 2019. This scenario reflects only policies already in place, without assuming new measures, announcements, or enhanced targets. The agency will continue publishing its Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which goes one step further and includes both implemented policies and officially announced plans or targets that are likely to be implemented”.

“In the maritime sector, strong US opposition to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) was perhaps the key reason why the final vote on the agreed plan has been delayed by twelve months. In the weeks preceding the vote, the Trump administration warned that nations supporting the NZF could face retaliatory measures, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties. As a result, the industry is now facing an increased level of uncertainty – it is unlikely that the framework will be adopted in its current form next year”, Gibson noted.",,N,,2025-11-09 17:17:57.344665

Canada's Climate Competitiveness Strategy will help build Canada Strong by establishing a competitive advantage that will set us on track toward a more resilient economic and environmental future.","November 9, 2025 - Calgary, Alberta - Government of Canada

Climate action is not only a moral responsibility-it's an economic necessity. The global shift to a low-carbon economy is accelerating, changing how growth happens and where capital flows. To stay competitive, Canada must catalyse investment across clean and conventional sectors so our industries can meet the world's rising demand for low-carbon products and energy. In the face of global uncertainty, Canada's new government is focused on what we can control. How we respond to the challenge of climate disruptions will influence Canada's economic competitiveness, drive new investment opportunities and shape our global standing for generations to come. Canada must take action to fight climate change, drive down emissions and invest in building the economy of the future.

Today, the Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) highlighted Canada's Climate Competitiveness Strategy-a strategy based on driving investment and achieving results. Building on Canada's competitive advantages and global standing as a clean energy superpower, the strategy will strengthen our economy by:

Strengthening industrial carbon pricing

Providing clarity on regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

Boosting clean economy investment through tax credits

Supporting critical minerals projects

Mobilising capital for the transition to net-zero

Developing new metrics to track our success

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy will help Canada build the strongest economy in the G7. With this strategy, we can leverage Canada's unique strengths-like our abundant natural resources and innovation in clean technology-to attract investment, create good jobs in communities across the country, and ensure Canada continues to be competitive on the world stage.

November 9, 2025 - Calgary, Alberta - Government of Canada

Climate action is not only a moral responsibility-it's an economic necessity. The global shift to a low-carbon economy is accelerating, changing how growth happens and where capital flows. To stay competitive, Canada must catalyse investment across clean and conventional sectors so our industries can meet the world's rising demand for low-carbon products and energy. In the face of global uncertainty, Canada's new government is focused on what we can control. How we respond to the challenge of climate disruptions will influence Canada's economic competitiveness, drive new investment opportunities and shape our global standing for generations to come. Canada must take action to fight climate change, drive down emissions and invest in building the economy of the future.

Today, the Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) highlighted Canada's Climate Competitiveness Strategy-a strategy based on driving investment and achieving results. Building on Canada's competitive advantages and global standing as a clean energy superpower, the strategy will strengthen our economy by:

Strengthening industrial carbon pricing

Providing clarity on regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

Boosting clean economy investment through tax credits

Supporting critical minerals projects

Mobilising capital for the transition to net-zero

Developing new metrics to track our success

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy will help Canada build the strongest economy in the G7. With this strategy, we can leverage Canada's unique strengths-like our abundant natural resources and innovation in clean technology-to attract investment, create good jobs in communities across the country, and ensure Canada continues to be competitive on the world stage. Every step we take to build infrastructure, train workers, and support innovation in this is an investment in Canada's long-term prosperity.

Steve Pearce to head the public lands agency, drawing ire from environmentalists.

By Kiley Price for Inside Climate News

President Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped a conservation critic and former oil industry executive to head up the federal agency that oversees the majority of public lands in the United States.

If approved, former U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico will lead the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for balancing conservation of public lands with human use, such as resource extraction and cattle grazing. Since January, the Trump administration has overwhelmingly prioritized the latter with the Department of the Interior—BLM’s parent agency—rapidly approving oil, gas and mining permits, including more than 600 new permits to drill on public lands since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities.

Environmental groups have spoken out vehemently against Pearce, who they say will threaten public lands and ramp up activities that fuel global warming.

A veteran and former owner of an oilfield services company, Pearce began his foray into politics as the U.S. representative for New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District from 2003 to 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019. Over his seven terms in the role, Pearce strongly advocated for ranchers and the oil and gas drilling sector, the latter of which donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns. Now, industry groups are rallying around Pearce’s nomination.

“Pearce’s experience makes him thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing,” Kaitlynn Glover with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement. She also leads the Public Lands Council, which represents cattle and sheep ranchers with federal grazing permits.

Republican politicians from ranch- and oil-heavy states such as Montana and Wyoming echoed these sentiments.

“Steve’s leadership will be invaluable in managing our public lands and wisely stewarding our resources,” Senate Western Caucus Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said in a statement. “This nomination is a major win for Wyoming and the entire west, and I’m glad to see such a crucial role filled by someone so well qualified. I urge a swift confirmation.”

Meanwhile, conservation groups argue that Pearce is not fit to lead an agency that also manages some of the most ecologically sensitive lands in the country, open spaces that support clean water, clean air and wildlife. As a congressman, Pearce introduced or supported several public-lands bills that would have inhibited conservation, supported more climate-warming oil and gas operations and limited the power of the Antiquities Act, which gives the president authority to protect lands by designating them as national monuments.

In 2014, he opposed former President Barack Obama’s designation of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico, which had widespread public support in the region. He has said that the monument, which fell within his district, was too large. The protected area is now a major driver of tourism and income for the local community of Las Cruces.

The nonprofit League of Conservation Voters, which tracks congressional voting records on environmental issues, gives Pearce a score of 4 percent—with 13 votes over his career that the group classified as pro-environment and more than 330 deemed anti-environment.

“Pearce’s entire political career has been dedicated to blocking Americans’ access to public lands while giving the oil and gas industry free rein to drill and frack anywhere they wanted,” Jennifer Rokala, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement. “Congress should quickly reject this nomination and tell the president to pay attention to what voters overwhelmingly want—public lands that are protected and managed for our kids and grandkids.”

The nomination comes seven months after Trump’s former pick, Kathleen Sgamma, the head of an oil industry trade group, withdrew from consideration following reporting that she had privately criticized Trump in 2021.

The Trump Public Lands Agenda

Democratic politicians have also expressed concern over the Pearce nomination, including Deb Haaland, the former interior secretary under President Joe Biden, who called him a “dangerous choice.”

During her four-year tenure at the Interior Department, Haaland oversaw BLM’s operations and helped enact the 2024 Public Lands Rule, which placed conservation on equal footing with uses such as natural gas drilling, mining, ranching, grazing, timber production and recreation. In September the Trump administration declared its intent to rescind the rule.

“In New Mexico we value our lands and waters, and we need a manager who would be a good steward. Steve Pearce however, has a record of threatening New Mexico’s public lands, putting profits over people, and neglecting the needs of our state,” Haaland, who is now running for New Mexico governor, said in a statement. “He is the wrong choice to serve in this role.”

Since Trump re-entered office in January, the administration has coordinated an aggressive rollback of environmental laws and policies in the United States in a push to ramp up extractive activities on public lands.

In July, the White House began the process of changing how the landmark National Environmental Policy Act is implemented across the federal government in a manner that allows the fast-tracking of fossil fuel, mining and other industrial projects. One of the first to benefit from these streamlined reviews is a gold mine project in Nevada, with far less opportunity for public comment on its permitting. Opponents fear the lack of review will threaten key aquifers and land for vulnerable animals such as the sage grouse.

Along with fast-tracking permits, the Trump administration is opening more lands for oil drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Dan Ritzman, the director of conservation at the nonprofit Sierra Club, expects Pearce would run BLM in line with this pro-extractive agenda.

“Steve Pearce is right in line with the Trump’s administration’s vision that the most important use and the people that should have the most say in our public lands are oil and gas industry executives,” Ritzman said.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, the Trump administration doubled down on increasing oil and gas as a main goal.

“President Trump was elected with an overwhelming mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash America’s energy potential,” said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House. “It’s totally logical that his nominees would align with the agenda the President was elected to implement and have a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1496818/story_image/AP25309760864310.jpg?1762533172,N,,2025-11-09 16:03:44.497260

However, in a surprising strategic shift, the company is pinning its hopes on a miniature vehicle for the Japanese market. This unexpected move raises a critical question: can this new direction stabilize the company's declining share value?

European Operations Offer a Silver Lining

As challenges mount in its home market, BYD's international business is experiencing explosive growth. Overseas revenue surged by an impressive 160 percent during the third quarter of 2025. Europe has emerged as a particularly bright spot, with BYD now commanding 30 percent of all Chinese automobile sales in Western Europe.

The company achieved a historic milestone by leading Chinese brands past their Korean competitors in Western European markets for the first time. The United Kingdom serves as a strategic bridgehead for further regional expansion. Despite this success, vehicle margins contracted to 21 percent, indicating that even BYD's vertically integrated battery manufacturing cannot completely offset industry-wide pricing pressures. Additional complications arise from regulatory uncertainties and ongoing compliance disputes.

Third Quarter Performance Disappoints

Recent financial disclosures for Q3 2025 revealed the depth of BYD's current challenges. The company reported a 3.05 percent decline in revenue, which fell to 194.985 billion yuan. More concerning was the net profit figure, which plummeted by 32.6 percent to 7.823 billion yuan.

Ad

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying BYD?

October vehicle sales dropped 12 percent to 441,706 units, reflecting the brutal price competition in China's EV sector. Rivals including Geely and Great Wall Motor are gaining market share through aggressive discount strategies.

Valuation metrics present additional concerns. BYD's price-to-earnings ratio of 21.9 significantly exceeds the industry average of 9.6, creating vulnerability for the stock should growth continue to weaken.

Japan Strategy: The Raccoon Initiative

In a dramatic departure from its established premium vehicle approach, BYD has announced the ""Racco"" – named after the Japanese word for raccoon dog (tanuki). This compact car specifically targets Japan's unique Kei-Car segment with the following specifications:

* Compact dimensions measuring 3.5 meters in length and approximately 2 meters in height

* 20 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery pack

* Scheduled market debut in summer 2026

* Direct competition with Nissan's Sakura model

This strategic pivot demonstrates BYD's willingness to explore niche markets beyond its traditional rivalry with Tesla, potentially opening new revenue streams as domestic pressures intensify.

The electric vehicle startup has a series of videos on its YouTube page giving some insight into the development, and the latest looks at the extensive hot-weather testing prototypes – and their engineers – have to endure.

The video depicts testing that took place during the summer in some of the desert regions of Nevada. Not only do the prototypes have to survive the heat, they also need to keep their cool – quite literally – while doing activities that stress key systems like the battery and electric motors. One of the tests involved towing a trailer up a steep grade while also carrying a payload.

Conditions like extreme heat or cold can take a toll on an EV's powertrain. For example, a battery that's too warm will have its ability to deliver power diminished. And when the battery gets too cold, range can be reduced significantly. To get around this, modern EVs are equipped with special heating and cooling systems designed to keep the vehicles operating at optimal temperatures.

Prices Subject To Change

Slate is the Jeff Bezos-backed, Michigan-based startup developing a small bare-bones electric truck that at its debut in April, was promised with a final price of less than $20,000 after factoring in federal incentives. Those incentives have expired since the debut, and Slate's website has since been updated with an expected price in the mid-$20,000 bracket. The first examples are due for delivery toward the end of 2026, and Slate states that pricing could still change further.

As the name suggests, the Slate Truck will be a sort of blank slate that customers will be able to personalize – and Slate is promising plenty of options that no doubt will quickly inflate the sticker. For example, all Slates will start out life with the same gray finish, but the company will offer wraps for anyone wanting to add color. There will also be an SUV kit that will turn the standard two-seat truck into a five-seat SUV. This kit will also come in three different flavors: either a standard SUV body, a sporty fastback body, or an open-top body with no roof or windows.

Key Specifications

The Slate Truck measures just 174.6 inches long, making it only slightly longer than a compact Nissan Leaf. Despite the small size, the bed will still be a decent five feet, which is the same for some configurations of midsize trucks like the Ford Ranger and Nissan Frontier. Slate quotes a maximum payload of 1,433 pounds and towing capacity of 1,000 pounds, so don't expect to do any heavy lifting with this truck.

The Slate Truck is powered by a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 201 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. It comes standard with a 52.7-kilowatt-hour battery (estimated 150 miles of range), with an optional 84.3-kWh pack boosting range to about 240 miles. Charging is handled via a Tesla-compatible NACS port, with DC fast-charging up to 120 kilowatts, allowing 20%-80% charging in about 30 minutes, according to the company's website.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/slate-truck-4.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-09 15:18:51.844835

In Germany, a troubling debate is gathering pace: could Stuttgart, the heart of the country’s car industry, follow Detroit’s path? Experts are divided. Some argue Germany moved too slowly on electric vehicles and now risks surrendering its lead. Others believe Stuttgart can still avoid a crash if it keeps a steady balance between established manufacturing and emerging technologies.

Jürgen Dispan of the IMU Institute in Stuttgart treats Detroit less as a verdict and more as a warning. He notes that the region rests on a broader industrial base—from mechanical engineering to R&D and engineering centers. Yet, in his view, survival depends on keeping development and production tightly linked to maintain momentum through electrification. That alignment is not a slogan; it will decide who sets the pace.

The challenge is sharpened by high labor costs and shorter working hours, which make German cars more expensive. Researcher Stefan Bratzel recalls that these very factors once sped Detroit’s decline, as American brands reacted too late to market pressures. The parallel with Detroit is hard to ignore.

For now, the notion of a German Detroit remains a hypothesis, but the concern is justified. The global auto industry is being remade: the software-defined, electric, automated vehicle is no longer a question of if. For Stuttgart, the issue is not timing but readiness to lead the next era.

Stuttgart is unlikely to become a second Detroit, but the time for deliberation is over. If Germany intends to preserve its leadership, it will need to stop defending the past and start building the future.",https://speedme.ru/uploads/en_materials/big_webp/zRwDXMHBhEiUgGllb4wt.webp,N,,2025-11-09 16:18:25.703318

Opinion | How to Fix America’s Soaring Electricity Prices | The New York Times (gift link)

The cost of electricity is a highly salient political issue now. Tyler Norris has some ideas for how to bend the curve and, as usual, there’s a Texas angle.

For the moment, higher power bills stem mostly from volatile natural gas prices and the costs utilities are passing on to customers to modernize the aging grid and rebuild power lines and substations damaged by wildfires in the West, hurricanes along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and other extreme weather.

Electricity markets are also beginning to feel the squeeze from an explosive growth in new users. Take the country’s largest power market, serving the Mid-Atlantic and some of the Midwest, where tight supply and dozens of new data centers have led to a nearly tenfold jump in the cost of guaranteeing enough power supply when it’s most needed.

The new electricity demand doesn’t automatically raise bills. A recent study showed that states where electricity use grew fastest often saw average household prices fall, while states with flat or declining use saw prices rise. The impact depends, in significant part, on how cleverly the existing grid is managed — and whether that new energy demand occurs at times when the grid is already strained.

…[In] Texas, regulators are beginning to require large users to be the first to cut their power use during emergencies, helping spare households from outages.

The federal government is now validating this approach. In an extraordinary move, on Oct. 23 the Department of Energy directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to propose a rule that would allow new data centers and factories to plug into the grid years sooner if they agree to lower their use during the rare hours when supplies run tight. The proposal has drawn strikingly broad, bipartisan support.

Some data centers that specialize in instant, on-demand services — like web search, streaming or chat — may find it impractical to dial back during peak hours. But even then, similar benefits can be achieved if data centers pay residential and business electricity consumers to shift their use during extreme peak hours with smart thermostats, networked appliances and battery systems that can adjust automatically. That could provide the same relief for the system while data centers compensate other users directly. (emphasis added).

I covered this idea of data centers paying for electricity demand – and cost – reductions on the podcast with Astrid Atkinson of Camus Energy and recorded one with Tyler on data center flexibility as well.

China’s clean-energy revolution will reshape markets and politics | The Economist (gift link)

The Economist did a fantastic job in a series of articles exploring China’s energy dominance.

The US absolutely could provide a meaningful counterweight – something I explored with American solar manufacturer T1 – but it would require broad political consensus to pursue an all-of-the-above strategy that includes both molecules and electrons, fossils and renewables.

The scale of the renewables revolution in China is almost too vast for the human mind to grasp… The 22m tonnes of steel used to build new wind turbines and solar panels in 2024 would have been enough to build a Golden Gate Bridge on every working day of every week that year…

In the context of the cold war, the distinctive measure of a “superpower” was the combination of a continental span and a world-threatening nuclear arsenal. The coming-together of China’s enormous manufacturing capacity and its ravenous appetite for copious, cheap, domestically produced electricity deserves to be seen in a similar world-changing light. They have made China a new type of superpower: one which deploys clean electricity on a planetary scale.

China is exporting its revolution to the rest of the world. America’s current government rejects renewable technologies. In Europe industry is hollowing out and voters are rebelling against expensive green policies. But it is in developing countries that the fight against climate change will be won or lost, and it is there that Chinese renewables will make the most difference.

China is now making more money from exporting green technology than America makes from exporting fossil fuels. This trend will continue simply because renewables are cheap; if you doubt the appeal, count the solar panels on Pakistani roofs.

Even if you don’t care about climate change at all for national security and economic reasons alone, the US needs to have a share of the renewable export market. If it happens, Texas will play a major role – and reap the benefits of having both electrons and molecules to export.

Most of these lawsuits have been launched by blue cities and states in friendly jurisdictions, banking on judges to link state consumer protection and nuisance laws with global climate change.
Research by economist Wayne Winegarden indicates that combining energy lawsuits seeking damages at (a conservative) $100 billion equates to a 31 cents per gallon price increase for consumers at the pump — meaning an extra $326 per household per year.
President Trump has vowed to put an end to the climate lawsuits, but his executive orders can only go so far.
v. Suncor Energy argues the court should recognize lawmakers’ role in regulating emissions and swat away state-level attempts at punishing oil and gas firms for climate change.","The Trump administration is taking a well-earned victory lap after successfully delaying a carbon tax on the shipping and logistics industry at a United Nations meeting in London last month.

“The U.S. achieved a diplomatic victory and successfully rallied a coalition to stop the body’s proposed ‘net-zero framework,’” wrote Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the effort to delay by one year a proposal to implement new climate rules at the International Maritime Organization.

Our diplomats are right to celebrate Americans being shielded from new taxes on their energy consumption coming from abroad, but right here at home, new costs are being folded into household energy budgets every day. Anyone with a gas tank to fill or house to heat is feeling it.

For the last decade in local courts, municipalities and states have waged their own legal battles against American energy providers to extract massive settlements over their alleged failure to acknowledge culpability in global climate change.

Most of these lawsuits have been launched by blue cities and states in friendly jurisdictions, banking on judges to link state consumer protection and nuisance laws with global climate change. It is no coincidence that most cases have been launched in places like Colorado, California and Hawaii, and progressive college town enclaves such as Carrboro, N.C., where more sympathetic district judges might allow cases to proceed.

These efforts have been coordinated by well-connected groups of state attorneys generals, university law programs and millions of dollars in funding from philanthropists who believe that climate litigation will help “bankrupt” oil and gas firms. David Bookbinder, a director at the Environmental Integrity Project who formerly was on the legal team in the suit launched against oil firms by the city of Boulder, Colo., recently admitted as much.

For many climate activists who have turned to the courts, the use of tort law is a deliberate attempt to weaponize America’s litigation addiction to further their goals of reining in fossil fuel companies, no matter the cost to consumers. It’s a carbon tax by another name. Research by economist Wayne Winegarden indicates that combining energy lawsuits seeking damages at (a conservative) $100 billion equates to a 31 cents per gallon price increase for consumers at the pump — meaning an extra $326 per household per year.

We all pay for this. And although a lot of attention has been given to the role that data centers are playing in local debates about energy bills, not enough has been said as to the adverse effect of ideological climate lawfare.

Where does this all end? President Trump has vowed to put an end to the climate lawsuits, but his executive orders can only go so far.

The Supreme Court has so far declined to take up the matter or force disputes to federal courts, but Congress has made its opinion known. A recent amicus brief filed by Republicans in County Commissioners of Boulder County. v. Suncor Energy argues the court should recognize lawmakers’ role in regulating emissions and swat away state-level attempts at punishing oil and gas firms for climate change.

If that brief ends up convincing members of the high bench, it will be to the advantage of American consumers, who depend on affordable energy to power their lives. If these lawsuits can continue unabated, there is no telling what the economic consequences will be. At the very least they cause a slow, almost invisible drag on the economy.

Whatever happens, Americans need to know that backdoor carbon taxes and shakedown schemes are being cooked up regularly by international bureaucrats in faraway capitals, and many more are brewing here at home, right in our own courts.

India is set to become an expert in the domestic wind power manufacturing sector","As the world faces increased pressure on the energy sector, several nations are turning to wind power to alleviate the stress. Most nations have some degree of flexibility in their energy portfolios; however, some nations have stagnated in their embrace of the renewable energy sector. One nation that has become a global leader in wind power component manufacturing is India. India has an exceedingly large population, which means that demand for energy outpaces supply most of the time. As such, the Indian government has called on the domestic manufacturing sector to pick up the pace.

India’s government has called on the wind power sector to increase manufacturing

Several prominent Indian officials have called on the domestic wind manufacturing sector to increase production dramatically. At a recent wind power event, India’s Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, said that domestic value addition is crucial for the nation to foster a competitive wind power component manufacturing sector that can compete with the rest of the world.

“With indigenisation and high local content, India can capture 10 percent of the global wind supply chain by 2030 and further to 20 percent by 2040. For India is among the five countries that manufacture the most wind components domestically.” – India’s Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi

India has some of the worst emission numbers on the planet, with several cities being blanketed in a cloud of smog that is equivalent to smoking several packs of cigarettes a day, on a good day. As a result, the nation has planned to increase spending on renewable energy production, like wind power. Additionally, India is leaning on the extensive and often overlooked work ethic of its populace to become a global leader in manufacturing wind power components.

India’s government has called for an increase in wind component production to 85%

At the recent 7th edition of ‘Windergy India 2025’, government officials called on the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMS), or any other wind power component manufacturers, to increase domestic production from the current levels of 65% to an astonishing 85% in order to effectively compete with other nations.

Wind energy currently accounts for nearly one-fifth of India’s energy generation capacity, and the government wants to increase that reliance on the sector dramatically. India has become an essential provider of crucial wind components for the world, as many nations struggle with China’s dominance in the supply chain.

““Amidst evolving global dynamics and rising geo-political challenges, it is necessary to align with the vision of the Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat in clean energy. The goal is to achieve the renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030, in which wind power will play a crucial role by contributing 100 GW or more.” – India’s Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi

The minister also noted that India already has a foothold in the international wind power supply chain, with orders in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Brazil, not to mention that India is challenging China’s supply chain with orders from several Asian nations.

How can there be such a contrast? The truth is that while the US president’s posture on climate change represents an extreme, few people in the US really believe that such a transformation of the energy system is possible. This is true, I think, even of the advocates for that transformation. I am one of those advocates, and even I haven’t fully believed in its possibility. I was more likely to believe that the truth lay closer to a declaration by Mark Mills, a former senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, that a transition away from society’s dependence on hydrocarbons “is not feasible in any meaningful time frame”.

Why was I so skeptical that this transformation could take place? Those realists who doubt that it can occur within a reasonable time frame point to several facts. First, energy transitions in the past have taken a century, not decades. And they have never been complete. Coal replaced wood, but dependence on wood lingered on for many people. Oil replaced coal, but coal continued to be used in massive amounts. Natural gas pushed some coal and oil aside, but those fuels still sell in massive quantities. And nuclear energy surged for two or three decades but never pushed coal aside.

They also point out that while solar and wind power are surging throughout the globe — it is often said that nearly all new power generation in recent years has been wind and solar — the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has continued to rise at about the same pace as it has for almost 70 years.

Also contributing to my own skepticism was the poor arguments the enthusiasts for wind and solar made for the economic viability of these renewables. They claimed that it had been proved that wind and solar were the cheapest forms of energy. But as evidence for that claim, they cited levelized cost-of-energy comparisons performed by a financial firm, Lazard Freres. Comparisons on that basis of wind and solar with coal, gas, and nuclear are, however, apples-to-oranges comparisons because they don’t consider the whole system cost.

Such biased and incomplete arguments for wind and solar on the part of too many of its advocates, often made with an attitude of complete certainty, as if these were undeniable scientific facts, provoked skepticism.

But I have changed my mind. This change of mind was cemented by a book I just read, Clearing the Air: A Hopeful Guide to Solving Climate Change — in 50 Questions and Answers, by Hannah Ritchie, a data scientist and senior researcher at the University of Oxford and deputy editor at Our World in Data. Ritchie does not express the exaggerated aspirations that overenthusiastic renewables advocates proclaim; she is more realistic about the energy transition. She advises the enthusiastic advocates to “stop obsessing over arbitrary targets (such as, for example, ‘net zero by 2050’) and focus on how you can help to reduce our carbon emissions as quickly as possible”. She says, “A completely fossil-free world is not going to happen overnight. Not even in the next 20 years. We should be upfront about that. It is a transition, not an on-off switch.”

The truth is that while the US president’s posture on climate change represents an extreme, few people in the US really believe that such a transformation of the energy system is possible

But then she shows in 50 concise chapters how the transition can take place, perhaps even soon, and it is all credible. Technologies for some of them are not ready yet, and many are still too expensive. But it makes Mills’ statement “not feasible in any meaningful time frame” seem far too pessimistic.

As for China’s coal plants, she points out that “China has been using its coal plants less and less. In the early 2000s, plants were running around 70 percent of the time, but this has since dropped to around 50 percent and will keep falling”. China is using its coal plants in the same way that the US is using gas, to deal with the intermittency of renewables — that is, to generate electricity when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Solving this problem in the long run will require better and lower-cost batteries, and long-distance transmission lines, on both of which China is a leader. And it will likely require large quantities of nuclear energy too, the construction of which China again leads.

We find it hard to believe that a transition away from the energy systems we have all been used to for many decades will really happen. The habit of extrapolation is in human nature. What we have been doing is, we feel intuitively, likely to be what we will be doing, no matter the hype around artificial intelligence, or the energy transition, or climate change itself. It may be advisable to pay some attention to this intuition when it comes to AI, but not when it comes to climate change and the energy transition.

Ritchie makes a seemingly unremarkable but highly pertinent observation toward the end of the book that wraps it up well: “We accept that changes have happened in the past but are skeptical that tomorrow, next year or the next decade will be much different. When it comes to climate technologies, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Things are changing quickly.”

Natural gas acts as a stabilizer of the system.
Energean has demonstrated that natural gas production can be done with a very low carbon footprint, as shown by our activity in Israel.","The new geopolitical and energy landscape emerging after the transatlantic conference in Athens, attended by top American and European officials, signals a clear upgrade of Greece’s role as a strategic partner of the United States in Southeastern Europe. The strengthened American presence confirmed Washington’s intention to further deepen relations with Athens, highlighting our country as a key energy and geopolitical point between East and West.

The total valuation of the agreements supported by the new era in Greek-American relations exceeds €30 billion, as it rests on two parallel pillars of cooperation.

The first concerns the natural gas and LNG infrastructure sector, with an estimated value of about €26 billion over 20 years, while the second relates to accelerating cooperation in hydrocarbons, which could yield investments of €5 to €10 billion under certain conditions, at least regarding the Ionian block, into which ExxonMobil recently entered. The scale of these investments will be multiple if discoveries are made in the blocks south and southwest of Crete, which will open the way – provided licensing obstacles and potential legal disputes are overcome – for the country to become a natural gas producer for the first time.

The first pillar is implemented within the framework of the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy and Climate Cooperation (P-TEC), where the close energy ties between the two countries were transformed into specific agreements for the supply and absorption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) quantities ranging from 0.7 to 4 billion cubic meters per year, with prices calculated based on current natural gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub (€33/MWh).

This first multi-year contract with the USA in Europe is acquired by Atlantic See LNG Trade S.A. This is the newly established joint company between Aktor and DEPA Commercial at 60%-40%, which on Friday signed the 20-year supply contract with the American Venture Global – one of the largest LNG players based in Louisiana. This is an agreement that Americans link to the Alexandroupolis terminal (FSRU), in which the company participates with a capacity of 25%.

Through the FSRU infrastructure, Greece aims to increase imports of liquefied natural gas from the USA for export through the so-called Vertical Corridor, which connects Greece with Ukraine via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. Greece’s role in natural gas transportation is expected to increase further when the EU proceeds with a complete ban on Russian supplies, as decided from 2028. When the transit of Russian gas through Turk Stream (the main gateway of Russian gas to Southeast Europe) ends, it is estimated that about 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas will need to be immediately replaced, while together with neighboring countries’ needs, the quantities are estimated at 20 to 22 bcm.

Agreements with the countries of the Vertical Corridor (Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Moldova), with which individual negotiations will follow to finalize quantities, foresee a minimum annual supply of up to 700 million cubic meters, which will serve as a consumption and absorption threshold for the system’s viability. This minimum quantity ensures stable flows and predictability for infrastructure investments, allowing banks and institutional financiers to safely support transport and storage projects. A key role in this sector is played by the DFC (Development Finance Corporation). The US State Development Bank is considering having an active role in the agreement linked to the DEPA Commercial – Aktor joint venture, which is Greek-based and operates in seven countries in the region.

According to information, the American presence will not be limited to simple lending but will include equity participation and board representation in the company, making it the US arm in Southeast Europe for energy security matters. The presence of the DFC is expected to act as a multiplier of trust and stability for the broader investment structure, facilitating access to capital and the participation of American and European banks.

The significance of the deal for Aktor

The agreement for American LNG marks a new era for Aktor as well, expanding its activity beyond construction into energy, with a deal that strengthens its position as a national energy player with an international footprint. From a company that built infrastructure projects, it is transformed within a few years into a group actively participating in energy production and distribution, representing the most ambitious project the company has ever undertaken, placing it at the center of developments for the coming decades.

The plan even includes investment in LNG transport ships, with a total cost of about €1 billion. The company will need to evaluate in the coming period whether to charter or purchase LNG transport vessels from the US, given that the transport cost is estimated at €30–40 million per year.

Contract duration

The start of the long-term contract to supply the countries of the Vertical Energy Corridor with American LNG is set for 2030, with intermediate phases in 2027–2028, when the final withdrawal of Russian natural gas from the European market is expected. Already, at the end of 2026, DEPA Commercial’s contract with Gazprom expires. Although the last negotiation with the Russians, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement due to a long-standing dispute over gas pricing, provides for an extension, a plan is being promoted for the gradual termination of Russian gas flows by 2027.

As well-informed sources report, the United States clearly intends to cooperate with a unified and reliable partner in the region. The Greek company, in which DEPA and Aktor will participate, will fulfill this purpose, functioning as the US energy arm for Southeast and Central Europe. For the success of the project, it is emphasized that long-term contracts are required, such as the 20-year contract with Venture Global, which will provide investment security and allow financing of new infrastructure, such as floating regasification stations (new FSRUs) and new interconnection pipelines. These infrastructures will increase the volume of natural gas transport and contribute to price reduction through economies of scale.

On the discussion table is also the prospect of constructing a pipeline between Alexandroupolis and Ukraine, which would further strengthen the region’s energy security. Although considered an ambitious plan, it is emphasized that guaranteed transport volumes supported by geopolitical developments and significant financing are required. In the new energy map shaped by the withdrawal of Russian gas from the European market, Ukraine is also considered a country of strategic importance due to its large storage capacity (about 30 bcm), corresponding to 15% of total European storage capacity. Utilizing this capacity provides stability in gas supply and will enhance Europe’s energy autonomy, especially after progressive disengagement from Russian gas.

The drilling rigs

The second pillar of Greek-American cooperation concerns accelerating research and investments in hydrocarbons. ExxonMobil, with a 60% stake in Ionian Block 2, proceeds in collaboration with the Greek side, with the remaining 30% allocated to Greek Energean, which manages the Prinos field in Kavala, and 10% to Helleniq Energy (formerly Hellenic Petroleum). The American upstream giant has also undertaken the processing of 3D seismic data for the offshore blocks “Southwest” and “West of Crete,” also with Helleniq Energy.

ExxonMobil Vice President John Ardill stated in recent days that the data processing will be completed in the first half of 2026 so that a decision can be made on whether an exploratory drilling will take place in 2027 in the “Southwest Crete” block. This issue remains open for the company, which has been present in Greece since 2019, confirming that the reality of hydrocarbons is far more complex than usually presented.

INTERVIEW

Mathios Rigas: CEO of Energean

“A discovery in Block 2 will have a catalytic effect on Greece’s development”

$80 million investment in exploratory drilling, multiples if a field is found – Potential resources 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Ionian

An investment of $80 million for exploratory drilling, which will be multiple if a field is found, opens with the participation of Americans in the Ionian concession. Energean and ExxonMobil are proceeding with exploratory drilling in Block 2, west of Corfu, one of the most promising areas of the Mediterranean, with potential resources reaching 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Energean CEO Mathios Rigas explains to THEMA the significance of the agreement, the next steps, and the role of natural gas in the new energy reality.

Marianna Tzanne: What does your cooperation with ExxonMobil for Block 2 signify?

Mathios Rigas: The agreement is of strategic importance both for Energean and for the country. ExxonMobil participates with 60%, Energean with 30%, remaining operator in the first phase, and HelleniQ Energy with 10%. The fact that a global energy giant trusts us to manage the critical exploratory drilling shows our technical competence and reliability.

The cooperation was based on data from the 2022 three-dimensional seismic survey, covering an area of over 2,200 square kilometers. After a year of negotiations, an $80 million investment was set in motion – an important step for Greece’s energy independence. If a discovery occurs, the investments will be multiple, while ExxonMobil will undertake the development phase.

The presence of American officials at the signing of the agreement underlines that this is a move with geopolitical dimension, integrated into the US strategy for energy stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.

M.T.: What are the next steps and what challenges do you foresee for Block 2?

M.R.: The first crucial step is exploratory drilling, expected at the end of 2026 or early 2027, if the licensing procedures proceed without delays. The big challenge is European bureaucracy: regulations have become more complex, imposing checks that often act as a disincentive.

Balance, transparency, and responsibility are needed, but without harming competitiveness. Europe must maintain the ability to attract investments, especially in the energy sector. The example of Prinos shows that in Greece we can combine production and environmental protection: it has operated for 45 years in full harmony with tourism and fishing, something we are proud of.

M.T.: How does this project fit into Greece’s energy security strategy?

M.R.: Greece has progressed in diversifying energy sources and routes, but still depends on imports. The existence of domestic fields is not just an economic issue; it is a matter of national power and independence.

The development of Block 2 and other fields can strengthen an energy security network connecting Greece, Cyprus, Israel, Egypt, and Italy. This is also the essence of Energean’s strategy for the Mediterranean: creating a stable regional pillar.

In 2024, Energean produced 7.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Mediterranean, a quantity greater than the country’s current consumption. This experience gives us confidence that we can contribute substantially to Greece’s energy self-sufficiency.

M.T.: What is the role of natural gas in Europe’s green transition?

M.R.: For years we talked about energy transition, meaning replacing fossil fuels with cleaner forms. Today, however, reality is different: needs are increasing, networks require stable power, and renewables cannot yet meet demand without a reliable baseload source.

Natural gas acts as a stabilizer of the system. Globally, more than $4 trillion is expected to be invested in the energy sector in the coming years. The issue is not simply “transition” but the “addition” of clean and reliable energy.

Energean has demonstrated that natural gas production can be done with a very low carbon footprint, as shown by our activity in Israel. With the carbon dioxide storage project in Prinos, we take another step toward the green transition.",https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/xrwma-deals-1.jpg-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 14:03:35.015931

TORONTO, Nov. 9, 2025 /CNW/ - Global trade upheavals, rapid technological change, and the clean transition are reshaping the world economy. Canada's economic strategy must adapt--and fast. Budget 2025: Canada Strong is our plan to make our economy stronger, more self-sufficient, and resilient to global shocks. It will catalyse over $1 trillion in investment over the next five years, driving growth in nuclear, hydro, wind, energy storage, and grid infrastructure to make Canada a leader in the low-carbon economy.

Investing in a clean future is both a moral imperative and the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. As the world moves toward net zero, Canada's climate competitiveness will define Canada's leadership on the world stage. By 2035, the clean technology market will triple, and demand for clean electricity will double. To compete, Canada's investment must keep pace.

Today, the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, outlined the government's new Climate Competitiveness Strategy at the Pearl Street Energy Centre in Toronto. The strategy, which positions Canada to compete and win in this new global landscape, is anchored by three pillars:

Boosting investment through Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits to make it more affordable for Canadian industries to transition to clean energy, modernise electricity grids, expand renewables, increase energy storage, and strengthen power connections across provinces. Our plan will:

Implement the 15% Clean Electricity investment tax credit and remove the conditions imposed on provincial and territorial governments for their Crown corporations to be eligible.

Expand the list of critical minerals eligible for the 30% Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit.

Supercharge affordable, net-zero energy projects with the following tax credits:

Clean Technology, expanding eligibility to include systems that produce electricity, heat, or both electricity and heat from waste biomass and changed the eligibility requirements for small nuclear energy.

Clean Hydrogen, introducing availability for hydrogen produced from methane pyrolysis under this tax credit.

Extend the full value of the Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage investment tax credit by five years through 2035.

Strengthening industrial carbon pricing to reduce emissions and provide long-term certainty for businesses and investors. Effective industrial carbon markets are integral to driving investment in clean growth and emissions reductions. We are committing to improving carbon markets across the country to provide the confidence and predictability that industry requires to invest and grow. Our plan will:

Engage with provinces and territories to develop a post-2030 carbon pricing trajectory. We will set an industrial carbon price trajectory that supports net-zero by 2050, giving businesses the confidence they need to make long-term investments in climate competitiveness.

Engage with provincial and territorial governments on improvements to the federal benchmark. This process will ensure pricing systems across the country are working effectively and enable the implementation of a strengthened benchmark. Additionally, we will explore opportunities to harmonise or link carbon credit markets.

Apply the federal backstop whenever a provincial or territorial system falls below a strengthened federal benchmark, to ensure a stringent price signal and level playing field across the country.

The Canada Growth Fund will continue to issue contracts for difference as a means of further improving future carbon price certainty for investors making large, long-duration capital investments.

Clarifying greenhouse gas regulations, including finalizing enhanced methane regulations for the oil and gas sector. By tightening these regulations, we will significantly reduce emissions across Canada, while providing clarity and predictability for industry. We will also finalise new methane regulations for landfills. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases--80 times more harmful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period--and one of the easiest to reduce.

In parallel, Canada's new government is investing in the critical minerals that will power the clean energy future. Budget 2025 commits over $2 billion in new investments over five years to accelerate production, create thousands of new-high-paying careers, and strengthen our position in this strategic global market. Through a new Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, the First and Last Mile Fund, and expanded eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, we will bring more Canadian critical minerals projects into production and unlock the next generation of clean technology supply chains, from electric vehicles to advanced manufacturing.

Combined, these measures form a bold new strategy to supercharge Canadian competitiveness in the global transformation to clean energy. By investing in our people, technologies, and natural resources, we can strengthen our economy today, build resilience for the future, and position Canada as a clean energy superpower in a net-zero world.

Quotes

""Canada must act with urgency, unity, and determination. At this critical moment, we have a choice: lead--and seize the opportunities of the energy transition--or get left behind. With the Climate Competitiveness Strategy, we are positioning climate action and economic growth as inseparable, aiming to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more competitive Canada for decades to come. This will help us take action in a way that prioritises affordability for Canadians and strengthens our economy.""

– The Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

""Canada is securing our place as a global energy and resource superpower--and by doing it responsibly and sustainably, we are securing wins for Canadians and the planet. We know what a strong economy and clean environment require, and our Strategy provides it: clarity and predictability that drives innovation, attracts investment, and mobilises capital. We have a responsibility to protect Canada's environment and economy for generations to come, and that delivery starts now.""

– The Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources

Quick facts

The Strategy outlines clear rules that will cut emissions, drive innovation, and attract investment. Public and private capital will be mobilised toward a net-zero economy, establishing sustainable investment guidelines, a Sustainable Bonds Framework, improving climate disclosures in collaboration with provinces and territories, and amending anti-greenwashing provisions to improve investor certainty.

Our government's commitment to a low-carbon economy is reflected in the work of the Major Projects Office (MPO). One of the criteria for designation as a Project of National Interest is how a project will contribute to clean growth and to Canada's objectives with respect to climate change. This office will continue to evaluate projects for fast-tracking based in part on their contributions to clean growth and Canada's climate goals.

The first unit of the Darlington New Nuclear Project will provide reliable and affordable clean power to 300,000 homes, and position Canada as a global leader in the deployment of this technology worldwide.

Expected to be the first net-zero copper project in Canada, the McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine Project will strengthen Canada's supply of critical minerals, creating hundreds of new careers across local economies.

The Red Chris Mine expansion will increase Canada's annual copper production by over 15% and reduce the mine's greenhouse gas emissions by over 70% when operational.

Wind West could be Canada's first offshore wind development and will set the scale, direction and trajectory for future growth. Unlocking 5,000 MW in the first phase could produce 24 TWh of clean energy every year and drive billions in new investment and economic activity across Canada, led by the private sector. This Eastern Energy Partnership could include important projects like interties between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, transmission cables between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick as well as Quebec's and Newfoundland and Labrador's further development of Churchill Falls and Gull Island.

Alto High-Speed Railway, spanning approximately 1,000 km from Toronto to Quebec City and reaching speeds of up to 300km/hour to cut travel times in half and connect close to half of Canada's population. This project targets 25 million tonnes of CO2 emissions savings, the creation of 51,000 new jobs and 63,000 new housing units along its route.

This approach also extends beyond those industries. In homebuilding, factory-built homes will give more Canadians an affordable place to live while cutting emissions by over 20% compared with traditional construction methods.

Carbon pricing systems are a major component of Canada's clean investment landscape. Seventy major decarbonization projects across the country, collectively worth over $57 billion, are supported by industrial carbon markets. Around $4.3 billion in annual clean energy investment is linked directly to the existence of carbon pricing for large industrial emitters.

Budget 2025 commits to implementing the 15 % Clean Electricity investment tax credit, which will be available once legislation is passed and guidance finalized. This can cover 15 % of capital costs of eligible investment in equipment related to low-emitting electricity generation, electricity storage and interjurisdictional transmission projects.

In 2024, global investments in clean energy reached over $2.8 trillion--nearly double the level of investment in fossil fuels--and the global clean technology market is expected to triple by 2035.

The government will provide transparent updates on progress and introduce new metrics to measure how businesses and households are cutting emissions, how the clean economy is expanding, and how Canadian exports are tracking to achieve world-leading emissions intensity.

Climate change is a growing threat to Canada and the world. We are already seeing the risks and costs of climate change through extreme weather events like wildfires, drought, floods, and more severe storms. Over the last decade, the average yearly cost of weather-related disasters and catastrophic losses has risen to the equivalent of 5 to 6% of Canada's annual GDP growth. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says that extreme weather events caused $9.2 billion in insured losses in 2024.

Nations’ emission reduction commitments, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), have collectively fallen short of the Paris Agreement goals, according to the U.N.’s latest NDC Synthesis Report. As such, Palau on behalf of the Association of Small Island States has proposed an agenda item to accelerate near-term climate ambition especially as the danger of surpassing the crucial 1.5 degrees Celsius goal is evident. Countries will also need to reach agreement on indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation, an issue made more urgent by dire climate impacts already unfolding and most acutely harming the lowest income nations. Scaling up climate finance to at least $1.3 trillion by 2035 is the focus of the Baku to Belém Roadmap to support lower-income countries transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change.

The Trump administration is unlikely to send an official delegation to COP30, which would be a COP first, while the United States’s formal exit from the Paris Agreement will take effect in January 2026. A contingent of U.S. leaders representing states, cities, Tribal nations, businesses and other institutions will be in Belém to demonstrate continued commitment to the goals of the Agreement.

Below is a statement by Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). She has more than 20 years of experience working on international climate and energy issues, is a regular attendee of the annual U.N. climate talks and is attending COP30.

“World leaders coming to Belém must face up to the undeniable scientific and real-world evidence of their grossly insufficient efforts thus far to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. At COP30, they must commit to meeting their responsibilities to sharply cut heat-trapping emissions, ensure widespread access to affordable renewable energy, invest in a just phase out of fossil fuels and protect people from the ravages of climate change-fueled disasters. Breaching 1.5 C also has enormous consequences for climate Loss and Damage, as poorer nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis endure a steep toll resulting primarily from richer nations’ failure to adequately curtail their heat-trapping emissions.

“It’s in every nation’s self-interest to limit dangerous climate change and embrace the economic and public health benefits of a clean energy transition—and it’s in the global collective interest. The rest of the world must isolate the Trump administration in its deeply harmful actions and anti-science rhetoric and forge ahead to secure an ambitious global consensus. The time for further delay, zero sum thinking and hiding behind other countries’ inaction is over as the planet teeters on the brink of overshooting 1.5 C of warming.”

Below is a statement by Kate Cell, senior climate campaign manager at UCS and Climate Action Against Disinformation steering committee member and policy working group co-chair.

“This COP’s proposed action agenda is the first to include information integrity as a key objective, creating a critical moment to demand that online search engines and platforms be held to the basic requirements of transparency, safety and accountability that regulate other products. The actions of some of the world’s richest people—leaders from the Big Tech sector—are contributing to climate denial, deception and delay just as leaders of the fossil fuel industry do. In much of the world, billions of daily online queries and interactions are an opportunity for Big Oil to serve dis-informing content with Big Tech’s connivance. As the world faces increasing climate risk, most acutely experienced by the people least responsible for breaching 1.5 C, Big Tech billionaires have proved they are not to be trusted with a livable future for the generations to come. It is past time for systemic solutions to the problem of our polluted information ecosystem.”

Below is a statement by Dr. Astrid Caldas, senior climate scientist for community resilience at UCS.

“The biodiversity impacts of climate change have been multiplying at an alarming rate as wildfires, drought, extreme heat and ocean acidification take a toll on the health of forests, oceans and species globally. Meanwhile, deforestation and changes in land use for agriculture and oil extraction have consequences not only for the environment but for Indigenous and traditional communities that have historically lived off and stewarded the land. Loss of species and other natural resources of cultural significance are undermining these communities’ ability to live in their traditional ways. Action to prevent further warming is essential to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, which in turn helps prevent more future warming. At COP, nations must also commit to well-funded actions to protect forest ecosystems that recognize the rights of Indigenous peoples and directly include their participation in decision-making.”

Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program.
In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees.
Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits.
Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.","For years, those looking to expand Nevada’s film tax credit program have touted their potential to bring jobs, diversify the state’s economy and even provide funding for pre-K programs.

But typically lost in the discussion is the fact that few Nevada film tax credits are used by the film industry at all.

In the more than 10-year history of Nevada’s film tax credit program, more than 98 percent of the credits have been transferred from movie studios to other companies. In total, the state has issued more than $35 million in tax credits, but only about $600,000 have not been transferred.

In Nevada, film tax credits offered by the state are transferrable by law, meaning that studios qualifying for the credits are allowed to sell the credits to other businesses for cash (usually for less than the value of the credits), which can then use them to offset their own tax liability. The three tax types that the credits can be used for are not significant burdens on film companies, which is why they rarely use it themselves.

That structure is not novel — federally, these kinds of credits have been created for projects ranging from clean energy to low-income housing, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Now, Nevada lawmakers could massively expand the film tax credit program by twelve-fold in the upcoming fall special session, prompting concerns from progressive groups and economists opposed to film tax credits that it could functionally serve as a handout to already wealthy corporations and prevent the state from using its dollars on other programs.

“The only purpose to make these tax credits transferable is to launder subsidy payments through other businesses’ tax returns,” said James Hohman, director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a Michigan-based nonprofit that advocates for limited government. “The derogatory term ‘launder’ may seem extreme. That's exactly what is going on in the situation.”

UNR Economics Professor Elliott Parker disagreed with Hohman’s characterization, saying it’s a frequently used tool for economic development, and referred to the transferable structure as more of a “sleight of hand” budgeting maneuver.

“We’re making it look like we're giving them a break on the taxes that they pay,” Parker explained. “But in fact, what we're doing is we're allowing them to make money by selling it to other firms that would have been paying those taxes.”

But he said the proposal to set aside $120 million in tax credits each year for the next 15 years would undoubtedly have an effect on the state’s budget and ability to collect taxes and that’s something lawmakers need to consider.

Proponents of film tax credits have said transferable credits are preferred by governments as a means to attract and sustain economic activity because they do not require a direct cash appropriation to a company, which is prohibited under state law.

David O’Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes — the developer behind the proposed studio project — said the legislation is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” that requires $1.8 billion in investments from companies before they receive the credits, and the whole idea is for the state to meet economic goals and create jobs it wouldn’t get without the tax credits.

“The proposed legislation doesn’t hand out cash — it rewards private investment and local hiring,” O’Reilly said. “These are precisely the kinds of smart, performance-based incentives that will help future-proof Nevada’s economy and keep our most talented residents working here at home.”

How the transferring works

As is the case with Nevada’s existing film tax credit program, the proposal likely to be discussed during the upcoming special session could be used to offset payments related to the state’s insurance premium tax, gaming license fees or modified business tax (which is assessed on payroll).

However, film studios are only subject to the payroll tax, meaning that the credits would likely be sold for cash to gaming or insurance companies to offset their own tax burden.

Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program. That means it could take considerable time for the tax credit to be redeemed in full, according to the film office. The credits must be redeemed within four years of being granted.

It is also standard practice for film production companies to use outside groups to facilitate payroll for their employees, meaning those third parties would be subject to the tax rather than the film production company.

In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees. Credits used for the modified business tax are a distant third.

Notably, the state considers the individual details of these transfers to be confidential, leaving the public in the dark about which companies are buying the tax credits and how much in cash the film studios are receiving in return. Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits. The companies that purchase credits at a discount, however, receive the full face value of the credits off their tax bills — so they effectively get a tax break.

Hohman, who opposed a similar proposal in Michigan, added that the confidentiality of these transactions “is a travesty.”

“People should know who's collecting their taxpayer money,” he said.

What the proposal says

Under the proposal likely to come up in this special session — sponsored by Assms. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) and Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas) — the state starting in 2028 would set aside $120 million in annual transferable tax credits for the industry for the next 15 years, an exponential increase from the existing $10 million annual limit.

Of this pot of money, $95 million would be set aside annually for productions at a yet-to-be-built studio in Las Vegas’ Summerlin community, while the remaining $25 million would be available for productions elsewhere in the state. There’s likely more opportunity for developers to use the tax credits themselves on that larger-scale project.

The base amount of credits that a film production company could receive is 30 percent of all qualified expenses, which can cover anything from set construction to facility leasing. However, that number could be lowered if the company does not hire enough Nevada workers or does not provide sufficient training or work opportunities to underrepresented groups.

An amended version of the bill also put forward new spending requirements for production companies, including investments of $900 million in construction by the end of 2029 and $1.8 billion in capital investment by the end of 2038. If they fail to meet these milestones, the amendment could require a lien be placed against the remaining undeveloped land in an amount equal to the shortfall. Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.

The credits would expire six years after they are issued, an increase from the four-year limit that is in place with the existing program.

Because of this leeway in using the credits, opponents say it could be a pain point for the state budgeting process. If production companies chose to redeem tens of millions of dollars worth of credits in the same year, that would mean less revenue coming into the state, potentially imperiling other initiatives that require state dollars.

“We could see significant [redeeming of credits] during an economic downturn when the state faces its own revenue challenge,” said UNLV economist Michael Brown, the former head of the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/10/70659a9f-studio-union-rally-101525-10.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:58:35.053965

And, while it’s still not too late for many Americans to go solar, contractors in North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona say their 2025 calendars are jammed.

Back in August, EnergySage noted a 205% year-over-year increase in homeowners actively working with solar installers, and observed an all-time high in solar customer inquiries immediately following the passage of the OBBA — a sentiment echoed by installers everywhere.

“When the Big Beautiful Bill passed, and they ended 25d, we signed up like 200 people in a couple weeks,” Bryce Bruncati, director of residential sales at 8MSolar in Raleigh, told WFAE in Charlotte. “So, all solar installers in North Carolina right now are booked through the year.”

In states like Arizona, installers are seeing a similar rush from residents hoping to sneak their systems in under the wire.

“An average system might be around $25,000,” explains Tyler Carlyle, the owner of Bright Home Energy in Phoenix. “You start doing the math, 30% for federal tax credit, $1,000 from state, you’re talking $10,000 in savings by going solar now purchasing the system.”

But more demand means less supply, and running out of solar panels is only one of the issues slowing down lead times, which have been stretching from weeks to months recently, and whether you want to blame that on a lack of federal agents processing imports, a growing trade war limiting the amount of materials contractors can work with, or ongoing the ICE raids that are exacerbating a national construction labor shortage by illegally targeting hardworking Americans because of the color of their skin, the fact remains that many homeowners are eager to lock in the full 30% federal solar tax credit are finding installers short supply, and many installers are scrambling to install systems before the December deadline.

FOMO is real

As we recently discovered, taking advantage of tax credits and saving money are not the primary drivers for home solar adoption among Electrek readers. But while it’s obvious that Electrek readers are objectively better people, that doesn’t mean they don’t like saving money — and the window to do so on a home solar project is rapidly closing.

“Every month you wait puts your incentives at risk,” reads the copy at Florida Power Services. “The permitting process, equipment supply, and installer availability are already creating challenges for homeowners across Pinellas County.”

The site goes on to note that Pinellas County solar installation plan reviews are already delayed more than four weeks, and every week that passes adds to the backlog. “Your system could get stuck in permitting and never make it to installation before incentives expire,” reads the copy. “By starting early, you secure your place in line and give your project the best chance to be completed on time.”

Don’t lose hope, but don’t get stuck

While it may seem like it’s already too late (and, for some of you, it might be), don’t lose hope. Remember that under IRS Form 5695 for systems installed on existing homes, the credit is available in the tax year when the system is “placed in service,” but what exactly that means and whether interconnection or utility “permission to operate” (PTO) is strictly required to meet that “place in service” standard depends on various state and local rulings — and there seems to be plenty of wiggle room in there.

What’s more, I was able to find at least one private-letter IRS ruling said a solar project could qualify as “placed in service” even though utility interconnection (or, “tie-in”) was not yet complete, which could imply that there’s some wiggle room for eligibility baked in at the national level, as well.

As ever, I want to close this one out with a disclaimer and remind you that your favorite journalist (me, obviously) is not an attorney. Especially when it comes to big dollar stuff like this, connect with local experts who do this stuff every day, and maybe consult a tax professional, too, to be on the safe side.

It has a direct influence on construction cost, system sizing, occupant comfort, and building performance and resilience.","The following is a Viewpoint written by Amit Gupta, chief executive at Aeroseal.

As New York prepares to implement its 2026 All-Electric Buildings Act, the transition to clean, efficient electric technologies marks a bold step toward a low-carbon future. Heat pumps and other innovations will redefine how buildings are powered and heated—helping to cut emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Yet, to fully realize the promise of electrification, attention must also be given to something far less visible: air tightness.

Even the most advanced electric heating and cooling systems can only perform at their peak when the building envelope and ductwork are properly sealed. Air leaks dilute efficiency gains, drive up energy costs, and make it harder to deliver the comfort and performance these systems are designed to achieve.

In July, the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council approved the new all-electric standards. When they take effect in 2026, they’ll apply to most new residential buildings seven stories and below and commercial buildings over 100,000 sq ft, expanding in 2029 to include taller residential and smaller commercial buildings.

While the change has been long anticipated—and many in the industry are ready to lead the charge—it brings both opportunities and learning curves. The goal isn’t just compliance; it’s ensuring these buildings are healthy, affordable, and as efficient as possible. Achieving that means pairing electrification with strong air sealing practices so that conditioned air stays where it should, systems run efficiently, and residents enjoy greater comfort.

Professionals across the architect, engineer, and contractor (AEC) community have seen how uncontrolled air leakage can undermine performance—allowing air to move between units or to the outdoors, raising energy use, and forcing oversized mechanical systems. By contrast, sealing those leaks can reduce energy use by more than 30%, enabling smaller, more cost-effective systems that deliver sustained savings and superior comfort.

Electrification is the future of buildings. Air sealing is what ensures that future performs as promised, and the evidence is clear. In a UC Davis-led field demonstration and modeled study of 18 new multifamily homes in Minnesota, aerosol-based envelope sealing resulted in leakage reductions of 67% to 94% and a reduction in heating costs by as much as 25%. Envelope air tightness ranged between 0.2 to 1.4 ACH50, with half of the units exceeding code requirements by more than 80%.

Of course, not all air sealing methods deliver the same results. Traditional hand-applied sealants can be effective, but their reach is limited. Reaching the micro-leaks hidden behind sheathing, framing, or junction boxes is nearly impossible by hand, and once ductwork is behind walls and ceilings, it is completely unattainable without demolition.

Advanced aerosolized sealing technologies can find and seal those leaks automatically, taking the elements of human error and inaccessibility out of the equation. For example, in a U.S. Department of Energy study of 40 residential units in North Carolina, the ductwork in 20 homes was sealed manually and achieved a 59% leakage reduction. The other 20 homes were sealed using Aeroseal’s aerosolized process and achieved a 90% reduction, cutting leakage to roughly 1.5 CFM / 100 ft²—over four-and-a-half times tighter than the manual sealing results of 7.0 CFM/100 ft2. This difference translates directly into smaller, efficient HVAC systems, operating cost savings, and verified performance.

The same dynamic is playing out in projects across the country. On New York’s Upper West Side, progress on the 32-unit 153rd Street Apartments was stalled because the team couldn’t meet Passive House Standard air-tightness requirements—a rigorous, above-code benchmark for building energy efficiency and comfort. Previous manual sealing attempts had been expensive and ineffective. But with advanced envelope air sealing technology, the site sealed all 32 units to the standard in just eight days, enabling the project to move forward.

On a much larger scale, managers of the 600-unit, all-electric Soleil Lofts in Herriman, Utah, wanted to cut energy consumption in half to meet Net Zero performance standards. Units were sealed to 1 ACH50, enabling the use of smaller 1.5-ton VRF heat pumps instead of 3.5-ton gas furnaces. HVAC costs dropped by 50%. And the energy savings made the deployment of rooftop solar economically viable.

Both projects–and hundreds more like them–illustrate a broader truth: air tightness should be treated as a central design and performance factor, not an afterthought. When buildings leak, every other system must work harder. Costs go up. Performance goes down. When buildings are sealed, HVAC loads shrink, renewables become more viable, and residents enjoy lower bills and healthier indoor environments.

As the building industry moves toward all-electric new construction, air tightness should be treated as a core design priority. It has a direct influence on construction cost, system sizing, occupant comfort, and building performance and resilience. For developers, that means recognizing it as an investment that could drive down overall project and long-term operating costs. For the AEC community, it means planning construction timelines and coordination so sealing happens at the right time, leveraging the right technologies to exceed stringent local building standards, emerging code, rigorous certification requirements, and broader performance goals.

For a rapidly evolving industry, the message is clear: the clean-energy transition depends on getting this invisible layer right. By prioritizing advanced sealing techniques, developers and contractors can not only meet New York’s new mandate but also gain an edge in a market that increasingly rewards projects that perform as promised.

Electricity is often channelled to power private utilities, while not delivering on promises of new local jobs. The result is growing public distrust that could derail the energy transition itself.

In Kenya, poor consultation with local communities led to a landmark ruling that revoked the licence for a proposed geothermal project. In India, a 1-gigawatt (GW) solar project funded by the Asian Development Bank was cancelled in 2025 after protests by tribal communities, who reported a lack of proper consultation and faced the displacement of 20,000 people.

In Chile, wind farms built for green hydrogen exports are meeting resistance as residents say such projects threaten ecosystems and livelihoods. In the Philippines, the Tumandok Indigenous people oppose a mega-hydropower project. They say the project risks flooding their ancestral lands and sacred sites, and has violated their right to free, prior and informed consent. And in Pakistan, the 4-GW Dasu Hydropower Project has already uprooted more than 7,000 people, leaving 34 villages abandoned.

With clean energy mega-projects becoming the norm, as shown in a recent report by CAN International, such conflicts are only likely to increase in number unless things change.

Growth without justice

Despite record expansion, deployment of renewables remains far too slow and far too unequal. Many developing countries are constrained by debt and limited fiscal space, while rich nations continue to over-consume energy.

Even where renewables are rising, the benefits often flow to foreign corporations. And power fed back into national grids frequently enriches independent power producers while leaving consumers with high bills.

For Indian women workers, a just transition means surviving climate impacts with dignity

Egypt illustrates the dilemma. To meet its green hydrogen targets and bring in hard currency to service its debt, the country needs to install 41 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and 114 GW by 2040 – five to fifteen times its current renewable capacity. Four percent of Egypt’s land has been designated for green hydrogen production, even as droughts and water scarcity worsen.

Under the EU-led Global Gateway initiative, some of this electricity could be exported to Europe through the GREGY interconnector. Meanwhile, Egypt is becoming a hub for ‘green’ data centres, even as rural areas and public healthcare facilities face rolling blackouts.

“Some of the world’s largest solar projects are in Morocco and Egypt – but they’re built mainly for export, not to meet domestic needs,” says Mohamed Kamal, executive director of Greenish, an Egypt-based civil society organisation. “The real challenge now is governance: how to ensure that new investments serve local people first, especially in regions that still lack the infrastructure for consistent energy supply.”

“As we build the renewable energy economy, we must not repeat the mistakes of the fossil fuel era,” he adds. “We cannot look to those failed models for inspiration or replicate their structures of control within the renewable energy value chain.”

A just transition mechanism for renewables at COP30

At COP30 in Belém, civil society networks including Climate Action Network are calling for the Belém Action Mechanism (BAM) for a Just Transition under the UN climate process to make a fair transition real.

COP30 could confront “glaring gap” in clean energy agenda: mining

BAM would bring together the many initiatives now working in isolation, from practitioner alliances to community projects or programmes led by intergovernmental organisations. This will help countries change course by removing structural barriers such as debt, unfair trade rules and limited technology transfer that keep developing countries at the bottom of renewable supply chains.

It will also unlock public finance to support worker upskilling, green industrial policies and inclusive ownership models and distributed renewable systems. Furthermore, it can create structured dialogue between governments, workers and communities to share best practices, strengthen participation and scale up solutions that deliver.

Such a mechanism could help countries develop not only more renewables, but better ones – people-centred, community-led and domestically owned.

Restoring trust, accelerating transition

Globally, the world is not on track to triple renewable capacity by 2030 – as agreed at COP28 – and fossil fuel emissions remain stubbornly high. Unless the renewable transition becomes fairer, it will also become slower.

From rooftop-solar schemes in India that cut bills and spare land, to initiatives in the Philippines, where a coalition of civil society, faith-based and industry groups has launched a “Ten Million Solar Rooftops” challenge, examples are emerging across the world of what fair, people-centred renewables can look like.

In Canada and Australia, projects led by communities or Indigenous people are showing the same spirit. In Western Australia, the Aalga Goorlil “Sun Turtle” Community Power Project – led by the Djarindjin Aboriginal Corporation – aims to reduce the community’s reliance on non-renewable energy and has already become a symbol of self-determination since the community’s official recognition last year. In Bolivia, solar power is strengthening food and economic security for local farming and fishing communities.

Self-taught mechanics give second life to Jordan’s glut of spent EV batteries

A global just transition mechanism could scale up such efforts, restoring trust and placing equity at the centre of decarbonisation and access to quality energy for everyone.

“Justice isn’t an add-on,” says Mohamed Kamal. “It’s the condition for progress. Without it, the transition won’t hold.” As negotiators prepare for COP30, the question is not only how fast the world can build renewables, but who they are built for and how.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/CHN-pic-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:58:28.176169

When Hurricane Helene devastated Western North Carolina in September of 2024, many of our projects and clients were immediately impacted. In the Town of Burnsville, the hurricane caused a significant infrastructure failure, leaving the town’s water system crippled. Floodwater washed away 2,200 linear feet of influent piping and the raw water pumps supplying the treatment plant. Knowing the critical risks involved with these infrastructure issues, Harper teams mobilized immediately alongside local engineers, trade partners, and town officials.

Harper’s team worked quickly to engineer and install a temporary two-stage diesel pump system, restoring 950 gallons per minute of flow to the treatment plant. This was achieved despite working over steep terrain and through ongoing storm impacts. A second phase added a hybrid electric-diesel backup system, powered by a custom transformer, to adapt the town’s single-phase grid to the three-phase power required for the pumps.

“Coordinating the logistics to reach the location with the necessary equipment and materials was a significant task that required collaboration,” stated Kate Dotten-Holder PE, Charlotte Regional Director. “We are grateful to United Rentals, Cooper Sand and Gravel, and Charles Underwood for their support. It is incredible to have trade partners who were just as eager to help us restore water service.”

Within a week of landfall, clean water was flowing again. Crews also cleared fallen trees, reopened driveways, and delivered food, fuel, and heating supplies to residents.

Loss and Damage The new climate finance target agreed at COP29 did not include L&D as a subgoal.","As climate negotiators, politicians, activists, people of faith, academics, business and more arrive in Belem, the eyes of the world turn to COP30. The stakes are high this year in the face of dynamic geopolitics, extreme weather events, and increasing tensions and conflicts. 10 years after the Paris Agreement was signed, what will the world accomplish in Belem?

ACT Alliance, as a Christian organisation bringing a faith- and rights-based lens to its work and to its analysis of COP, welcomes the Brazilian presidency’s push for COP30 to be the “People’s COP” and in highlighting the ethical considerations of climate change and climate justice through the Global Ethical Stocktake.

Rudelmar Bueno de Faria, general secretary of ACT Alliance says: “The Paris Agreement is catalyzing action towards keeping to the 1.5°C temperature goal, advancing a world that is carbon neutral, and climate resilient development. While this is so, much remains to be done as science points to a potential 1.5°C warming guardrail compromise in a few years. COP 30 must be the moment of truth where faith actors lead an ethical and moral push for more ambition and accountability.”

ACT’s focus at COP30 will be on a range of topics, including finance, mitigation and NDCs, adaptation, loss and damage, gender and just transition.

Finance

Adequate quality climate finance is critical to closing the ambition gap and turning climate commitments into real action on the ground. At COP30, countries must adopt a credible Baku-to-Belém Roadmap to reach the USD 1.3 trillion finance goal agreed at COP29. The Roadmap should speak to relevant actors and highlight relevant reforms to ensure climate finance is high quality and reaches the most vulnerable countries without exacerbating debt, and inequalities

COP30 must underscore the moral imperative and obligation of historic emitters to support vulnerable nations. And the type of finance matters deeply. Grants and concessional finance should form the backbone of climate finance to support vulnerable nations, especially for adaptation and loss and damage action.

Julius Mbatia, global climate justice programme manager with ACT Alliance, says: “Alternative and innovative financing does not replace the legal obligations of developed countries to provide finance to address the climate crisis in developing vulnerable nations. Private financing cannot just flow on its own nor can it replace the role of public finance and interventions. The responsibility of developed countries to provide international public finance must be delivered to bridge the financing gap and mobilize additional quality finance.”

Mitigation and NDCs

The climate crisis is accelerating and continues to hit the most vulnerable communities hardest, especially in regions where ACT Alliance members work. Africa, for example, contributes only 4% of global emissions yet faces some of the most severe climate impacts. Meanwhile, the world’s largest emitters, responsible for about 80% of global emissions, must make deep and rapid cuts.

Current national climate plans (NDCs) are not enough to keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C within reach. According to the 2025 NDC Synthesis Report, countries’ latest pledges would reduce emissions by only 17% by 2035. This is far below the roughly 60% reduction needed to maintain a viable path to 1.5°C.

ACT Alliance will advocate for major emitting countries to treat their current NDC commitments as the baseline, not the ceiling, and to clearly outline how they will increase ambition in the next NDC cycle. Further, the alliance will advocate to remind parties that the implementation of NDCs as commitments cannot set us on the pathway below 1.5 degrees unless they are acted on.

Mattias Söderberg, Global Climate Lead at DanChurchAid, says: “The world is sleepwalking toward a dangerous future. We cannot solve the climate crisis by avoiding its cause. Fossil fuels must be part of the discussion if we are serious about protecting people and the planet.”

Adaptation

For too long, adaptation efforts have been underfunded and overlooked. Nearly half the world’s population already lives in highly climate-vulnerable hotspots, yet progress on financing, planning, and implementation remains far behind.

At COP30, our priorities include boosting support for adaptation through the Baku to Belém Roadmap and ensuring the successful adoption of the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), one of the conference’s key deliverables. GGA indicators to enable transparent, measurable, and globally comparable tracking of adaptation efforts.

Means of Implementation (finance, technology transfer and capacity-building support) is a fundamental inclusion in GGA indicators. Adaptation progress must not be judged solely by national efforts but also by the adequacy of international cooperation and support provided to enable action. ACT Alliance believes that time is right to double down on adaptation support by setting a new and ambitious adaptation finance target beyond 2025

Data must inform action, not create reporting burdens for vulnerable countries. GGA indicators should fundamentally highlight what is already being implemented on the ground, identify where additional support is needed, and highlight gaps where action is insufficient. It should lead in increased action, not just mere reporting.

Loss and Damage

The new climate finance target agreed at COP29 did not include L&D as a subgoal. The COP30 Presidency is not prioritising L&D posing a serious risk to sideline it in future negotiations. The Fund for responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), a UNFCCC fund, is operational but yet to disburse any funds. This is alarming.

The FRLD must be filled and bring justice to the frontline climate impacted people. Its resource mobilisation strategy, which was expected to be adopted by 2025 and delayed now, must be adopted with the objective of ‘escalating’ FRLD’s contribution to responding to loss and damage in the developing countries through contributions from a wide variety of resources of funding, including grants and concessional loans from public, private and innovative sources.

Grants should be prioritised as the primary financial instrument to capitalise and replenish the FRLD, ensuring it meets the scale and pace of needs in the Global South. The FRLD should focus on grant provision only during its start-up phase, with the first disbursements scheduled for 2025–2026 under the Barbados Implementation Mechanism.

Nushrat Chowdhury of Christian Aid says: ‘’It remains disappointing that the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage does not have sufficient funding, pledges are far below the estimated loss and damage needs in developing countries and even the full pledged money has not yet been paid in. Amidst this, the fund is forced to resource mobilize as developed countries push back on providing resources to the fund.’’

Gender

COP29 ended with a decision to extend the Lima Work Program on Gender for an additional ten years. In Bonn, negotiations started to work on the content of the new Gender Action Plan. These negotiations will continue in Belem with a view to adopt a new GAP by the end of the COP30. This new GAP must usher in a new phase in building a climate framework that treats gender equality not merely as a guiding principle, but as a fundamental prerequisite for inclusive, effective, equitable, and transformative climate action.

Elena Cedillo, program executive for climate justice with the Lutheran World Federation, says: ‘’COP30 must send a clear signal for a gender-just climate action, and to explicitly refer to and incorporate key GAP components in NDCs and NAPs, including to collect and use gender-disaggregated data and to use gender markers, and gender budgeting.”

Just transition

Building on the outcomes of the GST in 2023, COP30 must continue to emphasise the need for a fair and equitable phase-out of fossil fuels. Simply including fossil fuel language in the final text is not enough. What is needed is a commitment to justice in the energy transition, balancing responsibility and capability, and on fostering real economic transformation. The world’s largest emitters, primarily the richest countries, must lead by reducing emissions drastically by 2035, and achieving net-zero by 2050, and providing support to middle-income countries to follow soon after. Poorer nations should transition at a pace aligned with their capacities and national circumstances, receiving full financial, technical, and capacity-building support to decarbonize their economies and implement NDCs while ensuring access to clean energy and poverty eradication in their countries.

ACT Alliance members will advocate for elimination of fossil-fuels subsidies and fossil fuel phase-out pathways that go hand-in-hand with the Just transition principles. At COP30,The JTWP must champion people-oriented and rights-based transition pathways and Developed countries must commit to investing in and expanding energy access through decentralised renewable energy systems that create local jobs, empower women and youth, and deliver clean power to off-grid communities. Public finance should take the lead in driving this transition to prevent the accumulation of unsustainable debt, and these commitments must be firmly embedded within the Baku to Belém Roadmap.",https://actalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSCF5605-700x467.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 11:58:37.101400

Delegates from over 190 countries, NGOs, Indigenous representatives, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, alongside COP President André Corrêa do Lago, will all participate in this year's high-stakes climate negotiations.

Missed Targets and Weak Ambition: It's Now or Never

With 2024 confirmed as the hottest year ever on record, the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and the massive financial shortfalls left by lackluster negotiations at COP29, this year's climate talks are pivotal.

A 2024 report by the UN revealed that current policies put the planet on track to reach a catastrophic 3.1°C warming by 2100 (Emissions Gap Report). This scenario would expose 600 million people to flooding, reduce food yields by half, cause severe water shortages, lead to insurmountable habitat and biodiversity loss, create month-long brutal heatwaves and wildfires, heighten the risks of insect-borne diseases, and profoundly deepen inequalities.

Progress will be stalled unless the global climate investment gap can be closed and pledges are finally turned into real investments.

At last year's summit, it was agreed that at least $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance would be mobilized for developing countries by 2035. This funding is intended to support a just transition to clean energy, climate adaptation policies, and addressing loss and damage from climate change.

Tackling the climate crisis is IMPOSSIBLE without adequate funding. Since President Donald Trump took office, at least $18 billion has been stripped from climate finance—6% of the new global $300 billion annual target. The current pace of financing is entirely insufficient to meet the agreed-upon goals.

At COP30, all members of the UNCCC are expected to publish their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outlining their national plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate impacts.

The NDC Synthesis Report was released in October 2025, which, according to Melanie Robinson, global climate, economics, and finance program director for World Resources Institute, ""lays bare a frightening gap between what governments have promised and what is needed to protect people and planet.""

Progress will be stalled unless the global climate investment gap can be closed and pledges are finally turned into real investments. This will prove even more difficult as militarization grips the planet. NATO has increased its spending commitments to an unprecedented 5% of GDP, and the EU Special Debts for Rearmament will further siphon money into warmongering, posturing, and weapons stockpiling.

A new initiative, the Global Ethical Stocktake, launched by the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva, and the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, aims to integrate ethical considerations into climate negotiations, an aspect that has previously been omitted.

Jaded by a lack of action in previous COPs, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, along with other influential figures such as Mary Robinson and Christiana Figueres, labelled the current climate policy process ""no longer fit for purpose.""

Finally, a COP President with Credentials: André Corrêa do Lago

This year's COP president holds higher hopes than others. He is a veteran climate diplomat and serves as the current secretary for climate, energy, and environment at the Brazilian Ministry of External Affairs.

He has worked with Brazil's diplomatic corps since 1982 and has represented Brazil in similar negotiations, including as chief negotiator at Rio+20, COP28, and COP29.

In a positive initial call to action, he has called on all stakeholders in the climate negotiations process to ""act decisively in the face of climate urgency through an ambitious and integrated Action Agenda at COP30.""

A COP Built on Deforestation: Brazil Controversy

The location of this year's climate summit is highly contentious. Destroying thousands of acres of rainforest to make way for a new four-lane highway, which is intended to ease congestion for COP visitors, is a blatant contradiction. This is the very environment Brazil has pledged to protect.

Rather than addressing the concerns, classic greenwashing terms like 'sustainable"" are being used to describe the 8-mile road. Cutting through the Amazon rainforest, the road will fragment the ecosystem, disrupt the movement of wildlife, affect the livelihoods of local communities, and be inaccessible to those who live on either side of the highway. It will, however, have bike lanes and solar-powered lights!

The lack of infrastructure in the area means that more than 30 large-scale construction projects will be taking place to accommodate and prepare for the 50,000 expected visitors. The port is being redeveloped for cruise ships, and $81 million will be spent on expanding the airport to double its current capacity.

Emissions, emissions, emissions!

The expansion of the fossil fuel industry seriously contradicts the Brazilian government's climate narrative and threatens the country's credibility at COP30.

After three climate conferences in countries with restrictions on protests, Amazonian leaders and social movements are wary that their participation may be discounted and silenced. Since February, Indigenous groups have been occupying the Secretary of Education and blocking roads that cut through their territories. The protests have already begun.

Brazil is also no climate leader, but rather an empire built on oil. Its vast mining, fossil fuel, and agribusiness sectors mean that Brazil is responsible for more than 4% of total global emissions. In 2023, it emitted 2.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases, making Brazil the world's fifth worst polluter.

In this country of deep inequalities, the poor are disproportionately affected by climate change, including sea-level rise; heatwaves; and heavy, erratic rainfalls.

Just weeks before the conference begins, a new bill to dismantle Brazil's environmental license framework was passed. It eases restrictions on oil exploration and road development in the Amazon. A self-licensing process enables fossil fuel and construction companies to act with impunity and avoid the need for impact studies and mitigation measures.

Immediately after the bill change, Petrobras, the country's majority state-owned, scandal-ridden oil company, began drilling for oil a mere 200 miles away from Belém. The license was previously denied due to the risk of widespread biodiversity loss in this fragile ecosystem in the event of a spill. A new report reveals that since 2024, big banks have provided $2 billion in new financing for oil and gas in the Amazon.

Estimates suggest that up to 60 billion barrels of oil may exist in the Brazilian Amazon. If burned, they could emit 24 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide—more than Brazil's emissions over the past 11 years. The expansion of the fossil fuel industry seriously contradicts the Brazilian government's climate narrative and threatens the country's credibility at COP30.

Key vesting targets emphasize Full Self-Driving software, Robotaxi networks, Optimus humanoid robots, and Megapack energy storage, projecting trillions in value from high-margin, non-automotive innovations.

With strong shareholder approval, the package underscores investor belief in Tesla as a Silicon Valley disruptor, eclipsing traditional automakers and aiming for a $10 trillion enterprise by 2035.

In a move that underscores the audacious ambitions of one of the world’s most polarizing CEOs, Tesla (TSLA) shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a compensation package for Elon Musk potentially worth $1 trillion, vesting over the next decade if the company meets a series of escalating performance milestones. This isn’t merely a reward for steering Tesla through its electric vehicle dominance; it’s a resounding endorsement of the company’s pivot from a car manufacturer to a multifaceted technology powerhouse, betting everything on artificial intelligence, robotics, and energy innovation. At a time when Tesla’s automotive sales face intensifying competition from legacy automakers and Chinese rivals, this package crystallizes the investor conviction that the firm’s future valuation – projected to balloon into the trillions – lies in disruptive tech ecosystems, not assembly lines.

The sheer magnitude of the deal speaks volumes. Structured as 12 tranches of stock options, the package could grant Musk up to 25% of Tesla’s equity, or roughly 423.7 million shares, contingent on hitting targets that propel the company’s market cap from its current $1.43T/$432.03 levels toward unprecedented heights. Unlike traditional CEO pay tied to quarterly earnings or unit sales, Musk’s incentives are calibrated for exponential growth: revenue thresholds in the hundreds of billions, production ramps for non-vehicle products, and operational benchmarks in AI deployment. For context, his previous 2018 package – once the largest in history at $56 billion – fueled Tesla’s EV surge but fell short of fully capturing the robotics and autonomy visions. This new iteration escalates the stakes, requiring Tesla to grow by trillions in enterprise value, a feat unattainable through cars alone, where global EV penetration is projected to plateau below 50% by 2030 according to industry forecasts.

Central to this transformation is Tesla’s aggressive foray into AI and autonomy. The pay package’s milestones explicitly hinge on advancements in Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and the Robotaxi network, which Musk has positioned as the company’s “next big thing.” With FSD subscriptions already generating recurring revenue – outpacing hardware sales in some quarters – these technologies promise a software-like margin profile, potentially 90% gross margins versus the 20-30% from vehicles. Investors aren’t rewarding Musk for building more Model Ys; they’re compensating him for orchestrating a fleet of millions of autonomous vehicles that could monetize through ride-hailing, data licensing, and even urban planning integrations. Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer, designed to train AI models on petabytes of real-world driving data, further cements this shift, positioning the company as a direct competitor to Nvidia (NVDA) in AI hardware.

Robotics amplifies the signal. The Optimus humanoid robot, unveiled as a factory worker but eyed for consumer applications, represents Tesla’s bid to capture the $10 trillion labor automation market by 2040. Package vesting requires scaling Optimus production to thousands of units annually, integrating it with Tesla’s AI stack for tasks from warehouse logistics to household assistance. This isn’t ancillary; Musk has stated that robotics could eclipse automotive revenue within five years, a claim now baked into his trillion-dollar upside. Energy storage rounds out the triad: Megapack deployments for grid-scale batteries have already hit record deployments in 2025, with milestones demanding gigawatt-hour outputs that rival entire national power sectors. These segments – AI, bots, energy – collectively drove 40% of Tesla’s valuation premium in recent analyst models, far outstripping its 2 million annual vehicle deliveries.

Critics may decry the package as executive excess, especially amid Tesla’s recent profit dips from price wars. Yet, with 75% shareholder approval, the vote reflects a calculated risk: Musk’s track record of defying odds, from reusable rockets to neural interfaces, justifies aligning his wealth to Tesla’s moonshot aspirations. Traditional automakers like Ford (F) or GM (GM) cap CEO pay at $20 – 30 million annually, tethered to finite markets. Tesla’s board, by contrast, has engineered a mechanism that vests fully only if the company transcends Detroit’s playbook, achieving 25% founder control to ward off activist dilution.

By 2035, when the package matures, Tesla could command a $10 trillion enterprise if these bets pay off – dwarfing Apple’s (AAPL) current scale through a constellation of AI-driven services. The $1 trillion payout isn’t hubris; it’s a litmus test for Tesla’s reinvention. Gone are the days of it being “just a car company.” This is the compensation architecture of a Silicon Valley titan, rewarding the architect of tomorrow’s intelligent economy. Investors, it seems, are all in.

Covering Katy News was first to report in March that Tesla was locating its Megapack battery manufacturing facility in Brookshire after Waller County Commissioners Court and the Brookshire City Council approved tax abatement agreements.

The Waller County Commissioners Court approved the tax abatement agreement on Wednesday, March 5, followed by the Brookshire City Council's approval on Thursday, March 6.

Tesla Plans 1,500 Jobs by 2028 in Waller County

Tesla has committed to employing at least 375 people at the facility in Empire West Business Park by the end of 2026, according to the company's tax abatement agreement with Waller County Commissioners Court. That figure increases to at least 750 by the end of 2027 and at least 1,500 by the end of 2028. Tesla must maintain at least 1,500 employees through the remainder of the 10-year abatement period, which begins Jan. 1, 2026.

The Austin-based electric vehicle manufacturer expects to pay more than $1 billion in employee salaries over the 10-year period.

What Tesla Will Manufacture in Brookshire

The Empire West industrial park is located on Woods Road between Highway 90 and Interstate 10, a short distance from Katy.

During a March commissioners court meeting, a Tesla representative said the company plans to replicate its Lathrop, California, facility, which manufactures utility-scale batteries called Megapacks. The California facility produces 10,000 Megapacks annually, equal to 40 gigawatt hours of energy storage.

Tesla Megapacks are used to store electricity for large renewable energy projects which are not consistent producers of power. Solar does not produce energy at night when it's dark, and wind energy does not produce electricity when the wind isn't blowing and the turbines aren't spinning. Tesla's Megapacks store power for use during times when renewable energy sources aren't generating electricity.

Tesla's $200 Million Investment in Empire West Business Park

Tesla will lease two buildings in Empire West Business Park, which is being developed by Dallas-based Stream Realty Partners. The company leased the 1.04 million-square-foot Building 9 in 2022, though a third party was occupying the building as of March.

Under the tax abatement agreement, Tesla will spend $44 million on improvements to Building 9, located at 111 Empire Blvd., and approximately $150 million on manufacturing equipment including automated robotic welding cells, robotic assembly stations, automatic conveyors and gantry trains.

Tesla also plans to lease Building 10, which has not yet been constructed. The 616,463-square-foot building will be located at 103 Empire Blvd. Stream will spend $31.5 million on improvements to Building 10, while Tesla plans to spend approximately $5 million on warehouse equipment.

Tax Abatement Agreement Details

Tesla will receive tax abatements of 60% on the value of the improvements and buildings from both Waller County and the city of Brookshire.

""This is another excellent example of our spec building program, which has been used by Waller County since 2010 to attract new investment to the area,"" Yokom said. ""Brookshire also implemented a similar program for Stream Realty to expand Empire West.""

Stream Realty built the so-called ""spec"" building at its Empire West business park with no tenant on speculation that it would attract jobs and economic development. Stream will also oversee the construction of the new 600,000-square-foot distribution facility with some manufacturing capabilities. When completed, Tesla will occupy both buildings.

The deal has been developing for months, but Tesla has held the lease on the building since October 2021 where third-party logistics company DB Schenker handled Tesla parts. Schenker will be moving out, and Tesla will be moving into that building which will be used to manufacture Tesla's Megapacks.

This expansion follows Tesla's headquarters relocation from California to Texas in December 2021, after opening its 4 million-plus-square-foot Gigafactory in Austin.

Brookshire Emerging as Clean Energy Manufacturing Hub

The Brookshire area has attracted several clean energy manufacturing operations recently. TMEIC Corp. Americas broke ground this year on its third manufacturing facility in Brookshire, a 267,000-square-foot plant on a 20-acre site that will produce uninterruptible-power supplies and medium-voltage drives.

Turkey-based solar manufacturer Elin Energy moved into a 225,000-square-foot facility in Twinwood Business Park, and international water pump manufacturer Grundfos is more than doubling its production capacity in Brookshire. Indian solar panel manufacturer Waaree also has a presence in Waller County near Brookshire.

""This was a great partnership effort between Waller County and the city of Brookshire. I want to thank Joe Esch, who represented Brookshire and currently oversees the city's economic development program.

Now, environmentalists claim, Senate Republicans are refusing to act on a budget as schools and social programs desperately wait for state funding until Shapiro and Democratic lawmakers agree to repeal the regulations entering Pennsylvania into RGGI.

""As the governor himself has often said, this is a false choice between a healthy environment and our economy, and now our environmental champions in Harrisburg, many of whom are standing behind me today, must resist,"" Molly Parzens, executive director of Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Thursday.

A spokesperson for Shapiro said Thursday his office would not comment on budget negotiations. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman's (R-Indiana) office did not respond to a request for comment.

RGGI aims to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by requiring the companies that own them to invest in clean energy projects. The multi-state program has been in place in about a dozen mid-Atlantic and northeastern states for more than a decade.

It has cut carbon emissions from power plants in half by placing an enforceable declining cap on the amount of climate pollution that fossil fuel power plants are allowed to emit. Participating states have seen more than $9 billion in investments and it's projected that consumers will save $20 billion in energy costs as a result.

Former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf entered Pennsylvania into the program in 2019 by executive order. Republicans, who controlled both chambers of the General Assembly at the time, argued it infringed on their legislative authority and argued it amounts to an illegal tax on energy.

The state Supreme Court heard arguments last May from the Shapiro administration that controlling carbon emissions is within the state Department of Environmental Protection's broad authority to control air pollution. Lawyers for Senate Republicans said the regulations encroach into policy decisions about the state's energy economy that are the domain of lawmakers, not the executive branch.

A decision in the case could come at any time.

Robert Routh, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said at the news conference in Philadelphia that withdrawing from RGGI before the court's decision would be shortsighted, as the decision will not abrogate the administration's ability to regulate emissions.

""Regardless of how the court rules, the Supreme Court decision will affect how Pennsylvania can design rules to control climate pollution under the Air Pollution Control Act, not whether the state can do so,"" Routh said.

""And there is, of course, the possibility that the court finds in favor of RGGI, upholds the constitutionality of the rule as currently designed, and delivers a massive victory for Pennsylvanians that will lower costs, cut pollution and create jobs,"" Routh said. ""I urge people to recognize that giving away this possibility at the goal line would be a costly mistake.""

On the 100th day of the impasse last month, House Minority Leader Jesse Topper, R-Bedford, told reporters that budget discussions were outside the realm of economic reality in Pennsylvania. GOP lawmakers have objected to Shapiro's proposal to spend down the state's budget surplus and dip into its $7 billion rainy day fund, arguing that doing so ignores a structural deficit.

To avoid that, the state needs sustained economic growth, and Topper argued the way to achieve that is by unleashing Pennsylvania's fossil fuel resources.

""What we have underneath our feet in terms of natural resources would make any state in the union green with envy, and yet we continue to miss our opportunities,"" Topper said, arguing that RGGI is the cause of instability in the state's energy markets.

""We have to get out of RGGI once and for all,"" he said, noting House Republicans planned to file a discharge motion to force a floor vote on the Senate's bill to repeal RGGI regulations.

The same day, House Democrats ratched up pressure on Senate GOP leaders before passing a $50.6 billion spending plan, in a response to the Senate's flat funding proposal in July. Majority Leader Matt Bradford, D-Montgomery, told reporters that Democrats were willing to compromise on ""every single issue.""

""There are 102 Democrats that would be heartbroken by almost every one of those compromises, but we will do them because government must be open and it must work,"" Bradford said.

Asked whether the openness to compromise extended to the Senate RGGI bill, Bradford acknowledged two areas where his caucus would not budget. One, he said, was taxpayer funded private school tuition vouchers.

The other: ""No, we're not getting out of RGGI without taking care of our environment, period full stop.""",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/pennsylvania_climate_budget.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 11:58:42.438984

New York Governor Kathy Hochul finally relented and on Friday handed a major award for Tulsa-based Williams Cos.to see light at the end of the day as it seeks approval for a 24-mile pipeline to supply New York City with natural gas.

She signed a permit advancing the the Northeast Supply Enhancement line, a total reversal of her previous rejections of the project. Williams had previously been denied twice its requests for approval of the line. The company secured what are known as Clean Water Action 401 and 404 permits from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and a Section 401 Water Quality Certification and related permits from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

“We’re proud to move NESE forward and do our part in providing New Yorkers access to clean, reliable and affordable natural gas,” said Chad Zamarin, president and CEO of Williams. “This project reflects our commitment to deliver clean and reliable energy, while lowering energy costs and supporting economic growth and environmental stewardship.”

“As Governor, a top priority is making sure the lights and heat stay on for all New Yorkers as we face potential energy shortages downstate as soon as next summer,” Hochul said in a statement, according to multiple reports. “We need to govern in reality. We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.”

The NESE project is designed to improve energy affordability and reliability in New York City by expanding access to critical natural gas infrastructure and displacing high-emitting and costly fuel oil, which is delivered into New York City by diesel trucks. NESE will enhance energy security, lower costs, and reduce emissions, and the project is expected to generate over $1 billion in investment, create thousands of construction-related jobs, and deliver long-term benefits to New York residents and commercial energy users.

In parallel, Williams continues to advance the Constitution Pipeline project, a pipeline in upstate New York that will serve markets in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Maine. The company has withdrawn its current water permit application with NYSDEC and is preparing to follow up with additional filings to ensure that this critical infrastructure project obtains the regulatory approvals needed for construction and operation.

“There is increasing recognition that energy affordability directly impacts everyday affordability,” said Zamarin. “Natural gas is one of our nation’s lowest-cost resources, with U.S. natural gas produced at a cost equivalent to less than 50 cents per gallon of gasoline. Expanding natural gas infrastructure is vital to lowering costs and increasing economic opportunity, and the NESE and Constitution projects are important to connecting energy to opportunity in the Northeast.”

The NESE project is designed to meet market needs of New York, providing $1.8 billion in economic development, delivering gas to 2.3 million homes, and reducing CO2 emissions by over 13,000 tons per year; equivalent to removing 2,800 cars from the road each year. NESE also supports over 3,000 jobs and generates millions in gross state product (GSP) and state tax revenues for the state. During the construction phase of the project, the state of New Jersey will experience an increase in economic activity, including direct and indirect job creation and an increase in state and local tax revenue.

Constitution is designed to provide low-cost, low-emissions energy supply to the Northeast to support economic growth and energy affordability across the region. According to a new S&P Global study, Constitution would generate up to $11.6 Billion in total savings by lowering natural gas prices in the Northeast and support nearly 2,000 jobs annually over a 15-year period. The study also finds that energy savings from the pipeline could stimulate up to $4.4 billion in additional GSP across Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island and could generate $432 million in federal and state tax revenues.

The project has been hotly contested by some Congressional New York Democrats, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and others urging Hochul to consider the environmental impacts of the pipeline on Oct. 15.

Hochul’s decision to finally approve the line came after President Trump bashed her over a delay on the permits.

“Governor Kathy Hochul of New York State is killing the entire region with Energy Prices that are OUT OF CONTROL, and expected to TRIPLE because she can’t get an Upstate and, separately, Long Island, PIPELINE built,” Trump wrote last week on Truth Social.",,N,,2025-11-09 11:58:50.064384

Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.
“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England.","The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.

Earth’s warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.

There’s been progress — more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 — but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.

“I think it’s important that we’re honest with the world and we declare failure,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming’s harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.

But diplomats aren’t giving up.

“We’re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.

But the speed of humanity’s climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate’s harms, she said, adding that means that “the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.”

U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is “obviously falling behind.”

“We’re sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,” she said.

Danger signs

The planet’s annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.

Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia’s Siberia.

Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.

Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan,China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.

Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world’s glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That’s the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.

Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world’s seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it’s enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.

Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.

Success in bending the curve

But there’s also a lot that officials celebrate in the past 10 years.

Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.

“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. “You cannot hold back the tides.”

In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.

But that’s nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement’s overarching goal.

“Ten years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,” Rockstrom said. “Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.”

A report examining dozens of indicators of progress — such as solar and wind power installations — in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.

The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.

“Technologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,” said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. “But it’s not nearly fast enough for what’s needed.”

Pollution keeps growing

Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.

Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China’s going up 15.5% and India’s soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.

Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.

“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. “Unfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can’t say it’s failed. But then nor can you say it’s dramatically succeeded.”

That's the bad news. Is there any good news?

It's easier to get politicians to say yes to clean energy than no to dirty energy.

Albemarle Corp. is reducing its exposure to the refining catalyst business as the world’s biggest lithium producer looks to cut debt and generate cash at a time of persistently low prices of the key battery metal.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm agreed to sell a controlling stake in Ketjen Corp.’s refining catalyst solutions business to private equity firm KPS Capital Partners LP, according to a statement Monday. Separately, Albemarle will sell its 50% interest in the Eurecat joint venture to Axens SA.

The transactions are expected to generate proceeds of about $660 million for Albemarle to reduce debt and other general corporate purposes at a time when its main industry, lithium, is grappling with a lingering oversupply that has squeezed margins and seen producers cut back.

Albemarle will retain 49% of the Ketjen refining catalyst business and full ownership of Ketjen’s performance catalyst business, including a plant in Pasadena, Texas. Goldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial adviser and K&L Gates LLP is acting as legal adviser on both transactions for Albemarle. They’re expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

Eurecat focuses on the regeneration of spent catalysts, and services around catalysts in refining and petrochemicals.

But if it is more expensive than cleaner alternatives, its share of the electricity mix will decline on its own.
This approach will end the volatile pendulum that has characterized coal policy (and energy policy as a whole) over the past decades.
While punitive rules on coal should be repealed, reasonable regulations can still play an important role in coal policy.
By 2021, coal plants' mercury emissions were about 90 percent lower than pre-MATS level along with significant reductions from other hazardous air pollutants.","Policymakers shaping America's coal policy can learn something important from the 2025 economics Nobel Prize winners about creative destruction, the process by which new technologies replace older ones through innovation. Just as smartphones overtook flip phones and cars displaced horses, such progress has improved our daily lives.

Instead of government subsidizing or transitioning away from coal, America should let companies develop new energy technologies that can freely compete with -- and potentially replace -- coal energy to power homes and businesses.

This obvious concept should be universally welcomed. If coal is reliable and affordable, it will continue to power our grid. But if it is more expensive than cleaner alternatives, its share of the electricity mix will decline on its own.

This approach will end the volatile pendulum that has characterized coal policy (and energy policy as a whole) over the past decades. The same government levers used to wage war on coal, along with other fossil fuel energy sources, are then used to subsidize them when political leadership changes.

While allocating trillion-dollar subsidies to preferred green energy industries, the Biden administration tried to eliminate coal through punitive regulations such as the requirement for coal plants to capture 90 percent of their carbon emissions by 2032. This impossible standard would have forced nearly all coal plants into retirement.

The Trump administration was correct to propose repealing these burdensome rules and open 13 million acres of federal land for coal development. But it went further by providing $625 million in subsidies for coal plants, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provided a tax subsidy for metallurgical coal.

Though the subsidies are not long-term solutions, Trump's actions were understandable responses to New Green Deal proponents who attempted to phase out fossil fuel while subsidizing wind and solar, destabilizing the grid. Many U.S. regions are at ""elevated risk,"" which means that electricity shortfall can occur in extreme conditions, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Washington can put an end to this partisan battle over coal by embracing this approach rooted in creative destruction, free of subsidies and excessive regulations.

While punitive rules on coal should be repealed, reasonable regulations can still play an important role in coal policy. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency's 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule protects the environment. By 2021, coal plants' mercury emissions were about 90 percent lower than pre-MATS level along with significant reductions from other hazardous air pollutants.

Policymakers could also remove government barriers that hinder other energy sources from competing freely with coal. For example, rather than blocking permits for natural gas pipelines that deliver cleaner fuel, states could approve such projects. New York can cooperate with the Trump administration to advance the 125-mile Constitutional and 37-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement pipelines that were previously rejected. Other projects such as transmission line expansions and power plants should be able to advance under an efficient permitting process.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled back many green energy tax credits, but the legislation failed to repeal completely the clean electricity credits that drive renewable deployment. Congress should complete the task of repealing all energy subsidies.

Meanwhile, competition between energy producers will determine coal's role in the power mix. If emerging technologies like large-scale battery systems outperform coal, its decline simply means that America has found better ways to power homes and businesses. This possible scenario may lead to job losses in the coal industry, but it also creates new opportunities in innovative energy sectors.

Coal continues to have an important place in our energy mix domestically and globally. It provides 15 percent of total American electricity generation. Globally, coal has been the leading source of electricity production for over 50 years. Its instrumental role in energy supply and economic progress in the past and present may not continue, but its future should be determined not by government but by competition.

Senate Republicans will likely support this approach, but energy affordability and reliability should not be partisan concerns.
Affordable, reliable, and clean energy should be an issue that unites us at a time when unity is in short supply.","While the House of Representatives has understandably been quiet during the government shutdown, not everyone has been idle.

While most members of Congress were home in their districts, Rep. Troy Balderson, an Ohio Republican, quietly introduced a short, potentially consequential piece of energy legislation called ""The Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act.""

""We the People"" will celebrate our nations 250th birthday next Independence Day. And truth be told, we are crossing this milestone birthday showing our age. We are politically bipolar. We are in debt. Our infrastructure is crumbling and our schools are a mess. We are in need of several new leases on life.

For starters, if America is to be made great again - by anyones definition - it will require a commonsense reordering of our approach to energy and electricity generation. Troy Baldersons approach offers the kind of clear-eyed vision we need.

Aimed as a corrective to the ""Green New Deal"" priorities that took hold during the Biden administration, the ARC would direct federal agencies to reorder their policies with attainable objectives aimed at increasing attainable and cost-effective domestic energy production - and providing benchmarks allowing for effective congressional oversight.

The bill would formally require government regulators to prioritize these three words when evaluating energy projects: Is it affordable? Is it reliable? Is it clean? Most politicians give lip-service to these concepts, but under current law they are left open to interpretation by the executive branch and they shift from one administration to the next, Balderson points out. His bill would essentially codify a true ""all of the above"" energy approach - and would benefit all Americans regardless of their ideological leanings.

If enacted by Congress and signed by the president, his legislation would require the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency to submit a report to Congress within 180 days documenting what they are doing to incorporate all-of-the-above into our national energy strategy. Windmills and solar farms wouldnt be suddenly sidelined. (On the other end of the energy scale, neither would coal.) But this bill would virtually assure that all viable, affordable, and reliable energy sources - including nuclear power and natural gas - remain in the nations energy mix. In other words, it replaces old habits and ideological fads with practicality as a way of supporting American families and businesses.

I dont question liberals commitment to a cleaner environment. But Democrats campaigned this autumn on the need for ""affordability"" - and found a receptive electorate. This legislation would turn that rhetoric into action. And just as important to poor and middle-class families, it fuels our nations efforts to rebuild and onshore the energy sector that fuels economic growth.

Greater reliance on natural gas and nuclear power will deliver green and clean dividends. ARC is a win, win, win. The status quo is a lose, lose, lose.

Mine is a nonpartisan appeal for making this bill law. Legislators of America, lets meet in the middle of the aisle. Without the re-ordering of energy interests in this bill - affordability first, reliability second, and clean third - our rate cards are going to go through the roof. The economy, the hopes of the American people, and their pursuit of happiness are predicated on considerably lower rates.

The American ratepayer is the American family. And ""We the People"" - the payers - are suffering unnecessarily, and it is not by the hand of foreign actors beyond our democratic reach and control. It is being done by those who are supposed to represent us.

My fellow Americans, lend me your ears for an ADHD minute. In the recent past, we have been governed by a shackling set of priorities. Clean energy has been in the driver seat, followed by affordability, and then reliability. This ""CAR"" approach has not delivered on its promises. And it is structurally incapable of getting us over the fast-approaching AI demand hill.

The status quo CAR approach and mindset cant even service the status quo. Look no further than New Jersey, which is having a voter revolt partly because of rising electricity costs. This is not a only a blue state problem. Georgia sent an affordability message last Tuesday that should be a wake-up call for all red states, which like Texas have chased green subsidies. The rate increases are coming due for all.

If we continue to follow our current energy priorities, brown-outs, economic stagnation, and out-migration to energy-rich states will follow. ""We the People"" will all benefit from the passage of ARC Energy Security. Democrats, Republicans, and independent voters will all benefit.

What is our short-term future if we do nothing new? Take your present energy bill and multiply it by 2.3, which is the variance between American and British ratepayers in the business sector.

New Jersey, whats the mid-term future of sticking with CAR? Give your present rate card woes about a 100% increase. This is what German ratepayers are gouged for - around 40 cents per kilowatt hour - to underwrite their countrys march towards deindustrialization.

Texas and Florida - states with lower energy costs and the beneficiaries of out-migration from blue states that have gone green crazy - deduct money from your energy bill and think about what that money can do in the hands of citizens spending it in your state, and investing for retirement.

AIs appetite for reliable energy will require an energy-capacity building boom. The ARC approach will get us there; CAR will not. John Fetterman, Congressman Balderson needs a co-sponsor in the Senate. Senate Republicans will likely support this approach, but energy affordability and reliability should not be partisan concerns.

In the second Trump administration, the president has issued various executive orders, and Cabinet secretaries have put out their directives while incoming Democratic governor Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility costs. Theres a better way to govern - a better way to promote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

Affordable, reliable, and clean energy should be an issue that unites us at a time when unity is in short supply.

As electricity became more available, we saw a steady rise in standard of living across America.

In summer driving to the coast in our 1955 Buick Special for a week on the beach was to me like being in heaven. Life was good and getting better.

As demand for more energy grew in the 1970s, there was much debate about filling future US energy needs. Historically, electricity generation was mostly coal, hydro and natural gas. Concern for the environment was also on the rise. As part of these concerns, nuclear power plants were being built across the country.

At this same time, Amory Lovins, an American physicist, said the world was now at an energy crossroads. Either we continue with fossil fuels and nuclear, both of which he said had “serious environmental risks” or adopt a “soft energy path” comprised mainly of wind and solar. Though unproven, he convinced many that the future was the soft energy path.

In 1976 President Jimmie Carter came out against nuclear and had solar panels installed on the Whitehouse. Later, the Obama administration defunded (undoubtedly for political reasons) construction of the Yucca Mountain used nuclear fuel storage facility. This extended the hiatus in further nuclear development and use to over fifty years.

In 1988 James Hansen, a NASA scientist, made a presentation to the U.S. Senate that implied global warming was occurring due to a slight continuing increase (about 2 ppm/yr.) in anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. Data suggested that warming was now occurring at a rate of about 1 degree Celsius increase every 100 years.

John Kerry and the UN spent the next 30 years highlighting this as an immediate crisis and existential threat. Their proposed solution? Reduce CO2 by killing use of coal, oil, natural gas and replacing with wind and solar electricity.

This has been the path for 50 years, although after spending trillions of dollars, CO2 continues to rise about 2-3 ppm per year. This approach has also always ignored the elephant in the room with wind and solar: that they are intermittent, non-dispatchable and have very low-capacity factors. We also continue to spend millions of dollars pursuing hydrogen, fusion and geothermal, all of which have major technical limitations that likewise get ignored.

Natural gas and nuclear power are both proven and will reduce CO2 emissions, given nonetheless that the slow rise in CO2 above today’s 427 ppm is neither a crisis nor an emergency.

So, here we are in 2025 at another energy crossroad. Looking back on 50 years of history, it seems hard to me to not conclude that killing nuclear and pursuing the soft energy path was a mistake. With natural gas and nuclear we can for the foreseeable future produce clean, affordable, abundant, on-demand electricity critical to maintaining an acceptable standard of living in middle America.",https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/qyxjoi/picture306933066/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Energy%20Northwest%20morning%20light,N,,2025-11-09 11:21:25.939887

Liheap helps struggling households keep their heat and lights on by helping eligible families pay their utility bills.
Under normal circumstances, states would already have received Liheap funding.
However, because of the shutdown, most states are operating using limited carryover funds from last year’s budget or support from state emergency dollars.
States spend roughly 80% of Liheap funds during the winter months, when heating costs are highest.","As the stalemate over government funding and healthcare benefits continues, winter is approaching – but federal heating assistance, blocked by the shutdown, isn’t arriving in time. Millions of American families are about to face an impossible choice: heating their homes or putting food on the table. As the senator for a state known for its volatile winters and as executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, we call on states and utilities to choose a different outcome for those families and shut off the shutoffs. A nationwide freeze on utilities’ ability to disconnect customers from heat for nonpayment isn’t about politics – it’s about public safety.

The breakdown in federal budget negotiations has frozen the release of funding for many of the essential services families rely on nationwide, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap). Liheap helps struggling households keep their heat and lights on by helping eligible families pay their utility bills. With those dollars locked up in Washington gridlock, America’s seniors and working families are now at risk of losing power – just as temperatures start to plummet.

That’s why we’re calling on electric and gas utilities across the country to immediately suspend shutoffs for nonpayment until Liheap funds are released. This isn’t unprecedented: during the early months of the Covid pandemic, we called on utilities to stop shutoff for nonpayment due to the nature of the crisis, and many states and utilities did voluntarily pause disconnections to protect public health. Many states already have a regular practice of pausing disconnections during cold winter months – including Massachusetts, which is leading the way by starting the shutoff moratorium earlier to protect people hurt by the shutdown.

Under normal circumstances, states would already have received Liheap funding. However, because of the shutdown, most states are operating using limited carryover funds from last year’s budget or support from state emergency dollars. Depending on how long the government is closed, full funding may not arrive until well after most states would normally begin to help households pay heating bills.

That delay matters. States spend roughly 80% of Liheap funds during the winter months, when heating costs are highest. Without early funding, millions of low-income households could fall behind on their bills and face their power getting turned off by their utility. And for the 9% of households nationwide who rely on delivered fuels like heating oil or propane which aren’t regulated by public service commissions, a funding delay could mean no heat at all.

Families are getting squeezed on every side by the shutdown. The Trump administration has already fired most of the staff responsible for administering the program, and even recommended eliminating Liheap entirely in its budget proposal.

At the same time, energy prices are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Electricity costs are up 10% nationwide since January, and heating bills are expected to rise nearly 8% this winter. More than 210 electric and natural gas utilities have either already increased rates or proposed rate increases within the next two years. Those increased costs are hitting consumers hard: household energy debt has ballooned to $23bn, up 31% in just 18 months, and one out of every six American households is behind on energy bills. And we’re expecting to see 500,000 more households get shut off this winter compared to last year.

Energy insecurity has become one of America’s most overlooked emergencies. For low-income families, a missed payment isn’t just a financial inconvenience – it’s a crisis. When the power goes out, so do essential medical devices, space heaters, and refrigerators storing insulin and other medicines. In the richest country on earth, no family should have to face a freezing night or an avoidable emergency.

Beyond the shutdown, we need longer-term solutions, like the Heating and Cooling Relief Act, to increase funding and improve outreach for Liheap, so that no household is left behind. Until that happens, utilities have a duty to protect their customers. They should pause shutoffs immediately – or be told to do so by state utility commissioners – and work with state agencies to identify families most at risk. And we’ll be pushing, in Congress and outside, to make that happen.

Because in America, no one should lose heat because Washington can’t keep its own lights on.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/800e75b70986037d2b1a4d011afb3cfb970bdcd3/613_0_2387_1910/master/2387.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6a5b68875f4512cae3b7278aca581a21",N,,2025-11-09 10:58:51.438279

This year’s begins on Monday in the Brazilian rainforest city of Belem.

But what exactly happens at these annual summits? Here’s what you need to know:

WHAT IS A COP?

The annual conference is known as a COP, which stands for Conference of the Parties that signed the 1992 U.N. climate treaty.

The treaty, called the U.N. Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), committed countries to working together to fight climate change – a problem they acknowledged all countries faced and was best tackled together.

The treaty also established the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, meaning the rich countries responsible for most of the planet-warming emissions bear a greater responsibility in solving the problem.

The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the summit agenda and works through the year to rally governments toward shared action and goals. It then hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to the issue while giving national leaders a chance to swap ideas and hold one another accountable.

Over the years, the annual summits have become a major hub of geopolitical and financial discussion – projecting the idea of a “global village” that welcomes all countries, civil society groups, businesses and financiers.

WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT COP30 THIS YEAR?

For many, this year’s 30th climate summit marks as a full-circle moment.

Brazil had hosted the Rio Earth Summit where the UNFCCC treaty was signed 33 years ago. This year, the country insisted the event would return to its roots in acknowledging the world’s most vulnerable including indigenous groups, with some joining the talks.

Brazil has asked countries to work on realizing past promises, such as a COP28 pledges to phase out fossil fuel use, rather than making new ones. COP30 is also the first to acknowledge failure in meeting the past goal of preventing warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Brazil opted to hold COP30 in the Amazon city of Belem – hoping to symbolically underline the importance of world forests that remain targets for logging and industries including mining, farming and fossil fuel extraction.

WHO ARE THE MAIN PLAYERS AT THE SUMMIT?

Most national governments send teams to the talks. Often, countries speak together in groups with similar interests.

Some of the more prominent voices include the Alliance of Small Island States facing an existential threat from rising seas, and the G77+China bloc of developing countries.

Also influential are the Africa Group and the BASIC Group consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.

The U.S., which pledged in January to quit the Paris Treaty on climate change, has stepped away from its past leadership role. China, Brazil and others have stepped in to fill the void.

TWO WEEKS SEEMS A LONG TIME – WHAT HAPPENS AT THE SUMMIT?

The sprawling COP campus is often a hive of activity, with campaigners trying to draw attention to their causes while corporations lobby policy change and seek business deals.

This year has been unique in sloughing off the usual side events and leaving financiers to meet in Sao Paulo while local leaders huddled in Rio de Janeiro. Those events, along with a meeting of world leaders in Belem, were staged before the November 10-21 COP30 in hopes of generating support and momentum for climate action for the actual talks.

During the summit’s first week, country negotiators will lay out their priorities and gauge one another’s positions. Themes should begin to emerge, while countries and companies announce action plans and pledges of financing for projects.

Negotiators are typically joined by national ministers during the second week, to haggle over final decisions including legal and technical details.

THAT SEEMS EASY, RIGHT?

COPs rarely run smoothly, with countries jockeying for deals in their national interest and drawing red lines. The talks can sometimes stall out and lead to acrimony.

Toward the end, negotiators often spend frantic all-night sessions seeking compromises. Countries then reconvene to approve decisions – by consensus, not unanimity.

The closing session, when the hammer of a gavel marks the end of the summit, is almost always delayed – sometimes by several days. Bring snacks.

Is it too late to buy the stock?
Rivian remains a high risk/high reward stock, and after the surge in price following its earnings report, I would probably pump the brakes on the stock for the moment and wait for it to cool down before adding shares here.","The share price of Rivian Automotive (RIVN +0.07%) skyrocketed after the electric vehicle (EV) maker returned to being gross-margin positive and offered upbeat commentary about the upcoming launch of its R2 SUV next year. The stock is now up nearly 50% over the past year after the surge.

Let's take a closer look at the company's results and prospects to see whether or not it's too late to buy the stock.

The R2 remains in focus

The key to Rivian becoming a profitable company that generates free cash flow largely centers around the launch of its new, lower-priced R2 next year. Its current R1 SUV can cost upward of $100,000 when fully loaded, and is thus more in the niche luxury EV SUV market. With a starting price around $45,000, the R2 will appeal to a much broader audience given its more affordable price.

That's only half the story, though. The R2 is also expected to have much better gross margins despite its lower price tag. The reason is that it will have much lower material costs than the R2, which are already contractually locked in with suppliers, and volumes are expected to be much higher, so the cost of building them will also be cheaper per vehicle, because fixed costs get absorbed across more units.

The R2 is expected to drive significant revenue growth for the company starting next year. Management aims to begin manufacturing R2 SUVs for validation by year-end, followed by building them for sale in the first half of next year, before ramping up production in the second half of 2026. In the past, the company has talked about reaching breakeven on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in 2027.

In the third quarter, revenue soared by 78% year over year to $1.6 billion despite fewer vehicle deliveries. The company produced 10,720 vehicles and delivered 13,201 in the quarter, compared to 13,157 vehicles produced and 10,018 delivered a year earlier.

Automobile revenue climbed by 47% year over year to $1.14 billion, while software and service revenue skyrocketed 324% from $98 million to $416 million. About half of its software and service revenue came from its joint venture with Volkswagen.

Importantly, the company was able to return to positive gross margins, posting a gross profit of $24 million. Rivian has worked hard to revamp its manufacturing and lower material costs, with its biggest breakthrough switching to a zonal architecture system that reduces the number of electrical components and wiring needed for a vehicle.

The company was able to shrink its adjusted EBITDA loss from $757 billion a year earlier to $602 million. It also reduced its free cash outflows to $421 million from $1.15 billion a year ago.

Management narrowed its delivery forecast from between 40,000 and 46,000 units to a new range of 41,500 to 43,500. It continues to expect an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $2 billion to $2.25 billion.

The company intends to finish a new factory in Georgia that will be able to make 400,000 vehicles a year. It expects it to come on line in late 2028 and be able to manufacture its planned future R3 crossover vehicle.

Is it too late to buy the stock?

Rivian has been doing a lot of good things, getting to gross margin positive and setting itself up for future success with the R2. Meanwhile, partnerships with Volkswagen and Amazon, together with a large government loan, give a long runway of cash to scale up production.

It also faces some headwinds, though, both with tariffs and the end of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. But management said the impact of tariffs is down to only a few hundred dollars per vehicle, so it is dealing with the situation well.

There was a pull-forward in demand due to the end of the EV tax credits, and it doesn't expect to benefit from the sale of regulatory tax credits next year, which are pure profit.

Review: The Rolls-Royce Spectre Is The Ultimate EV Right Now

Given the car’s $422,000 starting price, the gesture borders on comic relief. The discount feels more like a voucher toward optional extras than any real saving.

Most Rolls-Royce buyers already pour considerable sums into personalizing their cars, a habit that has long been a reliable source of profit for the BMW-owned marque.

According to Cars Direct, the incentive appeared in a recent dealer bulletin distributed by Rolls-Royce. It applies to 2025 and 2026 model-year Spectres leased through November 30.

The brand has quietly trimmed the lease offer from $7,500 to $5,000, with financing carrying an effective interest rate of about 4.6 percent APR.

Even with the credit, the U.S.-spec Spectre still costs more than it did during the now-ended $7,500 federal EV tax credit. That benefit, like the current lease credit, never extended to those who purchased the car outright.

The all-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre has been part of the lineup since 2023 and now comes in two versions. The base car produces 577 hp (430 kW / 584 PS), while the Black Badge version pushes output to 650 hp (485 kW / 659 PS), making it the most powerful model from Goodwood to date. Both use a 120 kWh battery, providing up to 266 miles (428 km) of range on 23-inch wheels.

Other Discounted EVs By High-End Brands

While a $5,000 reduction on a Rolls-Royce is unlikely to sway potential buyers, other luxury automakers are showing far more enthusiasm when it comes to incentives.

Maserati, for instance, has rolled out a substantial $50,000 offer for anyone purchasing or leasing the GranTurismo and GranCabrio Folgore, along with a $25,000 discount on the Grecale Folgore SUV.

Central Health, a taxpayer-funded organization that provides health and wellnessservices for uninsured patients in Travis County, piloted the transitional dialysis program in November 2022. The goal was to provide in-center/outpatient dialysisfor Travis County residents who lacked insurance coverage.

When investigators reviewed data from November 2022 to December 2024 on the 101 patients who enrolled in the program, they observed that there was asignificant decline in the number of days patients utilized emergency dialysis in the hospital prior to finding an outpatient facility. Additionally, within 1 year of starting dialysis, most patients were able to obtain permanent dialysis access with either an arteriovenous fistula or a peritoneal dialysis catheter. Once accepted into the program, Central Health provided an insurance plan to cover outpatient dialysis and transplantation. To date, 18 patients have been listed for kidney transplantation, and 2 have received living donor transplants.

""The program has successfully facilitated dialysis access placement and transplant evaluation,"" said corresponding author Michelle Lubetzky, MD, of The University of Texas, Austin. ""Since Texas has no safety-net plan for patients who do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, the program has the potential to providea cost-effective solution and decrease in utilization of health care resources for those without medical coverage who develop kidney failure. It can be a model for other states and cities that alsolack safety net plans.""

[source: Redwood Materials]","Critical materials such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, and copper are indispensable to the modern American economy. They form the backbone of technologies ranging from computers and smartphones to energy storage, defense systems, and AI data centers.

However, the United States currently imports almost all of these essential minerals, often sourcing them from volatile regions or geopolitical rivals. Redwood’s mission is fundamentally aimed at transforming this dependency and establishing a secure, domestic supply.

Redwood is rapidly becoming a pivotal domestic producer of critical minerals. The company is now comparable to the largest U.S. source of nickel and stands alone as the only large-scale domestic source of cobalt. Furthermore, its operations represent one of the most significant, and virtually sole new, domestic sources of lithium and copper to emerge in decades.

With approximately 90% of all lithium-ion batteries processed in North America passing through its facilities, Redwood’s Nevada Campus produced over 60,000 metric tons of materials last year, establishing it as one of the nation’s most vital sources of critical minerals, whether mined or recycled. The company is now expanding its capacity with the initial startup of its South Carolina campus, adding an initial 20,000 metric tons of annual materials production.

The extraction of critical minerals is expensive, and the global supply chain remains fragile and dominated by China. Yet, as one of the world’s largest consumers of EVs, consumer electronics, and power tools, America already possesses a tremendous internal reserve of lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese, currently locked inside everyday products.

For instance, the U.S. fleet of five million electric vehicles alone contains an estimated 2.25 million metric tons of these materials. These resources can first be unlocked through reuse in stationary storage systems and subsequently through the full recovery and refining of the underlying minerals.

Redwood’s objective is to keep these resources within the United States—recovered, refined, and redeployed for the nation’s strategic advantage. This strategy effectively converts yesterday’s imports into tomorrow’s strategic stockpile, making the U.S. more competitive, resilient, and less susceptible to foreign supply chain controls.

Access to critical minerals is not merely an economic concern; it is a vital matter of national security. The same materials powering batteries are essential for the technologies that ensure the nation’s operations and security.

Nickel and Cobalt are necessary for specialized aerospace and defense alloys.

Copper forms the foundation of industrial wiring and power transmission.

Cobalt and Copper are also critical components in the manufacturing of semiconductors and advanced electronics.

By providing domestic access to these materials, Redwood helps ensure the U.S. maintains the resources necessary for military readiness, technological leadership, and energy resilience at home.

South Carolina: The Next Hub for Recovery and Refining

The company has successfully commenced operations at its 600-acre campus in Berkeley County, South Carolina, with the first facility already recovering critical minerals. This initial step marks a significant beginning toward what is planned to become one of the world’s largest recovery, refining, and manufacturing campuses. Redwood is committed to continued growth in South Carolina over the next decade, which is projected to create more than 1,500 high-quality jobs.

South Carolina, a long-standing leader in advanced manufacturing across textiles, automotive, and aerospace, is now taking its next strategic step into critical minerals. By securing and processing these resources domestically, the state strengthens both its economy and the national interest, contributing to the rebuilding of American industry through high-value manufacturing, energy security, and local job creation.

By achieving large-scale recovery of critical minerals, Redwood is laying the foundation for American leadership in advanced manufacturing, infrastructure, and the high-power technologies of the future. With recycling operations now running in South Carolina, the company is actively helping to transform the U.S. into a nation capable of securing and reusing its own essential resources.

SOURCE: Insight M","SierraCol Energy has achieved the prestigious OGMP 2.0 Gold Standard from the United Nations Environment Programme’s International Methane Emissions Observatory (UNEP-IMEO), underscoring its position as a regional leader in transparent, cost-effective methane management.

In only two years since joining OGMP 2.0, SierraCol reached Level 5 reporting across its material assets and met all criteria for the Gold Standard – a distinction recognizing companies with the highest quality measurement-based methane data and verified mitigation performance. According to UNEP’s An Eye on Methane 2025 report, “SierraCol and Kiwetinohk reported assets at Level 5 in their second year of membership”, achieving the Gold Standard within two years of joining the initiative.

SierraCol’s achievement represents not just an environmental milestone but also a demonstration of leadership in operational excellence and responsible growth. The company’s discipline in setting NPV-positive decarbonization initiatives – each with a payback in the short term – reinforces that emissions reduction can create measurable economic value and align with business performance.

“Reliable methane measurements drive high-impact decarbonization – guiding investment toward projects that deliver quick, measurable, and lasting value” said Juan Carlos Lopez Ballen, Head of Decarbonization and water footprint, at SierraCol Energy.

SierraCol’s rapid progress builds on its early recognition in the An Eye on Methane 2024 report, where UNEP highlighted its “best-in-class implementation plan” among first-year participants – including robust reduction targets, comprehensive mitigation plans, and a clear roadmap for Level 4 and Level 5 reporting across material assets.

To achieve this year’s milestone, SierraCol partnered with Insight M as its technical solutions provider for Level 5 measurement campaigns. Insight M employed integrated, measurement-based methodologies – combining site-level screening and source-level quantification – to reconcile methane emissions across diverse field conditions. This approach enhanced the accuracy and reliability of SierraCol’s OGMP 2.0 data and provided the measurement integrity necessary for UNEP’s Gold Standard verification.

“SierraCol’s success demonstrates how rigorous measurement and innovative technical design can transform methane management from a compliance task into a leadership advantage,” said David Bercovich, Chief Executive Officer at Insight M. “Our collaboration shows that strong data and practical implementation can deliver both climate impact and economic performance.”

SierraCol’s advancement exemplifies how credible data, reliable measurement, and strong governance can accelerate progress toward measurable methane reduction. Together, SierraCol, Insight M, and OGMP 2.0 are helping define what meaningful, verifiable methane leadership looks like across the energy sector in Latin America.

As the federal shutdown heads into its 42 day, the longest shutdown in U.S. history, funding could be delayed for LIEAP. The federally-funded program helps more than 200,000 households in North Carolina. Its applications are split in two categories.

The priority group applies for assistance from Dec. 1-31. These households include people ages 60 or older or people with disabilities who are receiving services through the state’s Division of Aging and Adult Services. Eligible participants must earn 150% above the poverty line. For example, a one-person household making $23,475 a year is considered 150% above the poverty level.

All other low-income households can apply for assistance between Jan. 1 to March 31. Eligible applicants must earn 130% of the poverty line, which is $20,345 a year for a one-person household.

Buncombe County served 1,529 households through the program last year, 221 of those were elderly or disabled according to Kimberly Fullerton, program administrator for the county’s health and human services department.

The program provides a one-time payment to utility companies such as Duke Energy or French Broad Electric to help eligible households pay their heating bills.

Summer Tonizzo, senior media relations manager for the NC Department of Health and Human Services, told BPR in an email that households who are part of the elderly or disabled group may automatically be approved again this year.

“If the government shutdown continues, no additional funding will be available, and new applications will not be accepted,” Tonizzo said. “Only those who are pre-approved will receive assistance.

COPENHAGEN, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, November 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Norrsent, a global leader in enterprise risk and compliance technology, today announced two milestone initiatives that redefine how organizations manage risk in an age of transformation: the launch of its AI-native Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) platform and the debut of its Climate Partner Program, a global effort to support organizations pursuing decarbonization and sustainability goals.

“Risk management has long been about hindsight. We’re making it about foresight. Our new ERM platform uses AI to learn from your data, predict emerging risks, and guide leaders toward smarter, faster decisions—while the Climate Partner Program ensures that climate innovators can access the same tools without financial barriers.”

AI Meets ISO 31000:

Built on the ISO 31000 framework and deployed on secure AWS multi-AZ cloud infrastructure, Norrsent’s new platform transforms risk management from a compliance exercise into an intelligent, adaptive system.

Organizations can model risks across subsidiaries, assets, and projects with role-based access, customizable risk matrices, and immutable audit trails.

Key capabilities include:

- AI-assisted risk identification and mitigation workflows

- Dynamic dashboards with contextual AI Copilot insights

- KRI tracking, control management, and incident reporting

- One-click reporting to Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and PDF

- Enterprise-grade RBAC and SSO integration for full governance

- Every customer environment runs in an isolated schema, ensuring complete data segregation and compliance across jurisdictions.

Introducing the Norrsent Climate Partner Program:

In parallel with the platform launch, Norrsent announced its Climate Partner Program—an initiative to empower decarbonization leaders with free access to Norrsent ERM for their first year.

Through the program, qualifying organizations in sectors such as renewable energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS), green hydrogen, and sustainable manufacturing will receive:

- Full platform access for 12 months, with no user or feature limitations

- Dedicated climate risk support and decarbonization-specific templates

- Membership in a global community of climate leaders

- Expert guidance on multi-project and multi-subsidiary risk frameworks

“Decarbonization projects face a perfect storm of policy uncertainty, technology risk, and financial complexity. Our Climate Partner Program gives pioneers the visibility and control they need to move fast without compromising governance.”

Built for Climate Complexity and Scale:

Decarbonization projects introduce layers of risk—from evolving regulations to supply-chain dependencies. Norrsent ERM enables organizations to consolidate all climate-related risks within one adaptive framework, linking operational metrics to strategic outcomes.

Whether managing a single pilot or an international portfolio, the system scales seamlessly with each organization’s ambition.

Qualified participants can continue under standard enterprise pricing after the first year, ensuring continuity as projects expand.

Driving Sustainability Through Technology:

Norrsent’s twin announcements reinforce its vision that risk management and climate responsibility must evolve together. By embedding AI in the core of enterprise resilience and removing barriers for climate innovators, the company positions itself as a key enabler of the global energy transition.

“Our mission is simple: help organizations turn uncertainty into advantage. When risk management becomes predictive and purpose-driven, both business resilience and the planet benefit.”

That means Prospect Park cut its annual carbon emissions by about 1,620 metric tons, roughly the output of 378 gasoline cars in a year.
Wedged between the University of Minnesota's St. Paul and Minneapolis campuses, Prospect Park is perhaps best known for its Witch's Hat tower.
John Wike, another Prospect Park resident, said he came across Britton's campaign in the neighborhood email.
""We feel Prospect Park is the leading example,"" Gosiewski said.","MINNEAPOLIS -- Mary Britton remembers the distress she felt in the summer of 2019, when images of huge wildfires in Spain and Australia flared up on the internet.

The fires were made worse by climate change, studies showed. Britton, a financial analyst living in Minneapolis, responded by reducing her own carbon footprint.

She insulated her attic, replaced her gas water heater with an electric one and made other energy efficiency upgrades to slash the amount of natural gas she burned to heat her home. She also began sharing information about the upgrades with fellow Prospect Park neighborhood residents and pointed them to the local and federal rebates available to save money on the work.

The effort paid off. Residents of Prospect Park used 29 percent less natural gas between 2019 and the end of 2024, according to CenterPoint Energy, while citywide gas use fell by 20 percent during that period. That means Prospect Park cut its annual carbon emissions by about 1,620 metric tons, roughly the output of 378 gasoline cars in a year.

The Trump administration has turned away from the collective fight to slow global warming, shunning efforts by the United Nations and reversing federal policies that encouraged clean energy. In response, some Minnesotans who care about climate action are turning their attention to changes they can make locally.

Britton said she's already in talks with other neighborhood associations and nonprofits to do similar work in their communities.

""That's the exciting thing -- these people feel part of something bigger,"" she said. ""Everybody waiting for somebody else to do something ... that's not going to work.""

In July, Congress rescinded hundreds of billions of dollars in federal tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the affected credits are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit. Claiming those incentives can save homeowners up to 30 percent off the total cost for various home improvements, including replacing windows, putting in new insulation and installing heat pumps or solar panels. Those credits, which were previously available until 2032, now expire at the end of the year.

Wedged between the University of Minnesota's St. Paul and Minneapolis campuses, Prospect Park is perhaps best known for its Witch's Hat tower. The hilly neighborhood of 875 residential properties spans roughly a square mile.

For Britton, focusing on the changes she can make at the local level, even just in her neighborhood, has helped her cope with the Trump administration's cuts to federal climate and clean energy programs this year, she said. Some of her neighbors expressed similar sentiments.

Nan Kari, who lives down the street from Britton, said the work she's done to reduce the carbon emissions of her home have been cathartic for her. After coming across Britton's campaign, she said, she replaced 11 windows and a door. She also replaced her old HVAC system with a heat pump and a backup furnace.

""That's what it takes, citizen action ... for a larger public good,"" Kari said, adding that she believes local action is especially important ""in the absence of federal leadership -- or corporate leadership, for that matter.""

John Wike, another Prospect Park resident, said he came across Britton's campaign in the neighborhood email. It persuaded him to install insulation in his walls and attic last year. He also insulated part of his roof this month, he said, and will soon install an electric water heater.

Helping the environment was his primary motivation, but the home improvements have also made his century-old house more comfortable, Wike said. ""Especially with insulation in an older house in Minnesota, it's made a huge difference with cold drafts in the winter and heat in the summer,"" he said.

""One of our dogs has passed away recently, but we're getting another dog. And it's like, you don't want to have dogs in the house, where it's 90 degrees in the kitchen,"" Wike said.

The improvements weren't cheap. Both Kari and Wike each spent tens of thousands of dollars for the work, even with the local and federal rebates. But the incentives were a big help, they said, saving them each about $11,000 total. Wike said he expects the federal credits alone to save him $2,400.

CenterPoint Energy said in a statement that Prospect Park is one of the neighborhoods where the company is seeing increased participation in its rebate programs. The utility also noted that 2019 was a below average year for temperatures, while 2024 was an above average year, which influenced the amount of gas used by homeowners.

Still, Prospect Park residents like Kari and Wike view the outcome as a testament to Britton's hard work, which involved regular email blasts through the neighborhood association and visits to local events and church services.

Britton said one thing that she believes helped her campaign was that she never told people what to do -- she only provided them with information and resources.

""People want to do the right thing, but they don't want to be lectured,"" Britton said. ""I never told people to turn down their thermostat.""

Minneapolis residents in other parts of the city are taking note of Britton's campaign as well.

""We've been copying Mary's approach from Prospect Park to engage neighbors in my own Corcoran neighborhood,"" said Sean Gosiewski, executive director of Resilient Cities and Communities, an environmental advocacy group. At least 10 residents in his neighborhood have installed heat pumps this year, thanks to the outreach, he said.

The archive now preserves not just the story of one woman’s career but a record of how environmental justice became a federal commitment.","Dr. Clarice Gaylord was surprised when she received a call from President Barack Obama’s office in 2008. He was attempting to coax her out of retirement to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. “What part of ‘retirement’ don’t you understand?” she recalled asking his team, with a laugh. “I’ve done my work.”

Her refusal was based on one thing: She was ready to rest. By then, Gaylord had spent decades shaping federal environmental policy. Her story is one of bureaucratic persistence and the ability to turn exclusion into strategy, and strategy into national policy.

When Gaylord began her federal career in the 1960s, she was a research scientist studying the causes of breast cancer at the National Cancer Institute. Her work was meticulous and well-regarded, but her upward mobility stopped at the laboratory door.

“One problem I had at the cancer institute was dealing with the superficial prejudice against hiring women and minorities,” she recalled. “They’d hire you for a position, but not a major one.” Determined not to be sidelined, Gaylord applied for a job in personnel. If the system wouldn’t move her, she would move the system.

In 1980, a high school friend had been offered a leadership role at the Environmental Protection Agency but was finishing her PhD and couldn’t accept. She passed Gaylord’s name along to the hiring official, and soon, Gaylord found herself in an interview with Charles Grizzle, the agency’s assistant administrator.

After scanning her resume, Grizzle asked, “Why would a PhD scientist be interested in a job in personnel?” Gaylord recalled telling him that she really wasn’t but wanted to ensure that no other woman or minority was held back from ascending the federal career ladder. Grizzle, stunned but delighted, replied, “This is wonderful. You have a job.”

At the EPA, one of her first acts as personnel director was to analyze where people were, and weren’t, advancing within the agency. The data told a story she already knew: The lowest ranks were filled with women, most of them secretaries, who rarely had the credentials to move into higher-paying technical or administrative positions.

Rather than accept that as immutable, Gaylord established a training partnership between the EPA and a nearby community college, offering courses that would qualify secretaries for higher-grade positions, paid for by the agency. Some managers threatened to fire secretaries who applied. Gaylord, unfazed, marched into their offices to remind them that supporting their staff’s professional growth wasn’t optional.

The program worked. Secretaries became administrators. Some became managers. Gaylord’s own assistant enrolled in the program and later moved up the ranks. Across the agency, women started envisioning careers that stretched decades ahead. And that was just the beginning for Gaylord.

In the early 1990s, EPA administrator William Reilly called Gaylord into his office with an unexpected proposal. He wanted her to create something that didn’t yet exist: A federal program focused on environmental equity and justice.

At the time, from protests in Warren County, North Carolina, to marches in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, the battle for environmental justice had started to intensify in the streets and in the courthouse. Within the EPA, though, efforts to address environmental injustice were viewed as an intrusion, something that would complicate the current long-standing programs. But Gaylord knew there was a bigger picture.

With a skeleton staff and almost no budget (she was given just $400,000 to cover a national initiative), she set about defining what environmental justice would mean inside the federal government. Her first move was structural. She created the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), modeled on the scientific advisory boards she’d worked with at the cancer institute. The council would bring together experts, community leaders, and academics to ensure that research and funding reached the communities most affected by pollution.

She also established a program linking historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) with major research institutions like Harvard and Yale. The idea was simple but revolutionary: Pair universities that had access to federal grants with those that had access to communities. “White researchers told me, ‘They don’t want to talk to us,’” Gaylord recalled. “I told them, ‘That’s why you’ll work with Black colleges.’”

Through her efforts, HBCUs gained new visibility and funding in environmental research. She also launched a paid internship program for Black college students, ensuring that environmental policy would no longer be shaped without them in the room.

Resistance came swiftly. When President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 in 1994, directing all federal agencies to develop strategies for environmental justice, many at the EPA dismissed it as an “unfunded mandate.” Offices responsible for clean air, clean water, and toxic waste argued that they already had laws to follow. Gaylord’s initiatives, they said, were redundant.

To build consensus around the initiative, she invited staffers to spend six months embedded in her department. They learned the principles of environmental justice, then returned to their divisions as in-house experts. “They didn’t want to do it at first, and they asked, ‘Who’s going to pay for this?’” she recalled. But soon, they saw the advantage.

Dr. Marva King was a contracting officer for the Department of the Navy when she read an environmental policy book and first learned about, and became interested in, environmental justice. “There was a program for women that wanted to break the ceiling, and I thought this could help me,” King said. “Then, I found out that they had just started a program at the Environmental Protection Agency called the Office of Environmental Justice and had hired Clarice Gaylord to be the director.” Soon enough, Gaylord had hired King.

Gaylord and King made the perfect pair, ensuring that communities had a seat at the table and that their voices were heard in the conversation on environmental justice. But navigating the politics of a federal agency as a Black woman wasn’t easy. “People are always doubting what you’re doing or not doing and also not respecting and appreciating you, and the way you are as a person,” King said. “Black women, especially those of us who manage others, get this a lot.”

The work came with an additional emotional toll as well. King said, “I’ve been to communities where I saw men come home and take their work clothes off on the porch and leave them. . . . They were trying to do what they could, but it made no difference because that pollution was still coming over from across the road, into their homes, their backyards, the schools, the churchyards. They were eating food from the contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water.”

By the time Gaylord retired in 1999, environmental justice was written into the EPA’s mission. The office she’d started in a basement, without even a phone line, had become one of the agency’s most influential programs. Under her direction, law schools received funding to train students in civil rights–based environmental law, and community programs documented exposure in low-income neighborhoods. Her commitment inspired a generation of environmental leaders who built on Gaylord’s foundation by tackling air pollution at the community level. Many of the EPA’s current environmental-justice programs still trace their frameworks directly to Gaylord’s initiatives.

Gaylord has received more than 30 awards, including from the State of Connecticut and Howard University’s Distinguished Alumni award. Yet she kept most of them tucked under her bed. “They were heavy,” she joked, “and I was done carrying things.”

When the Library of Congress called in 2024 to acquire her papers, she and her daughter, Altoria Gaylord, packed boxes of photographs, memos, speeches, and correspondence from her decades of public service. “We signed the paperwork donating mom’s work for the betterment of the American people,” Altoria said. The archive now preserves not just the story of one woman’s career but a record of how environmental justice became a federal commitment.

Gaylord’s advice for the next generation of environmental-justice workers? “It’s one thing to identify a problem,” she said. “But you have to be strategic and take action to see progress. It’s important to keep people informed on how to do the work, both now and in the future.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-09 07:19:18.860004

Here's why.,"undefined, thenevadaindependent.com, eric-neugeboren, tabitha-mueller",,,,,https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/almost-all-nevada-film-tax-credits-arent-used-by-film-companies-heres-why/,"But typically lost in the discussion is the fact that few Nevada film tax credits are used by the film industry at all.
Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program.
In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees.
Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits.
Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.","For years, those looking to expand Nevada’s film tax credit program have touted their potential to bring jobs, diversify the state’s economy and even provide funding for pre-K programs.

But typically lost in the discussion is the fact that few Nevada film tax credits are used by the film industry at all.

In the more than 10-year history of Nevada’s film tax credit program, more than 98 percent of the credits have been transferred from movie studios to other companies. In total, the state has issued more than $35 million in tax credits, but only about $600,000 have not been transferred.

In Nevada, film tax credits offered by the state are transferrable by law, meaning that studios qualifying for the credits are allowed to sell the credits to other businesses for cash (usually for less than the value of the credits), which can then use them to offset their own tax liability. The three tax types that the credits can be used for are not significant burdens on film companies, which is why they rarely use it themselves.

That structure is not novel — federally, these kinds of credits have been created for projects ranging from clean energy to low-income housing, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Now, Nevada lawmakers could massively expand the film tax credit program by twelve-fold in the upcoming fall special session, prompting concerns from progressive groups and economists opposed to film tax credits that it could functionally serve as a handout to already wealthy corporations and prevent the state from using its dollars on other programs.

“The only purpose to make these tax credits transferable is to launder subsidy payments through other businesses’ tax returns,” said James Hohman, director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a Michigan-based nonprofit that advocates for limited government. “The derogatory term ‘launder’ may seem extreme. That's exactly what is going on in the situation.”

UNR Economics Professor Elliott Parker disagreed with Hohman’s characterization, saying it’s a frequently used tool for economic development, and referred to the transferable structure as more of a “sleight of hand” budgeting maneuver.

“We’re making it look like we're giving them a break on the taxes that they pay,” Parker explained. “But in fact, what we're doing is we're allowing them to make money by selling it to other firms that would have been paying those taxes.”

But he said the proposal to set aside $120 million in tax credits each year for the next 15 years would undoubtedly have an effect on the state’s budget and ability to collect taxes and that’s something lawmakers need to consider.

Proponents of film tax credits have said transferable credits are preferred by governments as a means to attract and sustain economic activity because they do not require a direct cash appropriation to a company, which is prohibited under state law.

David O’Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes — the developer behind the proposed studio project — said the legislation is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” that requires $1.8 billion in investments from companies before they receive the credits, and the whole idea is for the state to meet economic goals and create jobs it wouldn’t get without the tax credits.

“The proposed legislation doesn’t hand out cash — it rewards private investment and local hiring,” O’Reilly said. “These are precisely the kinds of smart, performance-based incentives that will help future-proof Nevada’s economy and keep our most talented residents working here at home.”

How the transferring works

As is the case with Nevada’s existing film tax credit program, the proposal likely to be discussed during the upcoming special session could be used to offset payments related to the state’s insurance premium tax, gaming license fees or modified business tax (which is assessed on payroll).

However, film studios are only subject to the payroll tax, meaning that the credits would likely be sold for cash to gaming or insurance companies to offset their own tax burden.

Additionally, film companies are not significantly burdened by the payroll tax, according to information provided by the Nevada Film Office, which oversees the tax credit program. That means it could take considerable time for the tax credit to be redeemed in full, according to the film office. The credits must be redeemed within four years of being granted.

It is also standard practice for film production companies to use outside groups to facilitate payroll for their employees, meaning those third parties would be subject to the tax rather than the film production company.

In the past three fiscal years, companies have used about $8.5 million in film tax credits against the insurance tax, with about $5 million used against the gaming fees. Credits used for the modified business tax are a distant third.

Notably, the state considers the individual details of these transfers to be confidential, leaving the public in the dark about which companies are buying the tax credits and how much in cash the film studios are receiving in return. Typically, the companies receive the credits at a discounted rate, meaning the cash return for film companies is less than the value of the transferred credits. The companies that purchase credits at a discount, however, receive the full face value of the credits off their tax bills — so they effectively get a tax break.

Hohman, who opposed a similar proposal in Michigan, added that the confidentiality of these transactions “is a travesty.”

“People should know who's collecting their taxpayer money,” he said.

What the proposal says

Under the proposal likely to come up in this special session — sponsored by Assms. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) and Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas) — the state starting in 2028 would set aside $120 million in annual transferable tax credits for the industry for the next 15 years, an exponential increase from the existing $10 million annual limit.

Of this pot of money, $95 million would be set aside annually for productions at a yet-to-be-built studio in Las Vegas’ Summerlin community, while the remaining $25 million would be available for productions elsewhere in the state. There’s likely more opportunity for developers to use the tax credits themselves on that larger-scale project.

The base amount of credits that a film production company could receive is 30 percent of all qualified expenses, which can cover anything from set construction to facility leasing. However, that number could be lowered if the company does not hire enough Nevada workers or does not provide sufficient training or work opportunities to underrepresented groups.

An amended version of the bill also put forward new spending requirements for production companies, including investments of $900 million in construction by the end of 2029 and $1.8 billion in capital investment by the end of 2038. If they fail to meet these milestones, the amendment could require a lien be placed against the remaining undeveloped land in an amount equal to the shortfall. Nevada’s existing film tax credit program does not require private investment or workforce training.

The credits would expire six years after they are issued, an increase from the four-year limit that is in place with the existing program.

Because of this leeway in using the credits, opponents say it could be a pain point for the state budgeting process. If production companies chose to redeem tens of millions of dollars worth of credits in the same year, that would mean less revenue coming into the state, potentially imperiling other initiatives that require state dollars.

“We could see significant [redeeming of credits] during an economic downturn when the state faces its own revenue challenge,” said UNLV economist Michael Brown, the former head of the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/10/70659a9f-studio-union-rally-101525-10.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 10:58:47.911130

It further called for 80 percent of climate finance to be directed toward locally led adaptation efforts.","COP30 Leaders’ Summit concluded with the adoption of the ‘Call of Bel&eacute;m for the Climate’, a declaration urging accelerated global efforts to confront the worsening climate crisis. Meeting in the Amazonian city of Belém—33 years after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and marking the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement—heads of state reaffirmed their commitment to multilateral climate action, solidarity, and sustainability.

The declaration underscored that “climate change is no longer a threat of the future—it is a tragedy of the present.” Leaders highlighted the urgent need to address intensifying floods, droughts, and wildfires that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. The Call of Bel&eacute;m emphasized bridging the “ambition, implementation, and means-of-implementation gaps” that continue to hinder progress toward the 1.5°C target.

The declaration outlined several key priorities, including tripling adaptation finance by 2030 and fully operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund. It also emphasized implementing the Baku–Belém Roadmap, which aims to mobilize $1.3trn annually by 2035 for developing countries. Leaders stressed the need to strengthen climate governance, reform global financial systems, and expand fair, grant-based climate finance.

Furthermore, the declaration called for advancing the transition away from fossil fuels in a just and equitable manner to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while integrating technology transfer, digital innovation, and inclusive development into all aspects of climate action.

Nepal highlighted its rapid transition toward electric mobility and clean energy, and its strong policy frameworks through NDC 3.0 and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP)

‘Climate crisis is our daily reality’

Representing Nepal at the summit, government officials reaffirmed the country’s leadership in nature conservation and sustainable development despite its negligible carbon footprint.

“Nearly 46 percent of Nepal’s land remains under forest cover, protected in partnership with local communities and Indigenous Peoples,” Nepal’s statement read. “Home to Mount Everest and the Himalayas, our country sustains vital ecosystems that provide clean air and fresh water to billions downstream,” said Rajendra Prasad Mishra, Secretary at the Ministry of Forests and Environment.

Nepal highlighted its rapid transition toward electric mobility and clean energy, and its strong policy frameworks through NDC 3.0 and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). Earlier this year, the country hosted the Sagarmatha Sambaad, a global dialogue that reinforced collective commitment to multilateralism and keeping global warming below 1.5°C.

However, the statement warned that for mountain nations like Nepal, “the climate crisis is not a future threat but a daily reality.” Over 300 lives were lost this year alone to floods, landslides, droughts, glacial lake outbursts, and forest fires intensified by extreme temperatures.

Nepal called on COP30 to deliver concrete outcomes, including the realization of the Baku–Belém Roadmap for mobilizing $1.3trn in climate finance, tripling adaptation finance, and fully operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund with simplified and direct access for vulnerable countries. “We no longer have the luxury of delay,” Nepal’s statement concluded. “Let us act now—together—to safeguard our people, their livelihoods, and our planet.”

Youths call for climate justice and inclusion

Youths have called for urgent and equitable climate action through a pre-COP30 discussion with government representatives including Madan Prasad Pariyar, Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development. The dialogue “From the Himalayas to the Amazon: Understanding Climate Negotiations and Nepal’s Engagement” highlighted youth priorities and Nepal’s climate agenda, connecting voices from the Himalayas to the Amazon. For young people in Nepal, a country contributing less than 0.1 percent of global emissions yet among the most climate-vulnerable, the climate crisis is not a future concern but a lived reality. Melting glaciers, erratic rainfall, and worsening floods and droughts have already threatened livelihoods, ecosystems, and our collective future.

In Nepal, youth are already leading the way, organizing climate campaigns, promoting clean energy, and advancing resilience in communities. Yet, their inclusion in decision-making remains limited. Genuine youth participation must be institutionalized, not symbolic, so that young people are recognized as partners in shaping climate policy and solutions, they say.

The event, organized by Clean Energy Nepal, Nepalese Youth for Climate Action (NYCA), and in collaboration with other youth networks, aimed to strengthen youth understanding of international climate processes and align youth advocacy with Nepal’s national climate priorities. “This initiative gave us the platform to translate our concerns into concrete policy recommendations. Nepalese youth are not only demanding change, we are helping shape it,” said Aakriti Dotel, Network Coordinator of NYCA.

The declaration underscored that “climate change is no longer a threat of the future—it is a tragedy of the present”

During the meeting, youth representatives presented a joint statement outlining collective priorities for Nepal’s engagement at COP30. In their official submission to the Ministry, they urged the government to keep 1.5°C alive by upholding science-based ambition, emphasizing that every fraction of a degree matters for mountains and communities.

They called for climate justice, prioritizing fairness for the Global South and ensuring that vulnerable nations receive support rather than debt. The statement highlighted the need for grant-based finance, technology transfer, and capacity building to enhance adaptation and resilience, alongside the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund for recovery from unavoidable climate impacts. It further called for 80 percent of climate finance to be directed toward locally led adaptation efforts.

The youths also emphasized the importance of advancing the Dushanbe Glacier Declaration 2025, integrating the mountain agenda into global policy, and institutionalizing the participation of youth, women, and Indigenous Peoples in all climate processes. Additional priorities included promoting clean energy and a just transition through renewable energy and green jobs, recognizing the linkages between climate change, health, and sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR), and upholding accountability and human rights in line with the ICJ ruling obligating all nations to align their actions with the 1.5°C target.

Minister Pariyar welcomed the youth recommendations, assuring that their perspectives would be integrated into Nepal’s COP30 position. “Youth voices are vital in shaping effective climate strategies. The government will continue to create platforms for young people to contribute meaningfully to climate action,” he said.",https://annapurnaexpress.prixacdn.net/media/albums/COP30_Nepal_aQSUEXX7Ma.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 07:58:32.813196

This as the average global renewable power capacity growth falls short of the required trajectory to achieve the tripling target by 2030.

For the tripling of renewable power capacity to reach 11.2 terawatts (TW) in 2030, an average of 1122 gigawatts (GW) per annum is required between 2025 and 2030. Whereas in 2024, 581.9 GW of new renewable power capacity was added, representing a 15.1 percent annual growth rate, this represented an increase of just 0.7 percentage points compared to the 14.4 percent growth reported in 2023.

If the growth rate seen in 2024 continued for the remaining years of the decade, only 10.3 TW of renewable power capacity would be installed by 2030, falling 0.9 TW (7.7 percent) short of the target, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has revealed.

In October, IRENA published a report in which it assessed the progress of the COP28 historic UAE Consensus. The COP28, 2023 consensus, in which 133 countries pledged to triple global installed renewable power capacity by 2030 compared to 2022 levels, has a critical milestone for keeping the 1.5°C goal within reach.

Since capacity additions in both 2023 and 2024 fell short of the required 16.1 percent growth rate, renewable capacity must now expand even faster (16.6 percent annually) in the remaining six years of the decade to deliver 6.7 TW of installed renewable power capacity.

Whereas only nine countries, all in the European Union, had targets covering power, heat and fuels, just a few countries, such as Montenegro, Ukraine, and Slovenia, announced or updated renewable heat targets. Elsewhere, some, like Japan, the Philippines and Poland, revised their biofuel mandates in 2024.

“An assessment of national energy plans and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) shows that NDCs collectively target 5.8 TW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, 22 percent less than the national energy plans and policies of 7.4 TW target. This misalignment between domestic policy and NDC targets can signal a mismatch between domestic priorities and commitments to the international community,” the IRENA report discloses.

An analysis of the NDC targets for Least Developed Countries’ (LCDs) shows that of the 60 GW of additional capacity targets by 2030, 38 GW (or 60 percent) are conditional on receiving international financial assistance.

Elsewhere, 65 percent of targeted capacity from small island developing states (SIDS) were also conditional (2.8 GW), with 56 percent as well conditional in sub-Saharan Africa (34 GW).

However, an estimated $71b out of $116b (or 61 percent) of the investment is required from international sources as concessional finance to meet the required investment for capacity additions.

The report also detailed how national plans and targets for renewable power generation capacity have increased by just 2.0 percent following the adoption of the tripling of renewable power goal at the COP28 held in the UAE in 2023.

A quantification of the renewable power targets in NDCs submitted as of 1 October 2025 revealed that existing targets aim to collectively increase total renewable energy capacity to approximately 5.8 TW by 2030, from 4.4 TW today. Little wonder, Mr Francesco La Camera, director-general, IRENA, says energy efficiency improvements have been negligible.

The equitable deployment and distribution of this renewable power will depend, La Camera added, on the international community’s ability to unlock additional financing for renewables, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies.

Last week, IRENA launched the second Accelerated Partnership for Renewables in Africa (APRA) Investment Forum in Freetown, Sierra Leone, aiming to scale up investments and advance the energy transition and green industrialisation across APRA countries.

The two-day event built on the success of last year’s inaugural forum in Nairobi, Kenya, which mobilised a project pipeline valued at $2.7b and around 1 GW of potential renewable power generation capacity. The forum aimed to bridge the gap between Africa’s renewable potential and the pace of its deployment by mobilising investment and facilitating matchmaking between project promoters, developers, and potential investors.

Every year, countries that have joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meet to measure progress and negotiate multilateral responses to climate change.

Today, there are 198 Parties to the Convention. The UNFCCC is a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992 shortly after the first assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990 to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations ""at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system.”

Since entering into force in 1994, the UNFCCC has provided the basis for international climate negotiations, including landmark agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015). COPs have created global milestones for the climate movement.

In 2024, 581.9 GW of new renewable power capacity was added, representing a 15.1 percent annual growth rate, an increase of 0.7 percentage points. The capacity growth still falls short of the trajectory required to achieve the tripling target by 2030.

“Interconnection wait times have spiked in some markets where grid planning has not taken into account the tripling goal. Grid constraints have also become more impactful, with technical curtailment growing,” the report says.

In least developed countries (LDCs), energy access deficits tend to remain high, financing costs are exorbitant, and debt-to-GDP ratios are among the highest in the world. Annual average investments in renewable power capacity between 2025 and 2030 must increase by 2.3 times to around $1.44 trillion per year compared to $0.6 trillion in 2024.

Total global investment in renewable power generation capacity reached $624b in 2024. However, this growth rate is well below the 28 percent growth observed in 2023. While the technological maturity of renewables and supportive policies have positioned the industry at the heart of climate and energy strategies, there is still a substantial investment and financing gap in the volumes needed for the tripling goal globally.

According to Dr Kandeh Yumkella, Energy Sector Lead, chairman of the Presidential Initiative on Climate Change, Renewable Energy and Food Security (PI-CREF), substantial investment is essential for the energy transition ambitions of African nations to be realised.

Africa, which is home to 17 percent of the global population, has received less than 2.0 percent of worldwide investments in renewable energy in the last decade. Changing this will require reformed and enhanced public finance at all levels, Dr Kandeh told delegates at the 2025 APRA Investment Forum.

Africa requires an average annual investment of $70b in renewable energy, yet investments in 2023 reached only $15b, a record high, but still just 2.3 percent of global investment in the sector. Through the Nairobi Declaration, African countries aim to install 300 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 to meet the increasing demand and drive Africa's transition to a low-carbon future.

On the sidelines of the conference, Dr Fadhel Kaboub, associate professor of Economics, Denison University, said only deliberate structural transformation, partnerships and collaboration among African countries will help them to achieve their targets.

“We must start thinking about joint industrial policies, which require strategic planning, long-term cooperation with partners that have the technology, and a win-win scenario for the African continent, for the APRA countries, and for the partner countries from the industrialised world,” Dr Kaboub said.

“The structural transformation requires policies that simultaneously address the root causes of external debt, but all of these are climate adaptation policies. Investing in renewable energy sovereignty, and in real green industrialisation that gets us out of the bottom of the hierarchy as exporters of raw materials, is the real deal,” he added.

In October, IRENA launched the second Accelerated Partnership for Renewables in Africa (APRA) Investment Forum in Freetown, Sierra Leone, seeking to scale up investments to advance the energy transition and green industrialisation across APRA countries.

African countries are gearing up for the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil, not just with a climate agenda but a new and broader model of continental cooperation aimed at tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling the energy efficiency by 2030.

Last week, African leaders, including policymakers, senior government leaders, central bank officials, economists and development partners, met for the G20 conference in Dakar, Senegal, to discuss how the continent can consolidate and protect its gains.

Currently, Africa has only 70 GW of installed renewable power capacity, representing 1.6 percent of the global total. However, to meet growing electricity demand, IRENA says electricity generation will need to increase by 36 percent by 2030, and to triple by 2050, compared to 2023 levels.

Under the 1.5°C Scenario, the unlocking of sustainable renewable energy resources to meet the 2030 target would require a quadrupling of capacity to around 300 GW by 2030, in line with the 2023 Nairobi Declaration, it states.

Sub-Saharan Africa’s external debt stock reached $863b in 2023, equivalent to 169 percent of total exports, with average bond yields at 9.8 percent. Debt-service costs now consume 16 percent of export revenues, a massive drain on future development.

Addressing illicit financial flows (IFFs), which cost the continent an estimated $88b annually, and establishing regional financing mechanisms such as the African Monetary Fund and the African Stability Mechanism, are crucial to restoring fiscal stability.

Following the Musk model Last week, Tesla shareholders approved a record $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk based on operational and valuation milestones over 10 years.","Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe could earn up to $4.6 billion over a decade through a new compensation plan. This package, mirroring Elon Musk's Tesla deal, links his rewards to ambitious stock price and profitability targets. The automaker aims to retain its founder and fuel growth, especially with the upcoming R2 SUV launch.

Electric vehicle maker Rivian has announced a compensation plan for CEO RJ Scaringe worth as much as $4.6 billion over the next decade. This follows the model established by Tesla CEO Elon Musk's record pay package and linking rewards to new profit targets and lower share price milestones than a previous deal. Rivian's pay package for Scaringe may rank among the richest in corporate history, depending on performance goals achieved.

Rivian CEO package details

Under the new plan, Scaringe is receiving options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian's Class A stock, approximately 16 million more than the previous grant, at an exercise price of $15.22 per share, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. This pay award will only be given to the CEO if the company meets two main sets of goals: Rivian's stock price must reach certain reduced milestones, ranging from $40 up to $140 per share, over the next 10 years. The company must also hit new targets for its operating income and cash flow over the next seven years. If Rivian hits all milestones, Scaringe will receive up to $4.6 billion, including the costs of exercising options, according to Reuters. Rivian said shareholders will gain $153 billion in value.

Following the Musk model

Last week, Tesla shareholders approved a record $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk based on operational and valuation milestones over 10 years. Rivian said the plan will retain its founder and keep him focused on growth and profitability as the automaker, known for its R1S SUVs and R1T pickups, prepares to launch its smaller, more affordable R2 SUV next year. The R2 will compete with Tesla's best-selling Model Y crossover. Rivian's board also doubled Scaringe's base salary to $2 million, saying the changes were made with input from an independent compensation consultant and designed to better align pay with shareholder returns. Separately, Scaringe was granted 1 million common units in Mind Robotics, a newly formed Rivian spinoff with external funding developing industrial AI technology.

That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.
“The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles — they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.” That’s where advanced recycling comes in.
The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.
“Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment.","Welcome to the economic future of the United States: Big Tech, Big Data — and Big … Recycling?

That’s the conclusion of a new analysis from the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which says that if America dominates the coming advanced recycling industry the same way it has dominated technology, the results could be billions in economic activity and tens of thousands of jobs.

The technology needed for the advanced recycling revolution is here, says ACC President Ross Eisenberg. What’s needed is a new mindset. “Recycling is really manufacturing.”

Instead of looking at used plastics as a problem to be solved, he says, they should be seen as a resource to be monetized. That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.

“Mechanical recycling is tried and true,” Eisenberg said, but it can’t handle many of the most common forms of plastic. “The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles — they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.”

That’s where advanced recycling comes in. Unlike mechanical recycling, advanced recycling turns plastics into a gas or liquid raw material — “reducing them back to molecules,” Eisenberg says — which can then be turned into “brand-new plastics for use in virtually any product or packaging type, including food- and pharmaceutical-grade plastics.”

Similar to the way the mining industry supplies raw materials that are turned into consumer products, recycling plastic into its raw form can supply industries with raw materials while removing massive amounts of plastic from the waste stream.

The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.

A 2021 Government Accountability Office report touted the technology. “Chemical recycling can produce raw materials of virgin quality, thereby decreasing demand for fossil fuels and other natural resources,” the report states. “Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment. Chemical recycling creates a market for plastic waste and a new way to reuse some plastics.”

The ACC analysis suggests that widespread use of advanced recycling would create 173,200 jobs with a total annual payroll of $12.8 billion. It could also add $48.7 billion in total economic output — the combined value of goods and services produced directly and indirectly as a result.

“Essentially the same economic contributions annually of the milk industry in the United States,” Eisenberg said.

The challenge is no longer technology, but regulation, Eisenberg says. Calling the current political landscape a “plethora of regulatory barriers,” he urged state and federal governments to consider the advanced recycling of plastics as manufacturing instead of waste incineration. Any plastic produced through this process would be subject to recycling regulations.

“We think that would really help unlock some of the private investment that has been waiting to go,” he said.

The ACC is calling for a consistent national framework with clear standards, funding, incentives, infrastructure build-up and public education. Eisenberg said those standards would help with the recycling process and recycled materials, along with waste reduction.

The plastics industry still faces plenty of skepticism from environmental groups and lawmakers. Organizations such as Greenpeace USA have claimed very little plastic is being recycled, and the World Wildlife Fund has called for a ban on single-use plastic cups and cutlery by the end of the year. More than 500 U.S. communities have banned single-use plastic bags, and a dozen states have done likewise.

According to Environmental Protection Agency data, 32% of disposable items are recycled annually. Raising that rate to the EPA’s goal of 50% by 2030 will require major changes in how plastics are processed.

Critics are stuck in the past, Eisenberg says, adding that the plastics industry has changed. Plastic products are now designed with “end of life” in mind from the outset of production. It’s an approach that, with the aid of new technology, can promote recycling and stimulate the economy.

“Obviously, there’s an environmental component to this,” Eisenberg says. “We want to clean up the environment. But there’s also a jobs component to this, and we don’t want that to be ignored.”

The Stanford researchers recommended improved, broader public messaging about the benefits of solar panels and backup battery systems.","According to a new study, the proposed termination of federal clean energy tax credits will impact the payback period for people who own solar panels.

When the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates currently available tax credits at the end of 2025, solar panels will become less economically viable for many people.

As Stanford University shared, researchers recently assessed the affordability of solar and backup battery systems in the U.S. They found that most U.S. households can reduce their energy costs with these clean energy solutions in the current market. However, costs are set to increase due to recent federal policy changes.

According to the study, the lost tax credits would bring the percentage of U.S. households for which solar/battery systems make financial sense down from 60% to 32%.

After analyzing more than 500,000 representative households, the Stanford University researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Energy.

They also suggested that ""people may need to buy the equipment by Dec. 31"" to ensure their new rooftop solar panels and battery packs will reduce electricity bills. Taking advantage of the tax credits could also help provide cost-effective energy resilience during power outages.

As the researchers noted, another factor to consider is how much homeowners will get paid for excess solar, which can affect how long it will take for them to recoup their investment.

In some states, homeowners will see less money when selling their excess electricity to local utility companies, which can lengthen the time it will take to earn the money back for the initial installment of the panels. As Stanford shared, ""More than one-third of homes today are in states that pay residential solar owners based on how much their electricity saves the local utility, which is almost always lessen paying homeowners their full electricity rate. The number of states adopting this policy is rising.""

The researchers noted that in some states, such as Iowa, Idaho, and Washington, utility companies are still required to pay homeowners the higher price for their excess solar power.

This research is insightful because it highlights the impressive cost-saving potential of solar energy while preparing homeowners for the realities of selling excess electricity. It also emphasizes the urgent need for pro-climate policies that support a sustainable planet for the future.

Meanwhile, other research teams have been sharing what they've discovered about the decreasing costs of solar power. Recent technological breakthroughs could make solar panels even more efficient as well.

If you act now, you could still qualify for valuable solar tax incentives and start saving money on your monthly bills.

With or without those tax credits, EnergySage is helping homeowners save up to $10,000 on their solar installations. EnergySage's free services include a local installer quote comparison tool and a mapping tool that shows incentives in each state.

If buying solar panels isn't within your budget, consider leasing them for no money down through Palmetto's LightReach program.

Pairing solar panels with a heat pump can save you even more on your energy bills. Mitsubishi can help you find the heat pump and installer that's right for you.

The Stanford researchers recommended improved, broader public messaging about the benefits of solar panels and backup battery systems. They also noted that low adoption in rural and disadvantaged communities only worsens historical inequities.

""Rooftop solar and battery storage, deployed together or separately, offer promising adaptation solutions as they may help to reduce electricity bills, provide backup power during outages, and lower carbon emissions,"" they wrote. ""Policymakers can directly shape this landscape through tariff design, incentive programs, rate approvals, and industry regulations.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-panel-adoptionimage-recRhnXYVTtdEj14I-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 03:19:27.444893

Energy Fuels Inc. (TSX: EFR / NYSE: UUUU) has emerged as a cornerstone player in North America's pursuit of critical mineral self-sufficiency. The company's evolution from uranium-focused operations to a comprehensive Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain architect represents a fundamental shift in how Western economies approach strategic mineral security. This dual-commodity positioning addresses both immediate energy needs through uranium production and long-term technological independence through rare earth element processing.

The convergence of geopolitical tensions and clean energy transitions has created unprecedented urgency around domestic mineral processing capabilities. Furthermore, Energy Fuels occupies a unique position at this intersection, leveraging existing infrastructure and regulatory approvals to address supply chain vulnerabilities that have developed over decades of offshoring critical mineral processing to China.

Revolutionary Domestic Processing Infrastructure

White Mesa Mill: America's Strategic Asset

The White Mesa Mill in Utah stands as the only licensed facility in North America capable of processing monazite mineral concentrates into separated rare earth oxides. This facility holds dual licensing from the Utah Division of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, providing the regulatory framework necessary for handling radioactive materials inherent in monazite processing.

Current Production Specifications:

• Phase 1 Capacity: 1,000 metric tons of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide annually

• Expansion Targets: 4,000-6,000 metric tons with Phase 2-3 developments

• Heavy Rare Earth Timeline: Commercial production targeted for Q4 2026

• Strategic Coverage: Capability to produce six of seven oxides currently subject to Chinese export restrictions

The facility's monazite processing capability represents a critical breakthrough in Western supply chain independence. Moreover, monazite concentrates contain approximately 3-12% thorium content, requiring specialised handling expertise that Energy Fuels possesses through its uranium milling operations. This technical knowledge barrier has historically limited Western rare earth processing development, making the White Mesa Mill's operational status particularly significant.

Advanced Separation Technology Implementation

Energy Fuels employs sophisticated chemical separation processes that transform raw monazite concentrates into high-purity rare earth oxides meeting stringent manufacturing specifications. In addition, the Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain processing involves multiple technical stages:

Acid Digestion Phase: Monazite dissolution using hydrochloric or sulfuric acid systems to separate rare earth elements from gangue minerals

Thorium Isolation: Radioactive thorium separation and containment following NRC regulatory protocols

Selective Precipitation: Individual rare earth oxide separation through controlled crystallisation chemistry

Calcination Processing: Final oxide purification to achieve 99.5%+ purity levels required for permanent magnet applications

The company has successfully qualified its high-purity NdPr oxide for use in permanent magnet manufacturing applications. This represents a crucial milestone in establishing complete domestic supply chain control from raw materials to finished components, particularly relevant to current critical minerals energy transition initiatives.

Multi-Continental Feedstock Security Strategy

Diversified Supply Architecture

Energy Fuels has constructed a geographically diverse feedstock acquisition strategy that reduces dependency on any single supplier or region. This approach directly addresses concentration risks that have historically plagued Western rare earth supply chains.

Feedstock Source Location Material Type Annual Capacity Target Development Status Chemours Partnership Florida/Georgia, USA Monazite concentrates 1,000-1,500 t NdPr oxide Operational Donald Project Victoria, Australia Heavy mineral sands 7,000-8,000 t concentrates Late 2027 target Toliara Deposit Madagascar Monazite-bearing sands Under assessment Evaluation phase Brazilian Operations Brazil Heavy mineral sands Development pending Planning stage

The Chemours partnership represents an innovative circular economy application, transforming previously discarded phosphate production byproducts into valuable rare earth feedstock. However, this arrangement provides immediate operational feedstock while Energy Fuels develops international mining partnerships for long-term supply security.

Heavy Mineral Sands vs. Monazite Processing

The Donald Project in Australia introduces xenotime-bearing heavy mineral sands to the Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain, complementing existing monazite processing capabilities. Furthermore, xenotime contains significantly higher concentrations of heavy rare earths (dysprosium, terbium, yttrium) compared to monazite, addressing critical supply gaps in the most strategically important rare earth elements.

Processing Differentiation:

• Xenotime Chemistry: Requires different acid digestion and separation sequences than monazite

• Heavy REE Concentration: Contains 30-60% heavy rare earths versus 5-10% in monazite

• Supply Reliability: Production tied to established heavy minerals mining operations rather than chemical industry byproducts

Addressing Critical Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Breaking Chinese Processing Monopoly

China currently controls approximately 85-90% of global rare earth processing capacity, creating significant strategic vulnerabilities for Western manufacturers. This concentration has increased despite growth in mining capacity in other regions, highlighting the critical importance of processing capabilities over raw ore availability.

Recent Chinese export control actions have demonstrated the weaponisation potential of rare earth supply chains:

• August 2023: Restrictions implemented on gallium and germanium exports

• July 2024: New export controls requiring government approval for rare earth processing exports

• September 2024: Graphite export restrictions expanded critical minerals export control strategy

The United States currently imports approximately 100% of refined rare earth oxides and has zero domestic processing capacity for rare earth separation outside of Energy Fuels' operations. Consequently, this dependency creates single-point-of-failure risks where geopolitical actions can disrupt supply chains for defence systems, electric vehicles, and renewable energy infrastructure.

Domestic Content Compliance Solutions

Energy Fuels' domestic processing capabilities enable manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent domestic content requirements across defence and clean energy sectors. The Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain provides:

Supply Diversification: Alternative sourcing to Chinese processors reducing geopolitical concentration risk

Regulatory Compliance: Domestic processing enables ""Buy American"" and critical minerals procurement regulation compliance

Supply Chain Transparency: Complete traceability from feedstock to finished oxides meeting defence sector requirements

Strategic Independence: Access to materials not subject to potential foreign export restrictions or trade disputes

These capabilities align with the broader critical minerals strategy being implemented across Western economies.

Financial Architecture and Investment Implications

Capital Deployment Strategy

Energy Fuels' $700 million convertible debt offering represents the scale of capital investment required to establish rare earth processing capabilities in Western markets. This financing structure provides operational flexibility during the ramp-up phase whilst offering future equity participation for investors.

Financial Structure Analysis:

• Convertible Terms: Balance immediate funding needs with future equity dilution management

• Revenue Projections: Analyst estimates suggest $553 million revenue potential by 2028, though these remain highly speculative

• Dual Commodity Exposure: Uranium sales provide cash flow stability during rare earth development phases

Market Volatility and Execution Risks

The rare earth markets exhibit significant price volatility driven by geopolitical factors, technological changes, and supply-demand imbalances. Energy Fuels' success depends on navigating these market dynamics whilst executing complex international project development.

Critical Risk Factors:

• Project Development Delays: International operations subject to permitting and regulatory approval timelines

• Cost Inflation Impact: Construction and operational costs affecting project economics

• Uranium Market Cyclicality: Base business cash flow fluctuations impacting rare earth investment capacity

• Multi-Jurisdictional Regulatory Complexity: Operations spanning Utah, Australia, Madagascar, and Brazil regulatory frameworks

This volatility is compounded by uranium market volatility affecting the company's base business operations.

Disclaimer: Revenue projections and financial forecasts mentioned in this analysis are speculative estimates based on company guidance and analyst models. Actual results may vary significantly due to market conditions, execution risks, and external factors beyond company control.

Geopolitical Catalysts and Strategic Positioning

Chinese Export Control Response Dynamics

Recent Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports have accelerated Western supply chain diversification initiatives. Energy Fuels' operational timing aligns with this geopolitical shift, potentially catalysing adoption of Western supply chains by manufacturers seeking supply security assurance.

The seven critical rare earth oxides subject to Chinese export controls include dysprosium, terbium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, and yttrium. Energy Fuels' claimed capability to produce six of these seven elements directly addresses the most strategically vulnerable supply chain segments.

Furthermore, the recent Critical Minerals Executive Order provides additional policy support for domestic supply chain development initiatives.

National Security and Defence Applications

Rare earth elements serve as critical components in advanced defence technologies, including missile guidance systems, radar equipment, and electronic warfare systems. The Energy Fuels rare earth supply chain addresses national security concerns about foreign dependency in critical defence applications.

The U.S. Department of Defense has identified rare earth processing capacity, not mining capacity, as the primary constraint on domestic supply chain security. Therefore, Energy Fuels' White Mesa Mill operations directly address this strategic bottleneck identified in the National Defense Strategy framework.

US automakers are beginning to scale back their EV manufacturing plans following the untimely demise of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, so now is probably not the best time to beef up the domestic supply chain for EV batteries. Nevertheless, the leading Indian energy storage firm Epsilon Advanced Materials has locked in a supply of precursors to feed its forthcoming graphite anode factory in North Carolina. EAM anticipates that the new facility will pump out enough product to supply about 1 million made-in-the-USA EVs per year, once it achieves full production capacity. Are they nuts?

More Graphite For More EV Batteries … Nope, Epsilon Is Not Nuts

Taking a closer look at that production timeline, EAM is not nuts. They are simply planning ahead. In September, the company reported that the necessary permits are all lined up and the facility is on track to commence operations in 2027, with a 50% capacity target of 30,000 tons, or enough to supply 500,000 EVs.

That’s a little more consistent with the consensus on the near-term outlook for EV sales in the US. Sales spiked leading up to September 30 as buyers rushed to make last-minute deals before the tax credit expired, only to slump precipitously in October after the tax credit vanished. However, auto industry analysts do not generally anticipate that interest in EVs will evaporate entirely. State, dealer, and automaker incentives are still available to some EV bargain hunters, and the potential for savings on TCO (total cost of ownership, including fuel and maintenance) may help keep the EV market treading water for the time being.

In the meantime, the public EV charging network is continuing to grow, offering EV-curious car buyers more confidence in the availability of public and home charging stations. By the time EAM’s new anode factory hits its full production capacity of 60,000 in 2030, federal energy policy may also provide more support. After all, the current occupant of the White House is scheduled to leave office on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes.

A Lower Carbon Footprint For EV Batteries

EAM has also nailed down a precursor supply sufficient to reach the 30,000- and 60,000-ton goal posts. In September, the company entered into an Agreement in Principle with Phillips 66 to supply green and calcined needle coke from its refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Coke is a byproduct of oil refining and coal gasification. So, not particularly green. Nevertheless, it is an essential feature of the EV battery supply chain of today.

“Phillips 66 is among the world’s leading producers of specialty cokes, such as Green and Calcined Needle Coke, which are critical for manufacturing synthetic graphite anodes,” EAM explains, adding that the agreement “brings together Phillips 66’s operational expertise with EAM’s global expansion, reinforcing efforts to build a competitive and resilient supply chain for clean energy technologies across multiple regions.”

As for the decarbonized EV battery supply chain of tomorrow, that’s where things get interesting. Back in 2017, the US Department of Energy identified silicon as an alternative anode material. Aside from reducing the use of fossil-derived materials in the EV battery supply chain, silicon is less expensive than its graphite counterpart.

The Long Road To The Silicon Anode Of The Future

There being no such thing as a free lunch, in 2017 the Energy Department noted that EV battery cells based on silicon and other next generation materials “still suffer major cycle and calendar life issues.”

In particular, silicon anodes degrade over time, aside from degradation directly linked to charging cycles. By 2017, Energy Department researchers identified the nut of the problem, consisting of lithium lost due to reactivity with the electrolyte.

The next steps involved experimenting with salts and electrolyte solvents to stabilize the reaction. By 2021, the Energy Department was all in. The agency tapped its National Renewable Energy Laboratory to lead a new, pumped-up silicon EV battery R&D effort called the Silicon Consortium Project, to be focused like a thousand points of light on solving the calendar-life challenge. SCP combined the Energy Department’s ongoing Silicon Electrolyte Interface Stabilization project and the Silicon Deep Dive program into one multidisciplinary team drawn from the Argonne, Sandia, Oak Ridge, Pacific Northwest, and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories.

“Together, the national laboratories employ advanced characterization techniques coupled with state-of-the-art research facilities to explore the foundational science of organic electrolytes with silicon interfaces to develop the full electrode and cell chemistry,” NREL explained.

“Researchers aim to use these findings to take advantage of silicon’s ability to store more than 3,500 milliamp hours per gram, which could reduce battery pack size by 25%–30%, or increase driving range by 30%–40% with packs the same size as those found in current EVs,” the lab added.

More & Better Silicon EV Batteries

The Energy Department tasked SCP to produce silicon-based anodes with a calendar life of 10+ years, among other attributes leading to the more affordable EV battery of the future. Private sector innovators have not been asleep at the wheel, either. In 2o22, for example, General Motors announced a silicon EV battery deal with the US startup OneD Battery Sciences.

“Silicon can store ten times the energy of graphite alone,” OneD observed. “Being able to add larger amounts of silicon — efficiently — is the essential breakthrough needed to produce competitive EVs that meet market demand for high-performance, affordable vehicles.”

OneD’s “SINANODE” anode is based on graphite infused with silicon nanowires. At the time of the hookup, GM noted that OneD was continuing R&D work on its anode solution while scaling into pilot production. In the latest development, last week OneD announced a joint development agreement with the Chinese carbon materials specialist Shanghai Putailai New Energy Technology Co., aimed at scaling up production.

“Through this agreement, we will combine OneD’s SINANODE technology with Putailai’s world-class graphite manufacturing to deliver higher energy density cells at affordable cost,” emphasized OneD CEO Jeff Chamberlain in a press statement.

They better not let the grass grow under their feet. In September, the US materials startup Sila Nanomaterials announced the start of production at its silicon anode plant in Moses Lake, Washington. EV batteries are the target market along with consumer electronics, drones, satellites, and other applications.

As with EAM, Sila anticipates that EV sales in the US will recover from this year’s counterproductive federal policy. “Operations will initially support 2–5 GWh of capacity, with the capability to expand up to 250 GWh within five years and become the largest anode production facility in the world,” Sila states.

“By manufacturing domestically at unprecedented scale, Sila is replacing graphite, a critical mineral overwhelmingly sourced from China, with a higher-performing, American-made alternative at a time when U.S. manufacturers are acutely focused on cutting supply chain vulnerabilities,” the company also reminds everyone.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth isn’t just a policy—it’s a blueprint for scaling your business.","If you’re building or expanding a manufacturing business in clean energy, understanding the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth could be the key that unlocks millions in new capital. This isn’t just another tax incentive—it’s a cash-flow machine designed to reward U.S. manufacturers that produce the components powering the renewable economy.

Let’s break down exactly how to use the 45X Credit to fuel your own manufacturing growth.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth is a production-based incentive created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to encourage companies to build clean energy components in the United States.

Here’s what makes it different: instead of rewarding installations or projects, it rewards production. Every eligible item you manufacture—like battery cells, solar modules, wind turbine blades, or critical minerals—earns you a dollar-for-dollar tax credit.

Think of it like this: the more you produce, the more you earn.

That means for manufacturers, recyclers, and suppliers in the clean energy supply chain, 45X isn’t just about sustainability—it’s a recurring revenue stream that can be monetized, sold, or reinvested into expansion.

Manufacturing has always been capital-intensive, but the 45X credit changes the math. For the first time, U.S. manufacturers can compete globally with built-in government-backed financial leverage.

When the IRA passed, the U.S. government effectively said: “If you build it here, we’ll help you pay for it.”

Here’s what that means in plain terms:

You get paid for every component produced, not just completed projects.

You can sell your credits through transferability or receive direct cash payments.

You can stack credits (like 48C and 45X) to maximize ROI.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth gives companies predictable income while reducing the risk of scaling. That’s a rare combination in manufacturing finance.

Before the IRA, most clean energy incentives were limited to project-level developers—solar farms, wind farms, or utilities. Manufacturers often got left out. The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth fixed that by focusing directly on the people who make the parts.

Three updates made this credit a game-changer:

Transferability – Companies can sell credits for cash to other taxpayers.

Direct Pay – Qualifying entities can receive the credit as a refund, even without tax liability.

Phase-In Window – The credit runs through 2032, giving manufacturers a full decade to capitalize.

This turns a complicated tax incentive into a liquidity tool—fueling investment, expansion, and job creation.

Start by analyzing your production process. Which of your components fall under the 45X eligibility list? If you’re already manufacturing solar, wind, battery, or hydrogen equipment, you’re likely eligible.

If you’re still planning your facility, design it with 45X in mind. Many companies are now reverse-engineering production strategies to maximize eligibility—producing higher-margin components that qualify for larger credits.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth isn’t a flat percentage—it’s a per-unit system. Each product type earns a fixed amount.

For example:

Battery cells = $35 per kWh produced.

Battery modules = $10 per kWh.

Solar cells = $0.04 per watt.

Those numbers add up quickly. A mid-sized battery plant producing 500 MWh annually could earn $17.5 million per year in credits—and that’s before stacking other incentives.

At Icarus Fund, we help clients model these values against their cost structure to estimate exactly how much credit they can generate annually and how to integrate that into long-term financing.

Here’s where things get fun. The 45X credit doesn’t just sit on your balance sheet—it can power your financing strategy.

You can:

Pre-sell credits to investors for upfront cash.

Use credits as collateral to secure loans.

Stack 45X with 48C (which offsets facility upgrade costs).

We once worked with a solar inverter manufacturer that used 45X projections as leverage to secure $30 million in expansion funding. Their bank called it “non-dilutive equity”—because it functioned like capital without selling ownership.

That’s the secret: treat your tax credits like financial assets, not paperwork.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit for growth isn’t just a policy—it’s a blueprint for scaling your business. If you’re producing clean energy components, this is your window to expand, secure funding, and dominate your sector.

At Icarus Fund, we specialize in turning clean energy tax credits into working capital that fuels real growth. From credit modeling to financing structures, we help manufacturers build the kind of financial foundation that scales fast and lasts long.",https://icarus-fund.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/45X-Advanced-Manufacturing-Credit-for-growth.webp,N,,2025-11-09 05:17:27.826425

Rajeev YSR, CEO of ThunderPlus, outlines how bidirectional charging, combined with innovations like ethanol-powered mobile rapid chargers, can stabilise grids, support off-grid areas, and accelerate India’s journey towards net-zero by 2070. He also highlights the policies, infrastructure, and industry collaboration needed to scale V2G nationwide.

Can V2G and bidirectional charging be a game-changer for renewable energy?

V2G and bidirectional charging are the natural evolution of India’s renewable journey. At ThunderPlus, we already operate 1,000+ chargers across 250 hubs, dispensing 10 MWh daily and recently introduced, with Trinity Cleantech and ME Energy, the world’s first 150 kW bioethanol-based mobile rapid charger cum generator. This grid-independent innovation produces energy from bioethanol and supports off-grid charging, closing a critical gap in India’s EV ecosystem. V2G takes this vision further by allowing EVs to return energy to the grid, balancing supply and demand in renewable-heavy regions. While current vehicle volumes limit scale, such technologies align with Hon. Minister Nitin Gadkari’s call for energy self-reliance and Atmanirbhar Bharat, turning every EV into a micro power plant.

What’s the potential impact of V2G on renewable energy and decarbonisation?

V2G has the potential to transform EVs into mobile renewable storage assets. ThunderPlus envisions its nationwide charging network as an ‘energy bank’ that balances solar and biofuel-based generation. Our collaboration with ME Energy, where ethanol powers a rapid charger to generate clean electricity anywhere, is a prototype of distributed renewable power. In the short term, V2G can support localised grids in fleet hubs and highway corridors; in the long term, it will help India achieve its net-zero by 2070 goal by offsetting peak-hour coal dependency. If even 15 percent of India’s EVs become V2G-enabled by 2030, they could unlock gigawatts of flexible capacity and significantly decarbonise transport and power simultaneously.

What steps are needed for integration of V2G-enabled EVs into the grid?

Three elements must align: standardisation, smart grid infrastructure, and pilot-scale commercialisation. ThunderPlus has already adopted OCPP 2.0 protocols and is working with utilities to test bidirectional communication and dynamic load management. Our ethanol-based mobile chargers demonstrate that clean energy can be generated and dispensed anywhere without grid dependency, a precursor to V2G deployment in rural and off-grid zones. We anticipate commercial V2G pilots by FY 2027-28, especially in industrial parks and fleet depots. Ultimately, each ThunderPlus hub is being engineered as a future-ready node for both energy delivery and energy return.

What type of government policies or incentives are required for V2G to work?

Policies should treat EVs as mobile energy assets, not just vehicles. India needs two-way metering, V2G tariffs, and renewable credit mechanisms to reward users feeding energy back to the grid. FAME-III can accelerate this through V2G pilot subsidies and tax incentives for bidirectional chargers. The ThunderPlus – ME Energy bio-ethanol charger is a live example of how innovation and policy can merge to build Atmanirbhar energy solutions. Government support for off-grid, renewable-based charging models will make India a global leader in sustainable energy mobility.

How can the auto industry overcome infrastructure and interoperability complexities?

Standardisation and collaboration are key. ThunderPlus has already integrated over 10 OEM technologies into one interoperable back-end platform across its network. Bi-directional chargers are currently 20–30 percent costlier, but as seen with our ethanol-powered rapid charger, localised manufacturing and indigenous innovation can drastically reduce costs. When EVs and charging infrastructure operate under open standards, economics improve through scale and shared energy revenue models. ThunderPlus is proving that sustainability and profitability can coexist by turning every parked vehicle and charging hub into an active participant in India’s energy transition.

What milestones and infrastructure developments are needed for mass adoption?

India’s next milestone is to link EV charging with energy generation. ThunderPlus and ME Energy’s bioethanol-based charger is the first step, offering rapid charging that is mobile, eco-friendly, and grid-independent. Over the next five years, ThunderPlus plans to expand V2G-ready hubs across all major corridors, integrated with solar and biofuel sources. National standards, utility integration, and open data infrastructure will be critical to scale this vision. Once EV penetration crosses 25 percent and renewable capacity is digitally managed, mass adoption of V2G will become a reality, making India’s mobility and energy systems mutually reinforcing.

What are the concerns about battery degradation?

Battery degradation is a valid concern, but technology is advancing faster than fear. Today’s batteries offer 2,000–3,000 cycles (8–10 years of use), and new chemistries like LFP and solid-state extend that significantly. ThunderPlus monitors battery health data from its charging network to optimise charging profiles and minimise wear. Our bio-ethanol chargers also enable controlled charging in areas without grid fluctuations, reducing stress on cells. By the time V2G reaches commercial scale, AI-driven battery management and better chemistries will ensure that battery life is not just preserved but enhanced through intelligent energy exchange.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/11/08/Untitled-design-4.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 01:58:17.385760

This first-come, first-served opportunity is being made available through Governor Pritzker’s bipartisan Rebuild Illinois capital plan for electric vehicle projects authorized under CEJA. Due to the first come, first served nature of this round of funding, Illinois EPA is posting the application materials today on Amplifund. This round will begin accepting applications on Monday, November 17, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. Central Time.

“Governor Pritzker has prioritized electrification of the transportation sector to improve air quality and benefit the health of our residents,” said Acting Director Jennings. “To support that priority, we are committed to expanding the charging infrastructure necessary to power current and future electric vehicles throughout Illinois.”

Each application for Level 3 chargers must include a minimum of two charging station locations. This NOFO will fund up to eight DCFC ports per location, and there is no limit on the number of Level 2 ports funded at a location. Eligible applicants must be an owner of a proposed charging station location and/or an owner of the proposed charging station. All applications must meet a minimum score to be eligible. Factors that are scored includes project readiness, location in a county where Illinois EPA has not previously funded projects, distance to public EV charging sites, and location at public transportation Park-and-Ride Facility.

Additional funding will also be awarded to projects at a charging station location in an area identified as an Equity Investment Eligible Community through the EIEC mapping tool. At that link, projects qualify for the additional points if they are in either an EJ or an R3 Community.

A map of the locations of EV charging stations funded by the State of Illinois to date is here: https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/1b71ab7f02cd424581ede5cdf28b37f6.

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products cost more and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front — especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules — cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the U.S. auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again — leaving the $1.6 trillion U.S. auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump’s Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect. That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations — but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the U.S. and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help U.S. car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s policies are costing drivers more

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don’t have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won’t come out until 2030 — when someone else will be in the White House.

The U.S. auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That’s why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond U.S. shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the U.S. and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LinesofCars.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-09 04:58:16.531693

The paper, titled Re-anchoring CBDR-RC in Human Development and SDGs for Climate Justice, redefines the global climate discourse by linking human development and energy consumption to operationalize equity and justice. Authored by Dr Shailly Kedia, Senior Fellow, TERI, with contributions from Pujeet Jha, Researcher, TERI School of Advanced Studies, and reviewed by Mr RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, and former Principal Negotiator for Climate Change at the UNFCCC, the study offers a measurable approach to the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)—a cornerstone of the UNFCCC.

The paper notes that 10 years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement and the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the balance between climate ambition and development remains uneven. Global focus has tilted toward emissions metrics, while the developmental foundations of climate justice–equity, capability, and human well-being–have receded to the background. The study establishes a strong empirical linkage between human development and energy access, showing that energy poverty is human poverty. Without reliable and affordable power, no country can provide healthcare, education, or livelihoods.

Using the 2000-Watt Society as a benchmark, the paper sets a sustainable and equitable energy use goal of 2000 watts (48 kWh per day) per person—aligning efficiency and sufficiency with quality of life. It argues that this benchmark can anchor SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) while linking energy sufficiency to dignity and development.

India’s per capita energy consumption currently stands at 866 watts—less than half the sustainable benchmark—while high-income economies average more than 6,000 watts. The paper highlights that achieving climate justice demands addressing both underconsumption in developing countries and overconsumption in high-income countries. To operationalize CBDR-RC, the study maps 187 countries based on their per capita energy consumption and Human Development Index (HDI) levels, classifying them into eight zones—each representing a different stage in the balance between development and sustainability.

The framework transforms equity from a static principle into a dynamic, measurable tool, enabling countries to pursue differentiated yet complementary trajectories:

Zone 1 (68 countries): Very high HDI and excessive energy consumption, including the United States, Canada, Japan, and many EU countries. These countries must lead deep decarbonization and support developing countries through means of implementation especially finance and technology.

Zone 2 (15 countries): Emerging economies such as China, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia, which must balance human development with decoupling growth from emissions.

Zone 3 (2 countries): Medium-HDI countries nearing balance between energy use and human development.

Zone 4 (no country): No low-HDI country has high energy consumption, underscoring the absence of overconsumption among the poor.

Zone 5 (26 countries): Low human development and extremely low per capita energy consumption, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These countries face severe energy poverty and high vulnerability.

Zone 6 (40 countries): Lower-middle-income countries such as India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria. These countries must expand energy access for development while staying within sustainable limits.

Zone 7 (33 countries): High-HDI countries with moderate energy use that remain vulnerable and should strive for resilience.

Zone 8 (3 countries): Albania, Costa Rica, and North Macedonia, which have achieved very high HDI with relatively low energy consumption.

This HDI–Energy Zoning Framework provides a scientific and ethical foundation for a Zone of Climate Justice, where sustainable energy use and high human development coexist.

The study traces the evolution of CBDR-RC from static differentiation under the UNFCCC to self-differentiation under the Paris Agreement. However, it warns that this evolution has diluted the operational meaning of equity.

By integrating data on energy and HDI, the paper redefines CBDR-RC as a living principle—capable of evolving with changing capacities and responsibilities.

As the world approaches COP30, TERI calls for re-anchoring climate cooperation in equity, responsibility, and shared prosperity. Incremental pledges alone will not achieve just transitions; the coming decade must bridge climate ambition and human development.

Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI, said: “COP30 needs to recognize that equity and just transitions cannot be achieved through incremental pledges. It demands a re-anchoring of global cooperation in the principles of equity, responsibility, and shared prosperity through human development and equitable clean energy access.”

Mr RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, and former Principal Negotiator for Climate Change at the UNFCCC observed: “This paper is an attempt to define the principle of equity and CBDR and differentiate nations based on their share in per capita energy consumption which is closely linked to SDGs. It gives an ethical basis of actions under the Paris Agreement.”

Dr Shailly Kedia, Senior Fellow, TERI, added: “Energy poverty is human poverty. Access to reliable and affordable power is fundamental to healthcare, education, and livelihoods. This paper calls for re-anchoring climate justice through Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), anchored in human development and equitable energy use within a Zone of Climate Justice.”

As the paper concludes, “A climate regime divorced from development cannot deliver justice, and development pathways divorced from planetary limits cannot deliver sustainability.”

In a letter to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the groups called on the regulator to require price disclosure on the cost of trucks and for manufacturers to publish prices at least twice annually. The submission adds that truck prices “are negotiated behind closed doors, and vary widely between buyers”, giving “manufacturers extraordinary market power—allowing them to extract higher prices from public programs and private fleets alike, with little accountability.""

California’s Clean Truck & Bus Vouchers program has allocated $1.7 billion to date.

A study conducted this year by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) showed the cost of electric Class 8 heavy trucks in the U.S. jumped by 27% ($87,100) between 2020 and 2025, while the cost of a similar truck in Europe fell by 23%.

The median price of a model year 2024 battery-electric heavy-duty tractor truck in the United States, according to ICCT, is $379,800—roughly 2.5 times the price of a combustion engine tractor. In China, the median price of the same class and type of vehicle is $119,600.

“Opaque pricing has become the norm, distorting competition, undermining public trust, and limiting the ability of small fleets and independent owner operators to participate in the clean vehicle transition,” the groups charged in their submission to CARB.

In a letter to New York Governor Kathy Hochul with recommendations for the state’s Interagency Working Group to Accelerate Clean Vehicle Adoption, a coalition of advocates including Earthjustice, Alliance for Clean Energy New York, and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign call for “pricing clarity and market fairness.""

“To ensure public funds are efficiently deployed, New York should explore requiring full price disclosure as a condition of receiving state incentive funds,” the submission added.

Both Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council also submitted comments in response to a public dialogue period on Washington state’s ZEVergreen Initiative, calling on Washington Department of Ecology to adopt similar measures to promote price transparency in truck sales.

Complicated path to zero

Trucking's path to zero emissions is currently being litigated.

Just minutes after President Donald Trump signed in June a trio of resolutions that ended California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) electric vehicle mandates and strict diesel-emissions standards, the state doubled down on its commitment to clean cars and trucks.

Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order further advancing California’s clean vehicle transition and kickstarting development of next-generation policy to spur innovation, updating state vehicle purchasing requirements, and directing the state to develop new actions to accelerate affordable clean vehicle adoption.

U.S. District Judge Dena Coggins last week issued a preliminary injunction barring California from enforcing the terms of the Clean Truck Partnership CARB signed with truck and engine manufacturers. Daimler Truck North America (DTNA), PACCAR, International Motors, and Volvo Group North America (VGNA) sought an injunction in a lawsuit filed in August, arguing that when President Donald Trump in June walked back Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency waivers relating to California's Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulations and its Omnibus Low NOx (Omnibus) rule, it also voided the CTP.

In September, CARB submitted comments opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) push to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding, noting that the EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/11/4gen-logistics-vnr-electric-customer-event.DQfn1dnhgi.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-08 20:59:11.632221

Speaking at the Energy Transition Roundtable during the Belém Climate Summit on November 7, he said last year 90 per cent of new power capacity came from renewables.

""Global investment in clean energy reached two trillion US dollars - eight hundred billion more than fossil fuels,"" Guterres said. ""Renewables are now the cheapest source of new electricity in nearly every country. They are powering prosperity and empowering communities long left in the dark.""

He highlighted the economic impact of clean energy, noting that every dollar invested in renewables creates three times more jobs than a dollar invested in fossil fuels. ""Clean energy jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs worldwide. The renewables revolution is here,"" he said.

""But we must go much faster - and ensure all nations share the benefits,"" Guterres added.

At COP28, countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly, and equitable manner; to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. ""The mandate is clear - now we must close the delivery gap,"" the UN chief said.

He warned that even if all new national commitments are fully implemented, the world is still on track for more than 2°C of warming, resulting in more floods, heat, and suffering worldwide. Scientists now say overshooting 1.5°C is inevitable, starting at the latest in the early 2030s. How high and how long the overshoot lasts, he said, depends on the speed and scale of global action today.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres outlined five key actions to accelerate the global energy transition. He called for clarity and coherence, urging countries to align laws, policies, and incentives with a just energy transition while eliminating fossil fuel subsidies that distort markets.

Guterres emphasised the need to put people and equity at the centre of the transition. He said workers and communities dependent on coal, oil, and gas must be supported with training, protection, and new opportunities, especially for young people and women.

He highlighted the importance of infrastructure investment, noting that grids, storage, and efficiency must be expanded rapidly to keep pace with the surging growth of renewable energy.

The UN chief also stressed that all new electricity demand must be met with clean power, including the energy used by data centres driving the AI revolution. Technology, he said, must be part of the solution, not a new source of strain.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","(The Hill) – In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and 710 will be temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announced layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://www.ksn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2025/11/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330-e1762374307401.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-09 12:19:23.690934

In some states, these state-managed insurance plans have grown from a handful of policies, as originally intended, to hundreds of thousands of homeowners.
In California, the FAIR Plan reached its breaking point following the January wildfires that devastated Los Angeles.
After the plan's reserves were exhausted, state regulators imposed a $1 billion assessment on insurance companies in the state.
""The private market isn't going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times.","In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Californians have purchased home insurance from a state-managed ""last resort"" insurance pool that has grown rapidly as private insurance companies have fled the market.

Now, in the wake of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan is seeking approval from the state for an average 36% rate hike, which would further squeeze homeowners who have no other options for coverage.

Insurance experts say it's a national warning sign, as the effects of climate change cause private insurance companies to pull back on coverage in disaster-prone areas, leaving states and their residents to assume more of the risk. Fewer homeowners will be able to purchase private insurance in the future, and even those who do may face higher premiums as companies charge more to pay for the FAIR Plan losses.

In some states, these state-managed insurance plans have grown from a handful of policies, as originally intended, to hundreds of thousands of homeowners. The plans charge high premiums and provide limited coverage.

""It was supposed to be a stopgap measure. People are supposed to be on a FAIR Plan policy for a short amount of time, but with climate change and these extreme weather events, that's not going to happen,"" said Alfonso Pating, global financial regulation analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit.

At present, 35 states and the District of Columbia offer FAIR Plans or Citizens Plans to home-owners who can't find coverage on the private market. The plans are managed by state governments, with the financial backing of the private insurers doing business in that state.

The plans maintain enough reserves to cover payouts for an average year. But when the plans take heavy losses, they impose an assessment on a pool of the insurance companies doing business in the state, based on their market share.

These state-managed plans were initially created to cover a small number of properties as a temporary, last-resort option. But now, as wildfires and hurricanes have pushed insurance companies to retreat from certain areas, FAIR Plans cover nearly 3 million properties nationwide, with an exposure exceeding $1 trillion, according to data issued last year by the Insurance Information Institute.

""If it's going to keep on growing, it becomes impossible to manage the risk,"" Douglas Heller, director of insurance with the Consumer Federation of America, a research and advocacy nonprofit, said in an interview earlier this year. ""It's OK if the high risk is just a small pool, but if the private sector is unwilling to take any of the highrisk [policies], that model doesn't work anymore.""

In California, the FAIR Plan reached its breaking point following the January wildfires that devastated Los Angeles. In the months before the fires, insurance companies had dropped coverage in many neighborhoods of the city, causing the state-backed insurer to take on policies covering billions of dollars.

The FAIR Plan was hit with $4 billion in losses when the fires wiped out many of the properties that had recently turned to the plan for coverage. After the plan's reserves were exhausted, state regulators imposed a $1 billion assessment on insurance companies in the state. Some of those companies received permission to impose a surcharge on all their customers, residents not covered by the FAIR Plan, totaling more than $150 million so far, according to the Los Angeles Times.

This mechanism, which allows an assessment on all insurance policyholders in a state to make a state-managed plan solvent again, is known in Florida as the ""hurricane tax.""

In the wake of the California wildfires, the FAIR Plan is seeking an average 36% rate hike on homeowners in the plan, which the insurance pool says is necessary to keep up with the growing risks.

FAIR Plans typically provide only bare-bones coverage, and California's plan is facing lawsuits over its smoke damage policy. Now, the homeowners who rely on that plan could be facing much higher premiums for their coverage.

Some observers say the dire situation in California shows the unsustainable path many states are on as more and more residents lose coverage on the private market. California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts and North Carolina all have more than 100,000 properties insured by their state plans, according to the Insurance Information Institute's data.

A report authored by Pating, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, described a potential ""cycle of doom"" in which FAIR Plans assume more and more risk, taking heavy losses as climate change-driven weather events batter their states. Under this scenario, when the plans are forced to charge assessments on private insurers to replenish their reserves, more insurance companies retreat from doing business in the state, pushing even more residents on to the FAIR Plan.

""You'll see continued growth of these policies,"" Pating said. ""The private market isn't going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times. Every time an event happens, it's just going to get worse and worse.""

Pating called on states to use their FAIR Plans to incentivize hazard mitigation work — lowering premiums for property owners and communities who take steps to protect themselves from storms and wildfires. He said state regulators should also require more transparency from insurers about where they're dropping policies and raising premiums, which would help state officials better understand the risks.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 01:18:35.016085

Indiana to Host Advanced Small Reactor Energy Park

First American Nuclear and the State of Indiana Introduce the First “closed-fuel cycle” Nuclear Energy Park in the U.S.

Reprocessing and Reusing Spent Fuel Will Take Place Onsite Using a Fast Neutron Reactor

First American Nuclear (FANCO), developer of a fast-spectrum small modular reactor (SMR) and the State of Indiana announced this week plans to establish Indiana as the home of the company’s headquarters, manufacturing facilities, and an energy park to position the state at the forefront of U.S. global leadership in sustainable nuclear technology.

The location of the plant and a time line for construction and operation were not announced. FACNO is based in Richland, WA. The firm did not name any investors or other forms of financial backing.

Fast Reactor Breeder Design

According to the press statement, the energy park is designed to be the first to operate in a “closed-fuel cycle” meaning it will reprocess and reuse spent nuclear fuel on-site, eliminating 97% of long-lasting nuclear waste. The 240 MWe EAGL-1 reactor can also create more fuel than it burns, setting the stage for nuclear energy to be deemed not only clean, but renewable. The firm states on its website thatEAGL-1 operates in the fast neutron spectrum.

The firm did not provide technical details of what form the spent fuel would be in as received by the reactor. A reference to UO2 fuel on the firm’s website, intended to avoid the HALEU shortage, suggests the spent fuel would be derived from light water reactors. The claim that the reactor would produce more fuel than it burned indicates it is a “fast breeder” type reactor, as noted on the firm’s website, and that the fuel it would produce would be plutonium.

According to the World Nuclear Association, A 1,000 MWe light water reactor gives produces to about 25 tonnes of used fuel a year, containing up to 290 kilograms of plutonium. If the plutonium is extracted from used reactor fuel it can be used as a direct substitute for U-235, the PU-239 being the main fissile part.

Plutonium can be used in fast neutron reactors, where a much higher proportion of PU-239 fissions and in fact all the plutonium isotopes fission, and so function as a fuel. As with uranium, the energy potential of plutonium is more fully realized in a fast reactor.

Lead-Bismuth Coolant

FANCO’s flagship technology design, the EAGL-1 SMR, will use a liquid metal alloy called lead bismuth. The profile of FANCO founders on the company website indicate they have worked with sodium, molten salt, pressurized water, and high-temperature gas coolants for decades.

The team says in the press statement that the firm is convinced that lead bismuth solves the technical challenges to delivering safe, commercial-scale nuclear energy at an affordable price. The EAGL-1 design generates 240 MWe of electricity. The firm plans to offer the reactor in a “six-pack” cluster for total of 1,470 MW equivalent to an South Korean 1,400 MW PWR.

According to FANCO lead bismuth cooler “is a game-changer.” Due to the benign chemical properties of lead bismuth, EAGL-1 does not require complex safety systems using exotic materials. The EAGL-1 design will be manufactured and assembled in the U.S. TYhe firm did not indicate the site for the facotory not a timeline for its construction.

Economic Effects of the Project

“Indiana and First American Nuclear joining forces to improve the quality of life for Hoosiers and the American people was an easy decision to make,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources.

“FANCO has the ability to deliver affordable, sustainable power to light up our rooms, keep us warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and rise to the ever-increasing energy demands of an advanced manufacturing and computing economy.”

In addition to tapping into Indiana’s existing workforce, First American Nuclear will develop a comprehensive program to attract and retain talent through partnerships with Indiana’s technical colleges and Universities, including tailored curricula, certifications, and apprenticeships. The program is expected to build a pipeline of highly skilled local workers to support the manufacturing and operations of EAGL-1 nuclear components, and the deployment of these systems across the U.S. and for export.

Purdue, BWXT Forge Strategic Collaboration To Advance Nuclear Innovation

Agreement establishes framework for joint research, technology development and student opportunities

Purdue University and BWX Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BWXT), a leading manufacturer and supplier of nuclear components and services for the commercial and government sectors, have signed a memorandum of understanding to forge a research relationship focused on next-generation nuclear manufacturing, including small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors.

Through collaborative research and innovation, this agreement advances technical abilities and knowledge regarding nuclear energy that is essential to addressing growing energy demand, the economic resilience of the country, national defense and global security.

Purdue President Mung Chiang and Suzy Sterner, BWXT senior vice president and chief corporate affairs officer, signed the agreement on 10/23/25 in Washington, D.C.

“This partnership marks a transformative moment for Purdue and the future of nuclear energy innovation,” Chiang said.

“By aligning our nationally recognized engineering programs with cutting-edge nuclear technologies, like small modular reactors, we’re not only advancing research — we’re also preparing the next generation of scientists, engineers and policy leaders to meet the energy and workforce demands of tomorrow.”

The agreement outlines academic opportunities to advance career development for Purdue students and the broader nuclear workforce through:

Separately, Purdue was awarded a $6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy in June 2024 to lead a consortium that will revitalize nuclear research facilities and expand university-led research for SMR and AR technologies. In May 2024, Purdue was selected by the state of Indiana to assess the feasibility of deploying SMRs in Indiana. Results of the study were announced in February 2025.

“This agreement between Purdue and BWXT further strengthens our state’s position as a leader in energy innovation and technology-driven economic growth,” said Jon Ford, executive director of the Indiana Office of Energy Development.

“With the growing footprint of a digital economy drawing upon the electric grid, partnerships like this are essential to ensuring we have the skilled workforce and advanced energy systems to support them.”

Constellation Plans to Double Capacity of Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant

(WNN) With energy demands forecast to increase sharply in the coming decades, Constellation said it “will explore building 2,000 MW of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.”

Most likely, this would involve two units in the range of 1,000 MW. The firm did not announce a timeline for these investments in new reactors nor specifics about their design or power ratings.

Calvert Cliffs is composed of two PWRs – one of 863 MW and the other 855 MW. The plans for the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center include 20-year life extensions for the nuclear two units which would otherwise shut down in 2034 and 2036.

Constellation also said it can invest in uprates to increase the two pressurised water reactors’ current 1,790 capacity by a further 190 MW. Calvert Cliffs is Maryland’s only nuclear power plant and produces about 40% of Maryland’s total power generation and 80% of the state’s clean power generation. The company says its combined plans could lead to the US state’s clean energy share increasing from 50% to 70%.

The company also announced it is considering development of an 800 MW battery storage project and 700 MW of gas-fired generation plant that could be switched to hydrogen fuel in the future,

Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, said: “Today, we announce an ambitious plan to make billions of dollars of new investments in Maryland without seeking any electricity rate increases, including options ranging from new natural gas to battery storage and nuclear energy.”

Terrestrial Energy, Westinghouse Sign Fuel Deal at Springfields, UK Plant

Agreement encompasses deconversion, fabrication, packaging, and transportation services for Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) fuel production, paving the way for pilot plant construction

Partnership with Westinghouse’s Springfield Fuels advances Terrestrial Energy’s Western supply chain strategy while accelerating IMSR commercialization pathway

Terrestrial Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:IMSR), a developer of small modular nuclear power plants using its Generation IV reactor technology, announced this week it has signed a manufacturing and supply contract with Springfields Fuels Limited, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Company for the design and construction of an Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) fuel pilot plant.

The agreement serves as a significant advancement of Terrestrial Energy’s fuel supply chain capabilities in support of the company’s accelerating commercialization pathway, with construction set to begin in 2026.

The agreement, building on a contract signed in August 2023 for the planning and initial design of IMSR fuel supply, leverages established deconversion and fuel manufacturing infrastructure at Westinghouse’s Springfields nuclear fuel manufacturing site in Preston, UK, to support Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR deployment strategy.

The expanded scope includes a wide range of commercial-scale fuel services, such as deconversion, fabrication, packaging and transportation. Upon completion of the pilot plant, the facility will be positioned to scale to commercial fuel production for a future fleet of IMSR Plants.

Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR plant uses next-generation molten salt reactor technology – a Generation IV nuclear technology – to deliver high-temperature thermal energy. This energy supports highly efficient steam turbine operation, low-cost electricity generation and direct thermal energy supply for industrial use.

Unique among North American Generation IV designs, the IMSR is fueled with low-cost, readily available Standard Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (SALEU) fuel, uranium enriched to under 5% uranium-235, allowing for alignment with Springfields role as a supplier of SALEU as uranium oxide fuel to commercial nuclear power reactors.

Terrestrial Energy’s use of low enriched uranium fuel, e.g., less than 5% U235, the only commercially available reactor fuel on the market today, for IMSR plant operation shields the firm from substantial supply challenges associated with the use of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium fuel (HALEU), which have been exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and the current lack of commercial-scale supply in the U.S. market.

A key innovation in the pilot plant design is a re-optimized chemical process to supply UF4 deconverted from UF6 at 5% enrichment. Today’s industry standard is the deconversion of UF6 at 5% enrichment supplied from enrichment plants to uranium oxide fuel. The process to deconvert to UF4 is optimized with the pilot plant design enabling the large-scale fuel supply required for IMSR fleet deployment by leveraging Springfields’ existing commercial scale infrastructure.

Separatrely, Terrestrial Energy as the company is pursuing its first IMSR deployment at site in the U.S. including at Texas A&M’s RELLIS campus. Also, the company was selected for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy’s Advanced Reactor Pilot Program, as well as the U.S. DOE Office of Nuclear Energy’s Fuel Line Pilot Program. Together, these programs provide a pathway to significantly accelerate Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR commercialization.

EDF Sets Goal of Producing 30 SMRs for Export by 2050

Reuters reports that state-owned French power utility EDF expects to complete the conceptual design of a small modular reactor (SMR) next year. The plan is to produce up to 30 SMRs according to a press statement by Julien Garrel, CEO of small modular reactor division Nuward.

While EDF did not provide details on the new design, it is assumed that it will based on light water reactors. EDF plans to offer the SMRs for export to provide power to energy intensive industries and data centers.

This is a reboot of an earlier effort that was shelved in July 2024 when EDF scrapped plans for a unique design approach. A source at Nuward told Reuters at the time the decision to go back to the drawing board on SMR development came after talks with prospective utility clients such as Sweden’s Vattenfall, the Czech Republic’s CEZ, and Finland’s Fortum, who are examining investments in both Generation III full-size nuclear plants and SMRs.

The key issues revolve around the cost of electricity that would be provided by the SMR based on its construction costs. The design at that time involved twin 170 MWe units attached to a single turbine.

The first prototype based on the new design is expected to be online in 2035, followed by one reactor annually until it has four in two countries. The new reactor is expected to offer customers 400 MWe of power and 115 MW of process heat. These numbers put it in the same general class as the Rollys-Royce 470 MW PWR which is being developed in the UK for both domestic and international customers.

Reuters reported that EDF said the costs and conceptual design are set to coincide with EDF’s final investment decision on its fleet of six large-scale EPR2 reactors for its home market, which the company plans to deliver by the second half of 2026.

Framatome to Produce TRISO Fuel in France for Advanced Reactors

Framatome announced the launch of new industrialization and development capabilities for TRISO fuel at its Romans-sur-Isère site in France. This initiative complements Framatome’s ongoing activities in the United States and marks a significant expansion of the company’s resources in France, with the installation of a pilot line dedicated to manufacturing various types of TRISO fuel for advanced reactor projects, including high-temperature reactors (HTR).

The new pilot line will focus on the production of TRISO (tristructural isotropic) fuel enriched up to 20%. This facility will enable the specification and qualification of TRISO fuel, as well as the associated manufacturing and quality control processes. The project is designed to pave the way for future industrialization of TRISO fuel in France.

Triso (TRi-structural ISOtropic) nuclear fuel is a highly robust, advanced fuel form for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. It consists of a uranium-based fuel kernel surrounded by three distinct layers of ceramic and carbon materials, which form an individual containment system for each particle.

This tri-structural design is said to provide exceptional resistance to corrosion, high temperatures, and irradiation, making it impossible to melt under extreme conditions and containing radioactive fission products effectively.

Nuclear Startup Blue Capsule in TRISO Fuel Deal With Framatome

(NucNet) France-based advanced nuclear reactor startup Blue Capsule Technology has announced an agreement to advance their cooperation on fuel with French company Framatome. The company said the term sheet agreement covers qualification of Triso fuel particles for Blue Capsule. It also includes manufacturing of fuel elements for the Blue Capsule high-temperature reactor.

Framatome has said it plans launch new industrialization and development capabilities for Triso fuel at its Romans-sur-Isère site in southern France.

“Blue Capsule’s high-temperature reactor (HTR) project has taken an important step forward with Framatome,” said the company’s president Edouard Hourcade. The firm notes its design has a heritage of work that took place in the 1960s

“Our HTR project is based on the idea that France, and Europe, with its world-class nuclear industry, needs a robust supply chain to best achieve its goal.”

The company said it aimed to deploy low-enriched Triso fuel at less than 5% in its reactors, citing the wide use of low-enriched uranium in the industry, and the export potential of reactors that use LEU.

Blue Capsule is targeting energy-intensive industries, given that its HTR will produce industrial-grade heat and steam, and electricity if needed.

Blue Capsule said these products are particularly suited for industry clusters and “inside-the-fence” industrial users such as the cement and alumina sectors, soda ash or steelmaking, or even synthetic fuel or hydrogen synthesis.

The company’s sodium-cooled plant is engineered to provide up to 150 MWth of heat at 700°C in the form of hot air, steam up to 650°C, or up to 50 MW of electricity.

China Announces Thorium-Uranium Conversion Breakthrough At Gobi Desert Experimental Reactor

(NucNet) An experimental reactor developed in the Gobi Desert by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics has achieved thorium-to-uranium fuel conversion. The achievement makes the 2 MW liquid-fuelled thorium-based molten salt reactor (TMSR) the only operating example of the technology in the world to have successfully loaded and used thorium fuel. The reactor, known as TMSR-LF1, came online in June 2024. It follows a sodium-cooled version – the TMSR-SF.

According to the academy, the experiment has provided initial proof of the technical feasibility of using thorium resources in molten salt reactor systems and represents a major leap forward for the technology.

According to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, quoting a report by Science and Technology Daily – the official newspaper of the Ministry of Science and Technology – it is the first time that scientists have been able to acquire experimental data on thorium operations from inside a molten salt reactor.

The Science and Technology Daily article, published on 11/01/25, was China’s first official confirmation of its success in the development of TMSR technology.

The TMSR-LF stream claims it is a full closed Th-U fuel cycle with breeding of U-233 and much better sustainability with thorium but greater technical difficulty. It is optimized for utilization of thorium with electrometallurgical pyroprocessing. The Fluorine design follows the sodium cooled design by about a decade. (January 2017 Gen IV Briefing – PDF file)

Some of the work on the TMSR series is based on collaboration between the Chinese Academy of Science’s (CAS) Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP) and the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) via a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to accelerate the development of fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactors (FHRs). This work took place in 2015-2016.

How the Process Works

At the heart of the breakthrough is a process known as in-core thorium-to-uranium conversion that transforms naturally occurring thorium-232 into uranium-233, which is a fissile isotope capable of sustaining nuclear chain reactions.

This transformation occurs through a precise sequence of nuclear reactions. The thorium-232 absorbs a neutron to become thorium-233, which decays into protactinium-233 and then further decays into the final product – a powerful nuclear fuel.

Critically, the entire process takes place inside the reactor core, eliminating the need for external fuel fabrication.

Thorium is dissolved in a fluoride salt into a high-temperature molten mixture which serves as both fuel and coolant. Neutrons from a small initial charge of fissile material, such as enriched uranium-235 or plutonium-239, initiate the chain reaction.

Throughout the operation, thorium-232 continuously captures neutrons and transforms into uranium-233, which then releases energy through nuclear fission to create a self-sustaining “burn while breeding” cycle – one of the technology’s defining advantages.

Thorium is much more abundant and accessible than uranium and has enormous energy potential. One mine tailings site in Inner Mongolia is estimated to hold enough of the element to power China entirely for more than 1,000 years, reports said.

Refuelling Can Be ‘On The Fly’

Unlike conventional pressurized water reactors, which must be shut down periodically to open the pressure vessel and replace solid fuel rods, the TMSR’s liquid fuel – a homogeneous mixture of fissile material dissolved in molten salt – circulates continuously, allowing for “on-the-fly” refuelling without interrupting operations.

Another advantage of the TMSR is that it requires no water at all, in sharp contrast to conventional nuclear power plants that are usually built near coastlines because of their massive cooling needs. This is a plus for a reactor located in the Gobi desert in the landlocked province of Gansu, in the north of the country near the Mongolian border.

Energy Department Seeks Proposals for AI Data Centers, Energy Projects at Paducah, KY

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management issued a Request for Offer on 11/04/25 seeking proposals from companies to build and power AI data centers on DOE’s Paducah site.

The Paducah site is one of four sites identified by the Department for AI infrastructure and generation projects on federal land. EM is now seeking proposals from U.S. companies to potentially enter into one or more long-term leasing agreements at the site that would be solely funded by the applicants.

DOE Assistant Secretary for the Office of Environmental Management Tim Walsh said, “Paducah has the resources and vision to support the next generation of AI infrastructure, creating new opportunities for prosperity while advancing national security for future generations.”

Applicants will be responsible for building, operating, and decommissioning each infrastructure project and must secure utility interconnection agreements. Proposals will be competitively evaluated for technological readiness, financial viability, and detailed plans to complete regulatory and permitting requirements.

DOE will post future dates for proposal submittal and a sponsored industry day event for applicants to learn more about the solicitation process and requirements outlined in the RFO, and tour the sites available for consideration. Check SAM.GOV for details.

About the Paducah Site

The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) was constructed in 1952 to produce enriched uranium, initially for the nation’s nuclear weapons program and later for nuclear fuel for commercial power plants. The plant is owned by the Department of Energy (DOE), which oversees environmental cleanup activities at the site, including environmental remediation, waste management, depleted uranium conversion, and decontamination and decommissioning.

Commercial enrichment was conducted under lease from 1993 until 2013 when operations ceased and the gaseous diffusion facilities were returned to the DOE Environmental Management (EM) program. EM has conducted extensive cleanup activities at the site since the late 1980s and is currently deactivating the returned plant facilities while continuing the aggressive remediation program being managed by its Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office.

The DRA’s assessment for Merrimack Station used a methodology different than the town’s and produced a vastly different value.","By GARRY RAYNO, Distant Dome

Anyone who travelled I-89 or I-93 in the winter months near the Capital City, would see a large white plume of smoke rising out of Merrimack Station, the coal-burning electric generating plant in Bow.

At one time, the plant produced a large percentage of the electricity used by Public Service of New Hampshire’s customers along with Seabrook Station.

In those days, the plant’s location along the Merrimack River was the prime reason Bow’s property taxes were much lower than surrounding communities.

While the plant required the town to have more fire fighting equipment, and more expensive ladder trucks than it needed for the rest of the town, the property taxes PSNH and in turn its customers paid, kept Bow’s tax rate among the lowest in the Capital region.

But as coal became a less acceptable fuel for generating electricity and heating homes and businesses due to its greenhouse gas emissions accelerating global warming and climate change, the plant ran less and less and for the past decade or so has been a “peaker,” only used when the electric demand is high and the usual less expensive sources of electricity cannot produce enough to satisfy the need.

In its last half dozen years, the plant ran at less than eight percent of its capacity compared to 70 and 80 percent 20 years ago.

The plant last ran in September and is now officially shut down by its owner Granite Shore Power, which intends to convert the facility into a renewable energy park with large battery storage.

The plant was scheduled to shut down in 2028 under an agreement with the Conservation Law Foundation, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Protection Agency due to Clean Water Act violations from its cooling system

The plant also failed an emission test in recent years.

Merrimack Station was the last coal-fired generating plant in New England, and with its closure, coal emissions no longer fill New England skies to generate electricity.

The environmental benefits of moving away from coal are clear, but the slow reduction in use and now the closure are also examples of the complexities of the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund the vast majority of government in the state from Concord down to water precincts.

Several recent studies show what New Hampshire property owners already know, that the state’s property tax rates and collections are among the highest in the nation.

New Hampshire recently ranked fourth highest in the country for effective property tax rate behind only New Jersey, Illinois and Connecticut.

New Hampshire property owners pay the third highest median property taxes.

And New Hampshire is number one in the nation in collecting state and local property taxes.

The foundation of property taxes is the assessment and how it is determined.

Property taxes are assessed on the value of the land you own and the value of the building or buildings.

No one would argue the value of Merrimack Station goes down with the move from full-time energy supplier to peaker, but how?

The value of the land hasn’t changed. Its potential for development along the shores of the Merrimack River probably increased with the plant’s shutdown.

And the buildings and their use have not changed and still have the capacity to produce lots of energy if ever the coal rail cars begin traveling to Bow again.

To see what can happen in this convoluted property tax system, you only have to look to the turn of the century when state lawmakers cobbled together an education funding plan that included a statewide education property tax and a state utility property tax. The plan was the legislature’s answer to the State Supreme Court’s Claremont decisions.

The state utility property tax was a direct hit on communities that hosted generating plants like Bow, Seabrook, Portsmouth and Newington.

While Portsmouth and Newington were able to survive the added expense because of the communities’ total property value, it transformed Bow and Seabrook from donor communities into receiver towns overnight.

At the time, the town of Bow had recently won a court case filed by PSNH objecting to the method the town used to assess Merrimack Station. It would later lose a similar case.

But when the state instituted its utility property tax, the Department of Revenue Administration decided what the assessments would be for poles, wires, transformers and yes the generating plants.

The DRA’s assessment for Merrimack Station used a methodology different than the town’s and produced a vastly different value.

With the two assessments tens of millions of dollars apart, PSNH threatened to sue the town unless it dropped its assessment down to the state’s.

A three-year step down agreement was reached to soften the blow to property taxpayers.

When the statewide property tax and the utility tax went into effect, the town of Bow lost multiple millions of dollars of its tax revenue to the state’s coffers.

Without making draconian cuts to schools or town services, those millions of now state dollars were downshifted to the local property taxpayers by the legislature’s actions.

I owned a home in Bow at the time and my property tax bill was a steady $1,500 a year.

In the next three years, my tax bill skyrocketed to over $6,000 a year and it kept going up as the value of Merrimack Station went down.

The town of Bow did not raise my property taxes 400 percent, the state of New Hampshire did as they did to every property owner in Bow, and most likely Seabrook as well. Portsmouth’s and Newington’s tax base softened the blow a little bit in those communities.

The value of my property did not change, if anything it went down because the community was no longer as desirable a place to live because the property taxes were no longer reasonable.

Just prior to this happening Bow had decided to build its own high school and leave Concord High School when the Concord School Board decided to increase Bow’s payments to attend the high school.

When the residents of Bow decided to build their own high school, they had no idea a few years later the state would manipulate the property tax system for its own benefit and drastically increase the property taxes for Bow residents and businesses.

A similar situation is developing with lawmakers messing around with local planning and zoning ordinances in the name of affordable housing after years of master plans being developed and approved, but now the state legislature knows best.

The same people who rail against the “state knows best” when it comes to civil rights or public education are leading the charge to loosen zoning and planning regulations.

There is a long history of the state changing the equation from school funding to the victims of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of state employers at the Sununu Youth Services Center or the governor’s take over of the sale of the former Laconia School property.

What does not change, is things never work to the advantage of communities negatively impacted by the state’s heavy hand on the scales.

The aim is simple, but lofty: for countries to work together to stop the worst effects of human-caused climate change.

That's a goal many experts say is slipping out of reach. But the stakes are high. Climate change is already escalating disasters that mean life or death for billions of people around the world, and delaying action will only worsen the problem.

Here's what you need to know about COP30.

A spotlight is on Indigenous peoples, forests and agriculture

With the world's largest rainforest on its doorstep, many have lauded Belem as well-positioned to highlight the role of Indigenous peoples and land stewardship in addressing climate change.

Although many past COPs have primarily focused on transitioning to cleaner energy sources, research has shown that shifting food systems is also a must. Countries also need to stop destroying the ecosystems that suck up pollution and protect humans from diseases.

The government of Brazil is spearheading a new initiative called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a program designed to give nations a monetary reward for protecting forests. It remains to be seen whether world leaders will pledge enough money to make the project a success.

Getting there — and staying there — has been a challenge for many

Before the conference, many would-be attendees worried about whether the city could host tens of thousands of people. Delegates have booked rooms on cruise ships in the harbor. Others are staying in by-the-hour “love motels,"" and some activists said they might camp out.

The weather is expected to be oppressively hot and humid, and as such the host country has already written to attendees to make the dress code a little more informal.

But some experts and locals say any discomfort is a much-needed reality check, especially for those coming from rich countries. The government of Brazil was adamant that the conference needed to be in Belem to showcase what's at stake: Poorer communities are often more vulnerable to disasters worsened by climate change.

A decade since the historic Paris Agreement, countries are off course

Ten years ago, countries made a historic deal in the first global pact to fight climate change.

Since then, the planet’s annual temperature has already jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit), one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. The Paris Agreement was supposed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the historical average, but many scientists now say it's unlikely countries will stay below that threshold.

But the world has made some progress. Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. And if countries agree to do what they've said so far, they could stave off a little over a full degree Celsius warming. That may not sound like much, but every tenth of a degree matters when it comes to the effects on catastrophic weather.

This year, countries had homework: to show up with their updated national plans to fight climate change. The United States, one of the world's biggest polluters, won't be submitting theirs, having dropped out of the Paris Agreement. And many experts have criticized other countries' plans as too little to do what's needed.

No landmark deal is expected. Does that mean this is no big deal?

Unlike the Paris Agreement, or even last year when negotiators were trying to get countries to agree on how much rich countries should pay poor countries to adapt to climate change, this year's talks aren't expected to end with any ambitious new deal.

Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year's conference as the “implementation COP.”

“Those who go to Belem asking the question ‘what is the agreement that is going to come out of it?' are asking the wrong question,” said Christiana Figueres, former U.N. climate chief.

For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

But Panama’s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told The Associated Press that he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become “a jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.”

Many Lansing residents are concerned that the data center will raise electricity costs, generate noise pollution and drain the region’s water resources.
Lansing resident Aaron Guilbeau, who lives on the banks of Cayuga Lake close to the proposed site for TeraWulf’s data center, is worried about hearing the low hum of the data center from his home, and that the value of his property would drop as a result.

But she lives six miles from the proposed data center, she said, and fears the data center will mean higher electricity rates.","Residents in an upstate New York community are trying to prevent construction of a planned data center by approving a year-long ban on large-scale development.

Data center company TeraWulf has signed an 80-year lease for 183 acres of a former coal-fired power plant, which sits on the banks of Cayuga Lake in Lansing, a town of 11,000 just north of Ithaca in New York’s Finger Lakes region.

Many Lansing residents are concerned that the data center will raise electricity costs, generate noise pollution and drain the region’s water resources.

The town board is scheduled to vote this month on a proposed moratorium that could derail TeraWulf’s plans.

According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, TeraWulf has the right to develop up to 400 megawatts of data center capacity there. In context, the center would be capable of sucking up around 16 percent of the total power capacity of the Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station, the state’s largest power producer and the second-largest plant of its kind in the country.

Lansing resident Aaron Guilbeau, who lives on the banks of Cayuga Lake close to the proposed site for TeraWulf’s data center, is worried about hearing the low hum of the data center from his home, and that the value of his property would drop as a result.

Like many in Lansing, Guilbeau believes that the center will affect his quality of life and utility bills. He is not alone. Hundreds of residents have submitted public comments, many of which raise possible issues with water use and noise. They have also flocked to public meetings about the moratorium to criticize TeraWulf and the data center industry.

Union members and some business leaders, however, support the data center, excited about the prospect of new construction and maintenance jobs the site could bring to the area.

“These are good jobs,” said David Emmi, the vice president of O’Connell Electric, an electrical contractor based out of upstate New York, at a town board meeting in September. “It really is a great thing for the community.”

But residents’ reservations are not unfounded. Data centers often need significant amounts of water to cool their computers—for some, that means hundreds of thousands of gallons.

In a letter to the town board, TeraWulf said that it will not rely on Cayuga Lake to cool its computers. In an email statement, a TeraWulf spokesperson said that the facility will use “a fully closed-loop cooling system” that circulates water and a food additive called propylene glycol to cool the data center computers. The heat from the data center is transferred to a secondary water loop, which is cooled by large fans.

During the site’s operations, the spokesperson wrote, “the system is sealed, it does not consume or discharge water.” The coolant can remain in the system for seven to fifteen years, according to the spokesperson, without requiring replacement or recharge.

At an event organized by TeraWulf to engage residents, Sean Farrell, the company’s chief operating officer, touted the system’s benefits. Farrell also told residents that to cool a 50-megawatt building, TeraWulf would use around 250,000 to 300,000 gallons on the first day of operations.

After that, water would only be needed for “periodic maintenance or negligible replenishment due to evaporation within the sealed system” a spokesperson said.

Many data centers cool their computers by running water through a system and then dump it back out at elevated temperatures, with some water lost due to evaporation. A dry cooling system like Terawulf’s, which uses air to keep temperatures low, requires much less water than other cooling systems, because it recycles water and very little evaporates, according to the European Climate Adaptation Platform.

But this type of cooling can require significant energy to keep the fans running, according to the Energy Information Administration which examined the use of these systems in power plants. The system may also struggle to reject heat during warm weather because the difference between the outside temperature and the computer heat is minor.

Data centers are also known to emit a near-constant low-frequency hum that neighbors often hear. Farrell said the company has chosen “ultra-low noise” coolers for the site that are designed to operate at a lower decibel level than traditional systems.

TeraWulf operates a cryptocurrency mining center facility in Somerset, New York, where residents have long complained about the noise. In response to these criticisms, Farrell said the company has “implemented noise reduction solutions” and has conducted tests showing that noise from the facility does not reach these residents’ property.

On its website, TeraWulf says it operates “state-of-the-art infrastructure that fuses advanced computing technologies with sustainable energy.” At his company’s event, Farrell discussed the “abundant zero-carbon power” in the region, suggesting that the data center will be powered primarily by renewable energy.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has said that upstate New York’s power mix is “approaching 90 percent emission‐free.” But there is no way to know where the power for TeraWulf’s proposed new data center would be coming from because it is connected to the state grid, not an individual power source, a spokesperson for the state’s grid operator said.

Kristin Maushart, who has lived in Lansing for 11 years, had never attended a town board meeting before. But she lives six miles from the proposed data center, she said, and fears the data center will mean higher electricity rates. So on Sept. 24, she made her way to a meeting.

“When I got there, the line was literally out the door,” she said. “I had to wait an hour, actually, to get into the room.”

Because data centers consume so much electricity, utilities may have to upgrade power lines or other grid infrastructure to supply more power to these sites. Even if the centers pay for connection to the grid, as they do in New York, there may also eventually be infrastructure upgrades needed in other areas of the state’s grid—and the cost of that is often passed on to ratepayers.

Additionally, rising demand for electricity can also cause an increase in prices. A recent blog post by the New York Independent System Operator, which operates New York’s grid, said that “electrification and data center growth drives up prices and prompts calls for accelerated investment in new resources.”

The operator also said that the state could face reliability issues as early as next year due, in part, to the additional demand from data centers.

One report from the state grid operator predicted that, by 2030, electricity demand could increase by an additional 1,600 megawatts to nearly 4,000 megawatts because of large power drains such as data centers and building electrification across the state.

The TeraWulf spokesperson said that the data center at Cayuga Lake will curtail power use during peak demand to help stabilize the grid.

Nov 7 (Reuters) – The Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday it approved 14 requests from small refineries for full or partial exemptions to the nation’s biofuel blending mandates, drawing criticism from a top U.S. biofuel trade group.

The decisions effectively clear the remainder of the agency’s huge backlog of such requests that had built up under former President Joe Biden’sadministration. The EPA had approved 140 petitions in part or in full earlier this year, and denied just 28, leaving just a handful from previous years remaining under review.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel pool each year. But small refiners can seek exemptions if they show the obligations would cause them significant financial hardship.

The waivers have been a lightning rod of contention between oil refiners who want to avoid costly blending obligations and biofuel advocates concerned that they eat into their market.

Under Friday’s decision, two applications were granted 100% exemptions, and 12 were granted 50% exemptions.

The Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuel industry trade group, criticized the waivers as harmful to farmers.

“Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,” RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper said.

The thresholds are notably lower than the previous pay package approved in 2021, which required share prices to hit $110–$295 per share.
Scaringe already owns around 2% of the company, while Musk controls about 13% of Tesla, a stake that could rise to 25% under his newly approved plan.
Analysts note that Rivian’s plan, though much smaller, draws clear inspiration from Tesla’s structure, linking extraordinary rewards to equally ambitious performance.
The new plan marks Rivian’s bid to reward long-term execution rather than short-term market performance.","Rivian’s board has approved a new compensation package for CEO RJ Scaringe worth as much as $4.6 billion over the next decade — a move that mirrors Tesla’s headline-grabbing $1 trillion pay plan for Elon Musk.

The decision underscores how Musk’s compensation structure has become a model for high-growth companies seeking to tie executive rewards to ambitious performance targets and shareholder value creation.

Rivian said the plan aims to retain its founder while keeping him focused on profitability and expansion as the company prepares to roll out its smaller, more affordable R2 SUV next year. The R2 is expected to compete directly with Tesla’s Model Y, one of the world’s best-selling electric crossovers.

The company’s decision comes amid broader financial pressure on electric vehicle makers. Rivian has struggled with slowing sales following the removal of key U.S. EV tax credits and has recently laid off about 600 workers — roughly 4.5% of its workforce — to reduce costs.

According to Reuters, the new incentive plan replaces a previous one that Rivian’s board said was unlikely to be met under current market conditions.

Under the revised plan, Scaringe will receive options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian’s Class A stock at an exercise price of $15.22 each — the same as Thursday’s closing price. The award will vest if the company meets stock price milestones ranging from $40 to $140 per share over 10 years, alongside new operating income and cash flow goals over seven years. The thresholds are notably lower than the previous pay package approved in 2021, which required share prices to hit $110–$295 per share. Rivian canceled that deal after concluding the targets were unrealistic.

At full vesting, the new package represents about 3% of Rivian’s shares. Scaringe already owns around 2% of the company, while Musk controls about 13% of Tesla, a stake that could rise to 25% under his newly approved plan.

“RJ’s starting position makes this package much more reasonable than Musk’s,” said Vitaly Golomb, managing partner at Mavka Capital and a Rivian investor.

Tesla’s board has argued that Musk’s massive $1 trillion package, approved last week after months of controversy, was essential to keep him focused on driving the company’s value toward an $8 trillion valuation. Analysts note that Rivian’s plan, though much smaller, draws clear inspiration from Tesla’s structure, linking extraordinary rewards to equally ambitious performance.

“While Rivian may not be a direct copycat, there are definitely Elon Musk characteristics that are similar,” said Yonat Assayag, a partner at ClearBridge Compensation Group. “It’s not to keep up with Musk, but inspired by Musk’s award.”

Rivian said shareholders will gain $153 billion in value if the company hits all the milestones as part of the package, while Reuters’ calculation showed that Scaringe will get up to $4.6 billion, including the costs of exercising options.

However, not everyone is convinced that such ambitious pay designs will pay off. Amit Batish, director at research firm Equilar, noted that “while these packages sound attractive, they don’t always work out. Many CEOs struggle to hit the targets due to changing policies and economic headwinds.”

In addition to the stock-based incentives, Rivian’s board has doubled Scaringe’s base salary to $2 million, aligning his compensation more closely with shareholder returns. The automaker said the revised structure was crafted with input from an independent consultant.

Rivian also announced that Scaringe will chair the board of Mind Robotics, a new spinoff backed by external investors to develop industrial AI systems. The CEO has been granted 1 million common units in the venture, representing up to a 10% stake once profitability thresholds are met.

The new plan marks Rivian’s bid to reward long-term execution rather than short-term market performance. But as the EV industry faces intensifying competition, high borrowing costs, and uncertain demand, analysts say it will test whether tying billion-dollar compensation to future milestones can truly motivate sustainable growth — or simply replicate the high-risk model that made Tesla’s rise so polarizing.",https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Amazon-Rivian.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:19:14.079022

The two-year tipping point where EVs beat gas cars

Researchers at Duke University decided to crunch the numbers properly.

They looked at how much pollution comes from making, fueling, and driving both gas and electric cars over time.

And while gas cars might look cleaner to start with, they fall behind fast.

Because after two years of driving, an EV’s total emissions drop below those of a gas car doing the same miles.

At first, electric cars start about 30 percent worse because of how their batteries are made.

But once you’re driving, they clean up their act quickly.

The team used a big global model (basically a super calculator for climate data) to check how things play out through to 2050, and the results are clear.

By 2030, every extra bit of battery power could stop nearly 500 pounds of carbon from entering the atmosphere.

And over a car’s full lifetime, the air-pollution damage from gas cars is up to three times worse.

The race toward cleaner miles

Now, this study didn’t count everything, like what happens when you scrap a car or build chargers, but it still shows where things are heading.

EVs are improving faster than anyone expected, and cleaner electricity means they’ll pay off even quicker.

Brands like Toyota and Volvo are already building next-gen batteries and charging perks to push that timeline down even further.

So, while gas cars puff away like it’s still 1999, the EVs are catching up.

And lapping them by year two.

Driving electric isn’t just trendy, it’s cleaner, cheaper, and officially ahead in the race to zero.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/gas-or-electric.webp,N,,2025-11-08 18:58:52.876116

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) presented its Q3 2025 earnings review on November 7, 2025, reporting adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.76. Despite the earnings beat, Duke Energy’s stock dipped 0.79% in pre-market trading to $123.02.

The company narrowed its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to $6.25-$6.35 and reaffirmed its long-term growth rate of 5-7% through 2029. Duke Energy’s presentation highlighted significant capital expansion plans and accelerating load growth driven by data centers and manufacturing customers.

Quarterly Performance Highlights

Duke Energy reported Q3 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.81, representing a 13% increase from $1.60 in the same period last year. Year-to-date adjusted EPS reached $4.81, up 15% from $4.17 in 2024. The company’s Electric Utilities & Infrastructure segment was the primary driver of growth, contributing an additional $0.24 per share compared to the prior year quarter.

The following slide details the Q3 2025 adjusted EPS performance and key drivers:

Weather had a modest negative impact of $0.02 per share during the quarter, with total weather effects for Q3 2025 amounting to $39 million pretax. Despite this headwind, rate cases, riders, and increased volumes supported the strong quarterly performance.

Strategic Capital Expansion

A centerpiece of Duke Energy’s presentation was its expanded capital investment plan. The company expects to announce a $95 billion capital plan for 2026-2030, with an additional $10 billion in potential upside opportunities. This represents a significant increase from the current $87 billion plan for 2025-2029 and is projected to drive earnings base growth from approximately 8% to 8.5%+.

The expanded capital plan focuses on customer value and affordability through various strategies, including fleet investments, AI utilization, and tax credit leveraging:

To meet growing demand, Duke Energy is advancing more than 8.5 GW of new dispatchable generation across its service territories. The company has secured critical agreements to support this build-out, including 19 gas turbines through a partnership agreement and EPC contracts for multiple combined cycle facilities:

Load Growth and Customer Acquisition

Duke Energy highlighted accelerating load growth as a key driver of its expansion plans. Enterprise-wide load growth is expected to increase from 1.5-2% in 2026 to 3-4% in 2027-2029, with even stronger growth projected in the Carolinas (4-5% in 2027-2029).

This growth is supported by approximately 3 GW of recently signed data center agreements and electric service agreements (ESAs) with major companies including Amazon, BMW Group, Digital Realty, and Novo Nordisk:

The company emphasized that its contract structures for large loads include provisions to protect existing customers, such as minimum billing demands, credit support requirements, interruptibility provisions, and termination damages.

Financial Strength and Investor Value

Duke Energy’s presentation outlined its balance sheet strength and positioning for growth. The company is on target to achieve 14%+ FFO/Debt by the end of 2025 and is targeting 15% FFO/Debt over the long term. It has also made progress on storm cost recovery, with approximately $1 billion of North Carolina bonds issued and $600 million of South Carolina bonds expected:

For investors, Duke Energy presented an attractive value proposition combining a 3.4% dividend yield with long-term dividend growth and an attractive risk-adjusted total shareholder return of approximately 10%:

Regulatory Updates and Recovery Mechanisms

The company provided details on its regulatory activities across multiple jurisdictions, including rate cases in the Carolinas, Kentucky, and other states. These regulatory proceedings are critical to supporting Duke Energy’s capital recovery and growth plans:

Duke Energy emphasized that the vast majority of its electric capital investments are eligible for modern recovery mechanisms, which helps mitigate regulatory lag. These mechanisms include multi-year rate plans, riders, forecasted test years, and formula rate contracts:

Forward-Looking Guidance

Duke Energy narrowed its 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.25-$6.35 and reaffirmed its long-term growth rate of 5-7% through 2029. The company expressed confidence in achieving results in the top half of this range beginning in 2028, based on the midpoint of the 2025 guidance ($6.30).

Key drivers for 2026 earnings include North Carolina and Florida multi-year rate plans, Indiana rate case outcomes, South Carolina rate cases, and continued customer growth and economic development. The company also highlighted structural tailwinds from population migration and economic development as supporting long-term earnings growth.

In the Carolinas, Duke Energy filed its integrated resource plan in October 2025, emphasizing reliability and affordability while supporting an ""all of the above"" resource mix including natural gas, battery storage, and solar. The plan maintains optionality for new nuclear to be online by 2037 and projects a customer bill impact CAGR of 2.1% over the next decade.

Conclusion

Duke Energy’s Q3 2025 presentation showcased strong financial performance with adjusted EPS of $1.81, up 13% year-over-year. The company’s strategic focus on expanding its capital investment plan to $95-105 billion for 2026-2030 positions it to capitalize on accelerating load growth from data centers and manufacturing customers.

While the stock experienced a slight pre-market decline despite the earnings beat, Duke Energy’s long-term outlook remains positive, supported by constructive regulatory environments, modern recovery mechanisms, and structural growth drivers in its service territories. The company’s balanced approach to reliability, affordability, and shareholder returns provides a foundation for its projected 5-7% long-term EPS growth through 2029.

,EVs,2025-11-08 20:05:15+00:00,Meer,COP30: keeping the faith - Meer,"William Becker, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.meer.com/en/99902-cop30-keeping-the-faith,"Last June, the world’s nearly 200 nations gathered in Bonn to discuss their efforts to minimize global climate change.
For the first time in 30 years, the United States was not in the room.
That’s not to say the United States is not involved.
Yet, while the United States complicates the world’s ability to stabilize the climate, it is not the only problem.
The United States will be back.","Last June, the world’s nearly 200 nations gathered in Bonn to discuss their efforts to minimize global climate change. For the first time in 30 years, the United States was not in the room. The U.S. is expected to be absent again in two days, when the rest of the world resumes those discussions at COP30.

It will not participate because America is no longer a party to the Paris Climate Agreement, thanks to President Donald Trump.

That’s not to say the United States is not involved. Although government science programs have been shuttered and Trump has banned the use of the word “climate,” American scientists are still working on solutions. However, America remains the world’s second-largest source of carbon pollution, and it is led by a president determined to make the U.S. an outlier, an outlaw, and a free rider in the global climate movement.

The question is whether other countries will let President Trump get away with it.

America’s official position – Trump’s policies to increase fossil-fuel production, suppress clean energy technologies, and abandon carbon-cutting goals – is at least as harmful domestically as it is internationally. President Trump is actively shutting down clean energy investments, including a wind-energy project that had already broken ground.

The Trump administration’s opposition to a wind energy project off the coast of Maryland has put its sponsor, US Wind, at risk of bankruptcy. Sponsors of a wind farm off the Massachusetts coast say they will not proceed because Trump’s policies have left them with “no viable path.”

In September alone, clean energy manufacturers cancelled construction of four new plants totaling $1.6 billion in investments. General Motors has stopped production of an electric van because Trump prevailed on the U.S. Congress to eliminate EV tax credits.

Although solar and wind power are cheaper than electricity generated by fossil fuels, Trump’s policies leave the U.S. electric system dangerously dependent on the economic volatility and pollution of natural gas and coal. Natural gas is widely touted as a “transition fuel,” but its price in the United States has gone up to the point that electric utilities are turning back to coal.

Last year, before Trump took office, clean energy jobs grew three times faster than the rest of America’s workforce, providing economic momentum. Now, companies have canceled more than $22 billion in clean energy manufacturing capacity, leading to significant job losses and missed opportunities for U.S. economic growth. One estimate is that a federal budget Trump pushed through Congress in July could cost the United States more than 830,000 jobs in the next five years, signifying a major economic setback.

Trump’s carbon-intensive energy policies may put U.S. businesses at a disadvantage in international markets. The EU plans to tax carbon-intensive imports starting next year; the UK plans the same in 2027. Other nations could follow. Companies that continue exporting carbon-intensive products will lose market share, and their American employees will lose jobs.

Nevertheless, Trump continues branding climate change as a hoax and a scam.

Why do his policies make America an international outlaw? A new study by the University of Washington estimates that Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris pact will raise the planet’s temperature by an additional 0.1 percent, assuming all other countries meet their goals. That doesn’t sound like much, but it means the chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees, the upper limit set in Paris, will decrease from 34 percent to 27 percent. The study’s lead author, Prof. Adrian Raftery, says this is the most optimistic calculation of Trump’s impact.

Trump has used the threat of trade tariffs to extort the European Union and other nations into buying U.S. oil and gas, despite their own commitments under the Paris Agreement. The administration, joined by Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, just blocked a proposed global tax on carbon pollution from shipping, a policy developed over 10 years.

In short, Trump has turned America from a global leader on mitigating climate change to a “go-it-alone pariah.”

However, the United States remains a signatory to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that signatory nations are obligated to cooperate in combating climate change. Even if the United States tried to withdraw from the UNFCCC, the ICJ cited other international treaties that require countries to “fulfill their duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence,” especially in situations such as global warming, where the climate system is a “resource shared by all states.”

In the ICJ’s opinion, countries failing to meet their environmental obligations are liable for paying damages and reparations. Although no country has sued the United States yet, Trump’s reckless and renegade energy policies may make it only a matter of time.

Yet, while the United States complicates the world’s ability to stabilize the climate, it is not the only problem. Efforts to hold global warming to well below 2°C are lacking in many other nations, as is progress on most of the world’s other 3,000 multilateral environmental agreements, including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

In addition, scientists convened by the Stockholm Resilience Institute, who defined nine critical planetary boundaries in 2009, say we have now crossed into dangerous territory for seven. Analysts say the barriers to international collaboration on environmental agreements include a lack of political will, limited resources, weak enforcement mechanisms, fragmented governance, and disagreements over who is responsible for ecological damages and threats. However, these problems are not unsolvable.

Trump’s international bullying raises the question of what else he may be doing to subvert the world’s timely transition to clean energy. It is worrying that three other countries joined the U.S. to stall the tax on carbon pollution from shipping. All countries must hold fast to the Paris Agreement. The United States will be back.

As for COP30, the best outcome would be for the remaining 195 countries in the Paris pact to demonstrate how nations can navigate the barriers to fulfill the visions of two of our great departed naturalists.

With over 290 licensed enterprises already operating, these zones now face a defining moment as global supply chains demand greener industrial credentials before committing capital.

Two major solar projects signal this shift: the 200 megawatt peak (MWp) solar development at the Dawa Industrial Zone by Solar For Industries Limited, and the 16.82MWp rooftop solar installation within the Tema Export Processing Zone by Helios Solar Energy. President John Dramani Mahama broke ground for the Dawa solar park on November 6, naming it the Norbert Anku Solar Park. The facility will eventually expand to 1,000MWp by 2032.

The Tema project, commissioned in July 2024, became Africa’s largest single rooftop solar installation, covering 95,754 square metres atop the International Warehousing Company Mega Warehouse. The International Finance Corporation provided $30 million in financing for clean power and water infrastructure, expecting the solar plant to cut Ghana’s emissions by approximately 13,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year.

Renewable energy has moved beyond being an optional feature for industrial parks. It’s now a prerequisite for competitiveness, particularly as manufacturing firms face mounting pressure to reduce carbon footprints and comply with international trade standards. Power reliability challenges in sub-Saharan Africa force businesses to shoulder significant costs, with energy expenses eating into operating margins and deterring foreign investment.

The next generation of Special Economic Zones will need sustainability and innovation baked into their core design. This matches the global pattern where investors increasingly require proof of environmental performance before committing funds. The commercial logic proves compelling: companies operating in renewable-powered zones can slash operating costs, meet international carbon standards, and tap into climate finance instruments that weren’t available to conventional industrial parks.

Ghana’s Free Zones and future SEZs could become testing grounds for green bond backed industrial finance, offering companies reduced borrowing costs when they adopt clean energy and resource efficiency upgrades. This creates opportunities not just for large foreign firms but also for local suppliers who can integrate into these greener value chains.

The government’s role centers on bridging the financing gap through targeted tax incentives, blended finance partnerships, and transparent sustainability metrics. Investors commit capital when they see that green SEZs deliver profits, not just compliance. High capital costs for renewable infrastructure and limited concessional financing remain obstacles that require coordinated policy responses.

The Dawa solar project will supply power to the Enclave Power Company network serving industrial clients rather than Ghana’s national grid. Industries within the Dawa Industrial Enclave will receive a 10 percent discount on power sourced from the solar park, according to Kojo Aduhene, Chief Executive Officer of Quarm Investments.

President Mahama emphasized that solar powered industrial parks help protect Ghanaian jobs, maintain market access, and position the country’s industries to compete under the African Continental Free Trade Area and other trade agreements. He noted that Ghana’s industries must stay competitive under new global regulations, including the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which will penalize exports from countries with high carbon footprints.

For local businesses, the opportunity lies in becoming suppliers to global firms operating within these zones. This represents a critical pathway toward inclusive growth, allowing Ghanaian enterprises to participate in international value chains while meeting stringent environmental standards.

The global race for sustainable manufacturing has begun. Countries that successfully integrate clean energy into their industrial zones will attract investment flows that bypass traditional fossil fuel dependent locations. Ghana possesses the natural resources, policy frameworks, and geographic advantages to capture a meaningful share of these green value chains.

Under Ghana’s National Renewable Energy Master Plan, the government has set a target to achieve at least 15 percent renewable energy share by 2030. Solar projects like those at Dawa and Tema advance this goal while aligning Ghana with the global clean energy transition.

The potential remains significant, but realizing it demands bold and coordinated policy action. Ghana’s Free Zones and SEZs could deliver more than export revenues. They could fundamentally redefine the country’s growth model, making it cleaner, more competitive, and more sustainable. Success requires moving beyond incremental changes toward integrated strategies that treat renewable energy, water management, and industrial development as interconnected priorities rather than separate initiatives.

If executed effectively, Ghana’s approach to green industrial zones could serve as a model for other African nations seeking to balance economic development with environmental sustainability. The window for action is narrowing as global investors increasingly allocate capital based on climate performance and long term sustainability rather than short term cost advantages alone.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-11-08 15:19:26.531596

Mark Carney’s first budget as Finance Minister quietly provided Canada with the ingredients for something the country has lacked for a century: a truly national electricity backbone. The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a 15% refundable credit on new generation, storage, and the transmission of electricity between provinces and territories, looks like a simple fiscal tool. It is not. It is the seed of a connected, modern grid that could knit together the regional islands of Canadian electricity into a single low-carbon engine for the electrified economy ahead. And it’s far from the only lever that can be pulled to drive Canada’s second Golden Spike, this one delivering clean electrons sea-to-sea, not freight and passengers on gleaming rails.

Canada’s electricity system was built for another era. The provinces each developed their own grids to serve their local industries and populations, often connecting south to American markets but rarely to one another. Québec built high-voltage DC lines to New England. Manitoba strung its Bipoles to the U.S. Midwest. Alberta and British Columbia tied into the Western Interconnection, while the Maritimes remained isolated on small synchronous systems. The result is a federation of grids with minimal east-west connection. Canada’s three asynchronous regions—Western, Eastern, and Québec—still cannot freely share significant terawatt-hours of energy.

That separation matters more every year. Electrification is expanding into everything from transport and heat to new industrial processes. Data centers, electrified steel mills and electrified ports demand new capacity. Decarbonization targets and climate resilience call for moving vast amounts of clean power across the country. Yet the most wind and hydro potential sits far from the greatest demand.

Hydropower gives Canada a built-in advantage that few nations possess. Reservoir systems across Québec, Manitoba, and British Columbia act as vast passive batteries, capable of ramping output up or down in seconds to balance intermittent generation. Linking those provinces through HVDC corridors would allow the country to use that flexibility at a continental scale. Solar output peaks later in the West, where Alberta and Saskatchewan can overgenerate in the afternoon and push surplus electrons eastward as Ontario and Québec approach evening demand. Wind follows its own rhythm: prairie winds often rise when Atlantic and Pacific systems calm, and offshore gusts in Newfoundland and Labrador frequently complement interior lulls. With interprovincial transmission spanning multiple time zones, Canada could level production and demand across thousands of kilometers, turning variability into stability and making clean electricity as dispatchable as the fossil power it replaces.

The 2025 budget reframed the federal role in fixing that problem. It made transmission projects eligible for the clean electricity credit and removed restrictions that previously kept provincial Crown corporations—the real builders of Canadian power lines—from using it. It also aligned the Canada Infrastructure Bank and the Canada Growth Fund as partners, making it easier to combine low-cost federal financing with utility capital and Indigenous equity. The message was clear: the federal government will help carry the risk of nation-scale grid investments.

On paper, Canada already has the beginnings of a cross-country network. The new Wasoqonatl Reliability Intertie between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick will add a 345 kV AC double-circuit line spanning roughly 160 kilometres, supported by $217 million in Infrastructure Bank equity and slated for construction later this decade. British Columbia and Alberta have a legislated plan to restore nearly one gigawatt of transfer capacity on their 500 kV AC intertie by 2026, reversing years of constraint caused by aging equipment and operational limits. Alberta and Saskatchewan are replacing and uprating shared 230 kV AC transmission assets to improve cross-border flows and strengthen reliability across the Prairie seam. Ontario and Québec are examining expansion of their 315 kV and 500 kV AC interties, with options for ±320 kV HVDC back-to-back converters to manage asynchronous operation and trade. Manitoba, meanwhile, is assessing replacement of end-of-life 500 kV transformers and control systems at its eastern boundary, where integration with Ontario could eventually involve new ±500 kV HVDC converters. None of these are megaprojects yet, but together they are the structural anchors of a future national HVDC backbone.

The real opportunity is to connect these regional projects into an east-west HVDC overlay that carries controllable, low-loss power flows between regions. Modern voltage-source HVDC technology can operate as multi-terminal systems rather than simple point-to-point lines. That means each provincial node can be built as a discrete project and later interconnected into a national mesh. The technical foundations already exist. Labrador’s Muskrat Falls line and the Maritime Link are both HVDC systems. Manitoba’s Bipole III, at 500 kV, is one of the longest HVDC lines in the world. Québec’s export grid to the U.S. is built on similar technology. Extending this expertise to interprovincial corridors is not a leap of imagination but an engineering progression.

In a phased plan, the Atlantic HVDC assets would connect through New Brunswick into Québec. The central corridor would link Manitoba and Ontario through upgraded interties and new converter stations. The western seam between Alberta and Saskatchewan would become the HVDC bridge between the Western and Eastern Interconnections. Each region would continue to operate its own AC system, while the HVDC overlay would transfer surplus generation and stabilize supply during peaks or outages. By 2035, the regional patches could be joined into a multi-terminal DC grid capable of balancing renewable generation across the country in real time.

The proposed North Atlantic Transmission One–Link, or NATO-L, is an ambitious trans-Atlantic HVDC project that would connect Eastern Canada with Ireland or the United Kingdom through roughly 6 GW of subsea transmission capacity. My involvement has been peripheral, focused on early-stage assessment of hydroelectric balancing potential between the continents and on reviewing initial collateral from the project’s technical and financial teams. NATO-L represents a strong enhancement of the value proposition for both sides of the Atlantic. With a cross-Canada HVDC spine in place, the country’s hydro, wind, and solar assets could feed into a unified grid capable of supporting Europe during periods of low renewable output, while importing power when domestic conditions tighten. Canada and Europe, long-standing allies in security and trade, could extend that partnership into the energy domain, sharing clean electrons across the ocean as readily as they now share commitments to stability and decarbonization.

The economics are compelling. Transmission accounts for a modest fraction of total system costs but delivers reliability and curtailment savings that compound over decades. Studies of interprovincial grid expansion show potential net benefits in the tens of billions by 2050 from avoided fossil generation and improved utilization of hydro and wind. The tax credit reduces the weighted average cost of capital by cutting effective project costs up to 15%, improving the internal rate of return for provincial utilities and Indigenous partners. With the Infrastructure Bank and Growth Fund offering low-interest capital and equity participation, the public risk is contained while long-term national benefits are captured.

What remains is coordination. Canada has no national transmission authority. Planning, permitting, and cost allocation sit within provincial jurisdiction, and environmental reviews can stretch for years. Building an HVDC overlay requires a formal framework similar to Australia’s integrated system plan or the U.S. Department of Energy’s designated transmission corridors. A National Transmission Accord, endorsed by provinces, utilities, and Indigenous governments, could establish shared standards for HVDC design, set interconnection rules, and coordinate permitting. It would not federalize electricity but harmonize it.

In May of 2024, 28 energy ministers in Europe agreed that it was essential to build a European transmission system, not a country-by-country system, and this year started the process of creating a European transmission planning organization. I had a small part in that, having edited the second edition of Supergrid Super Solution, Eddie O’Connor and Kevin O’Sullivan’s handbook for a European HVDC mesh supergrid, a book that’s on every European energy ministers’ desk, sharing a stage in Brussels in October at its launch with one of the energy ministers and a member of European parliament, among others, to discuss it, and helping strategize and launch Supergrid Europe, a new Brussels-based NGO devoted to advocating for the supergrid. Europe, while it’s moving too slowly, is moving. Canada needs to recognize that this is the direction of the world and move rapidly to keep up.

My Sankey energy flows vision of an electrified Canadian economy shows the payoff. Fossil fuels feeding into transportation, heating, and industry shrink to zero, while electricity, ambient heat and biomass flows expand to replace them. Hydro, wind and solar dominate the primary energy input, converging into a continental-scale grid that distributes power efficiently from coast to coast. On the right side of the diagram, energy services—mobility, heating, and industrial production—consume electricity directly. Rejected energy, the losses inherent in combustion, nearly disappears, dropping from two-thirds of all primary energy in today’s economy to a fifth in a decarbonized future.

This vision of an electrified and efficient electrostate isn’t a fantasy. China is building it incredibly rapidly today, shooting past the west in the electrification of industry and transportation and the deployment of renewables, with massive transmission corridors linking hydro, wind and solar megascale complexes in the west and northwest to demand centers in the south east. Sub-Saharan Africa is leapfrogging the west, with solar deployments shooting up in the last year, and studies for 10,000 km HVDC interconnectors linking a dozen countries the breadth and length of the continent. Pakistan deployed 17 GW of solar, cheap Chinese panels on rooftops without subsidies, often with cheap Chinese batteries buffering them, in 2024 alone, has reconductored 80% of its existing transmission lines, and has built massive north-south HVDC interconnections with China’s help. India is hammering in wind and solar and built out its HVDC transmission in advance of solar deployments to avoid curtailment.

The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit isn’t the only budget element that can support this. Carney’s budget contains several other levers that can help Canada finance and coordinate a national HVDC backbone without inventing new institutions or programs. The most direct is the expansion of the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s statutory capital from $35 billion to $45 billion, paired with a broader mandate to invest in nation-building projects of any asset class. That opens the door for the Bank to take on equity or blended-financing roles in transmission corridors that cross provincial lines. The Bank already has a track record with the Wasoqonatl Reliability Intertie and other clean power projects. Giving it both capital and flexibility allows it to anchor the kind of multi-jurisdictional partnerships that HVDC lines require, combining federal patient capital with provincial and Indigenous investment.

The Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit adds another piece to the puzzle. It provides a 30% refundable credit on the cost of manufacturing equipment used to produce key clean-energy components, from batteries and solar panels to electrical transformers, converters, and high-voltage cables. For a national HVDC program, this credit can underwrite the industrial base that builds the physical backbone. Every converter station and transmission corridor depends on specialized, capital-intensive manufacturing of switchgear, rectifiers, and advanced power electronics. Locating that production inside Canada not only captures economic value but also shields the grid build from supply-chain volatility and import delays. If provinces or private manufacturers align their investments with this credit, Canada could anchor its own HVDC equipment production and feed a decades-long cycle of domestic infrastructure demand.

Canada already builds much of the equipment a national HVDC system would need. Hitachi Energy’s Varennes plant in Québec manufactures large HVDC transformers and converter components, supported by a new federal investment to expand production and simulation facilities. Domestic firms such as Northern Transformer in Ontario and PTI Transformers in Saskatchewan already produce high-voltage transformers for utilities across North America. This existing industrial and technical base gives Canada a running start toward scaling up the specialized manufacturing an HVDC backbone requires. The Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit wouldn’t be starting from a clean slate, but expanding on expertise and manufacturing we already have. It’s worth pointing out that Canada’s transformers and the steel and aluminum that are used to manufacture them are hit by Trump’s tariffs, so expanding our domestic market as well as seeking other markets is rational economic policy.

A new Major Projects Office is also being funded with over $200 million across five years to coordinate approvals, financing, and Indigenous participation for nationally significant infrastructure. Transmission lines suffer more from procedural drag than from lack of money. Each province has its own regulatory and consultation regime, and interprovincial lines often need federal environmental assessments as well. An office that can unify reviews, coordinate Indigenous engagement, and streamline permitting is more valuable to an HVDC build than another tranche of cash. Without institutional coordination, no amount of funding will move electrons across provincial borders.

The Build Communities Strong Fund, worth about $51 billion over ten years, offers another entry point. Most of its streams target local and community infrastructure, but its “direct delivery” arm explicitly supports regionally significant projects. HVDC lines do not exist in isolation—they need access roads, right-of-way preparation, and community resilience infrastructure along their routes. Using portions of this fund to develop corridor access or regional substations would reduce front-end costs and help rural and northern communities benefit from construction.

The budget’s new Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund also fits indirectly into the picture. With $2 billion over five years earmarked for domestic supply chains, it can strengthen the industrial base needed for HVDC hardware. Voltage-source converters, high-voltage cables, and advanced transformers all depend on specialized metals and manufacturing. Canada has the minerals but little downstream processing. Strengthening that supply chain reduces import dependence and cost volatility for large-scale transmission builds.

Then there is the broader infrastructure envelope—$280 billion over five years. It is framed around protecting communities, building competitiveness, and modernizing assets. That language captures transmission as easily as it does bridges or transit. As provinces look to tap those funds, HVDC projects should be positioned as resilience investments: infrastructure that keeps industries operating, cities powered, and renewable energy moving during extreme weather.

Finally, the budget builds out Indigenous participation funding, from consultation support to equity financing structures. Every cross-country transmission project will intersect Indigenous territories, and inclusion is non-negotiable. These programs can underwrite equity stakes and build capacity so that Indigenous nations are partners, not stakeholders. The combination of Indigenous equity mechanisms and Infrastructure Bank participation could define the financial model of a twenty-first-century national grid—shared investment, shared governance, and shared benefit.

One of the most important details in the 2025 budget is the removal of restrictions that previously prevented provincial and territorial Crown corporations from accessing federal clean electricity tax credits. Those utilities own and operate most of Canada’s generation and transmission assets, yet they were originally excluded from the incentive structure designed to decarbonize them. By lifting that barrier, the federal government made the 15% Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit and related programs truly usable by the entities capable of delivering large projects. This change turns what was once a symbolic measure into a practical financing tool, allowing provincially owned utilities like Hydro-Québec, Manitoba Hydro, BC Hydro, SaskPower, and NB Power to apply the credits directly to capital costs for HVDC interties and other major grid upgrades.

Together, these mechanisms create the financial and institutional scaffolding for a cross-Canada HVDC system. They are not labeled as such, but they are ready to be connected. The Infrastructure Bank supplies capital, the Major Projects Office manages coordination, the community and critical-mineral funds handle the enablers, and Indigenous participation funding provides social license. The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit lowers the cost of capital for every eligible segment. The architecture of a national grid is already in the budget—it just needs to be built.

This transformation will not happen by decree, although strong federal leadership is necessary. It will take a decade or two of steady investment, technical cooperation, and Indigenous partnership. But the pieces are now visible. The tax credit lowers capital barriers. The Infrastructure Bank and Growth Fund provide patient capital. The provinces have active transmission projects that can double as HVDC corridors. The technologies are proven and Canadian utilities already run them.

The prize is a connected Canada where clean power moves freely across provinces, where hydropower balances wind, and where industries can electrify without fear of constraint. In a future where competitiveness is measured in clean terawatt-hours, the cross-Canada HVDC system is not a luxury project. It is the backbone of a modern electrified economy, waiting to be built.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-8-2025-08_18_43-AM-800x445.png,N,,2025-11-08 19:58:46.704353

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front—especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules—cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again—leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation Whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect. That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations—but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s Policies Are Costing Drivers More

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse-gas emission regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.","https://media.wired.com/photos/690c98a327a9fa6b4e201c19/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/e32fe4e60967b2faa0cc8d32427b3271af63fc94.jpeg",N,,2025-11-08 15:04:00.945807

They believe that Brazil will continue to use coal despite having over 80% of its electricity from renewable sources. As Brazil prepares to host the UN climate summit COP30, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed concern that the war in Ukraine has revived coal mining.

Experts like Christine Shearer from Global Energy Monitor argue that Brazil has the resources to phase out coal, but the strong coal lobby in mining regions keeps these plants running.

The Candiota plant lost its government contract last year, leading to local economic downturns and outmigration. It now sells energy on the spot market during peak hours when solar and wind energy are less available. Nevertheless, Brazil’s Congress recently passed a bill allowing coal plants to operate until 2040, which Lula could potentially veto. The government also made coal eligible for a capacity auction aimed at improving energy security by using thermal plants during low renewable output.

Critics note that including coal in these plans contradicts the goal of energy flexibility, as coal plants cannot start quickly. They argue that poor long-term planning allows coal to persist, despite a surplus of clean energy that goes underutilized due to inadequate demand and transmission infrastructure. This situation makes the government susceptible to coal and natural gas lobbying, leading to higher financial and environmental costs.

Ambar asserts that coal from the Candiota plant is reliable and necessary for power supply, denying claims of relying on political influence. They also argue that critics prioritize the interests of large energy consumers over those of smaller entities and the broader public. Keeping coal operational aligns Brazil with countries like India and South Africa, where strong lobby groups impede efforts to transition away from coal, which is crucial to local economies.

Shutting down Candiota could result in around 10,000 job losses in the region. Local coal miner Jose Adolfo de Carvalho asserts that eliminating the plant won’t significantly impact global carbon issues. The future of the plant causes anxiety among residents, with former employee Graca dos Santos emphasizing the need for a just energy transition to avoid leaving the community jobless.

Lula’s administration lacks a transition plan for Candiota, and little progress has been made in strategizing for other coal facilities. Some suggest diversifying into sectors like beef, wine, and olive oil, which could provide new jobs for former coal workers. Local union leader Hermelindo Ferreira highlights the potential job losses from shutting down Candiota while recognizing that faith in the coal industry is wavering. Ferreira encourages workers to gain new skills, such as maintenance for wind energy, as a way to adapt to future opportunities.

Through proposed regulations, the Treasury Department has offered tax relief to private equity firms, crypto companies, foreign real estate investors, and other large corporations, the New York Times first reported.

For example, in October, the IRS issued new proposed regulations that would provide breaks to foreign investors in U.S. real estate. In August, the IRS proposed a rollback of rules to prevent multinational corporations from dodging taxes by claiming duplicate losses in multiple countries.

The notices have not made headlines, but have been flagged by accounting and consulting firms.

“Treasury has clearly been enacting unlegislated tax cuts,” Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the think-tank American Enterprise Institute, told the Times. “Congress determines tax law. Treasury undermines this constitutional principle when it asserts more authority over the structure of the tax code than Congress provides it.”

The recent IRS tax notices tack on to the tax relief laid out in President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, which included the extension of the so-called “Trump tax cuts” from 2017 that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would reduce tax revenue by $4 trillion in the next decade.

The Independent has contacted the Treasury Department for comment.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” provides more than $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the top 5 percent of Americans, the Center for American Progress found.

The proposals target former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which ensured profitable corporations paid a minimum tax to combat inflation and reduce the federal deficit. That law generally required corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to pay 15 percent of the adjusted financial statement income.

A 2022 study suggested that only about 80 corporations would be subjected to this requirement. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the act would bring in $200 billion in revenue over the course of a decade.

In September, the IRS released notices regarding the 2002 minimum tax, issuing interim guidance that allows corporations to “disregard gains and losses that are unrealized for regular tax purposes” on its holdings of digital assets when calculating its adjusted financial statement income.

Strategy Inc, a crypto firm, announced it “no longer expects to become subject to” the minimum tax in light of the interim guidance, the company said in a SEC filing. Also citing the September guidance, natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy announced last month it was entitled to a refund of the previously paid minimum tax; the refund is worth $380 million, the Times reported.

A Treasury Department spokesperson told the Times the proposed regulations were “a practical approach that supports American investment and competitiveness” and were meant to replace the Biden administration’s “compliance maze that would have buried taxpayers in red tape.”

However, some experts have expressed concerns that the Treasury’s proposals could be contributing billions to the federal deficit — and could be exceeding its authority, as Congress is responsible for enacting federal tax laws.

Proposing regulations through the Treasury rather than passing laws through Congress means “you can just give away the goodies to one group, without having to take back anything from another,” Daniel Hemel, a law professor at New York University, told the paper. It’s a route that “that previous administrations have exploited and which the Trump administration is exploiting more aggressively,” Hemel said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3acc3e52ca135ec785677e7960006c1c,N,,2025-11-08 19:58:51.157836

The EU is contemplating its industrial decarbonization options as it aims to reach its 2030 clean energy goals. For far too long, the nuclear sector has largely been overlooked and at times completely ignored as a safe method to efficiently produce energy while not harming the environment, no more, says the EU.

The European Union is rolling out its first auction for industrial heat decarbonization

The heads of the EU Commission recently launched the very first pilot auction to decarbonize industrial heat. However, the new pilot auction does not include the nuclear sector, which has not stopped operators from commissioning atomic projects across the continent.

Europe has set itself some lofty and ambitious goals to decarbonize its energy sector by the end of the decade; however, the exclusion of the nuclear sector in its new auction round has raised fears over the continent’s ability to meet its self-imposed targets for decarbonization.

Process heat remains a major hindrance in the world’s decarbonization dreams

Processed heat from the industrial sector is among the speed bumps on the path towards a full-scale decarbonization of the energy sector, and several industry insiders have lamented the EU’s failure to prioritize the process heat issue as a main driver of the emissions problems that the world has been subjected to.

In October of this year, the EU launched the new and controversial initiative that aims to accelerate the decarbonization of the process heat created by energy operators on the continent. It should be noted that the nuclear sector has been excluded from the decarbonization initiative enacted by the EU Commission.

Despite the proclivity that Europe has for the unconventional, nuclear power on the continent is gaining momentum

Several industry experts have stated that process heat is the last piece of the puzzle that Europe and the world need to deal with in order to meet their decarbonization goals. The International Energy Agency, among the myriad of other energy sector watchdogs, has repeatedly flagged process heat as a major hindrance for the world in decarbonizing the energy sector.

Process heat accounts for a substantial amount of the energy sector’s emissions, and has been overlooked as the last hurdle that the world needs to jump over to meet its emission goals set out during the Paris Agreement in 2016.

Some European nations have not forgotten about the oldest of the renewable energy sources

Crucially, nuclear can alleviate the pressure to decarbonize, which is something that the EU seems to have forgotten. The cornerstone of the renewable energy sector has seen a substantial increase in commissioning as the world contemplates the best way to decarbonize process heat in the industrial sector.

Slovakia recently announced that it is evaluating US nuclear technology for a planned project that could transform the nation’s energy landscape.

Continuing to rely on fossil fuels no longer brings prosperity — it brings destruction.
Clean energy industries are creating millions of new jobs, stimulating innovation and strengthening energy independence.
They must commit to a clear, coordinated plan to phase out fossil fuels within the next 20 years, with measurable milestones and accountability.
The path away from fossil fuels is not one of sacrifice, but of renewal — of cleaner air, healthier people, more secure societies, and flourishing economies.","As the world prepares to gather in Belém, Brazil, for COP30, we appeal to all heads of state and government representatives attending: let this be the moment when the world finally unites around a plan to transition away from fossil fuels within the next two decades. The responsible approach, the only moral and economic choice, is to start that transition immediately. COP30 must be the place where the world’s nations agree on concrete, collective steps to phase out the burning of coal, oil, and gas and build the clean energy future that is already within reach.

The science is unambiguous, and the consequences are visible everywhere: devastating floods, heatwaves, fires and droughts are erasing decades of progress in development and social justice. The planetary emergency is not a distant threat — it is a direct attack on the world’s hard-won goals of eradicating poverty, ending hunger, protecting the environment and ensuring peace and stability. Every tonne of carbon emitted deepens inequality and undermines the foundations of human progress. No nation, no matter how wealthy or isolated, is immune.

Development and fossil fuels were once intertwined, but today that link is broken. Continuing to rely on fossil fuels no longer brings prosperity — it brings destruction. It erodes food security, drives migration, increases health costs and inflames conflicts. Around the world, communities that have contributed least to the problem are suffering the most from its effects. That is neither just nor sustainable. The only way to secure a stable and peaceful century is to phase out the burning of fossil fuels and replace them with clean, renewable and equitable sources of energy.

We also recognise the real challenges of getting there, particularly in developing nations where energy demand continues to rise and fossil fuels still underpin many economies. Leaders of nations across Latin America, Asia and Africa face intense pressures over oil expansion. This makes global solidarity and strong support essential for a just and achievable transition.

This transition is not a burden — it is an opportunity of historic proportions. The cost of renewable energy has plummeted over the past decade. Solar and wind power are now the cheapest sources of new electricity in most countries. Clean technologies like electric mobility, energy storage, green hydrogen and smart grids are advancing faster than anyone predicted. Across Africa, Asia, Latin America and beyond, distributed solar systems and mini-grids are bringing electricity to people who never had it before — quickly, affordably and without pollution. In cities and rural areas alike, these technologies are creating jobs, improving health, and giving communities control over their own energy futures.

Business leaders already understand this. Investments in renewable energy, green infrastructure and sustainable industries are not just ethical choices; they are the most rational economic ones. Clean energy industries are creating millions of new jobs, stimulating innovation and strengthening energy independence. Renewables are also inherently more secure for nations that currently rely on imported fossil fuels, reducing vulnerability to price shocks and geopolitical disruption. By contrast, fossil fuels expose countries to volatile prices, geopolitical instability, and stranded assets. The clean transition is, in every sense, the pathway to economic resilience and prosperity.

Addressing these challenges demands a major lift in climate and transition finance. Without it, the world’s most vulnerable nations cannot move at the speed required. We also recognize that this transition must be fair and inclusive. Workers, communities and developing nations that currently depend on fossil fuel economies deserve support and partnership to diversify and thrive. This requires international cooperation, not competition — coordination, not isolation. The task before us is vast, but the cost of inaction is immeasurably greater.

This is why COP30 is so crucial. Three decades after the Rio Earth Summit first placed sustainable development at the center of global diplomacy, and 10 years after the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world returns to Brazil facing an existential challenge. Belém offers a symbolic and practical opportunity to realign global ambition with planetary reality. Leaders must arrive ready to go beyond words and targets. They must commit to a clear, coordinated plan to phase out fossil fuels within the next 20 years, with measurable milestones and accountability.

The tools are in our hands. The economics are on our side. The moral case is undeniable. What is needed now is courage and unity. The world has shown before that when faced with a global challenge, we can act together — to end wars, cure diseases, and rebuild after crises. This is one of those moments.

As you and representatives from your governments gather in Brazil, you have a chance to show future generations that you rose to meet the defining test of our time.

But in the long term the biggest task for the European Union is to really think about how to allocate European battery production in Europe.
I'm talking about really building up European battery manufacturing.","European car manufacturing is facing a pincer maneuver of threats. From the East, China’s automotive industry is stretching its wings across the global market. To the West, the lucrative American economy has become both unpredictable and less easily accessible. But BMW is confident it has the right strategy to combat the challenges. I talked to BMW Board Member Ilka Horstmeier about how the company plans to cope with current automotive uncertainties.

BMW’s Bet On Electrification Is More Of A Hedge

BMW’s launch of the first Neue Klasse cars would imply that it’s focusing on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) just as US ambivalence towards electrification is growing. Indeed, the company ceased making internal combustion engines (ICE) at its oldest, flagship plant in Munich in November 2023, moving production to Steyr in Austria and Hams Hall in the UK. Instead, Munich will exclusively make BEVs, and BMW has simultaneously been retooling the plant for the Neue Klasse sedan while continuing to manufacture up to 1,000 cars a day.

However, the official BMW strategy, as explained to me recently by Chairman Oliver Zipse, is to keep its options open. As the US market for EVs softens while Europe and China press ahead, BMW’s global production footprint provides some resilience, and the ability to vary its plans by region. “We didn't need to adjust our strategy overall,” says Horstmeier. “Even three years ago, we were saying that we don't put all our eggs in one basket, because times are volatile. Even in Europe, the prerequisites for 100% electric are not there and will not be there until the 2030s. Either it's charging infrastructure or affordable green energy.”

BMW’s philosophy has long been that there is more to sustainable automaking than just switching to battery electric vehicles. “We remain technology open, while at the same time reducing the CO2 footprint of the whole value chain,” says Horstmeier. “This is what counts for climate change and not what the drivetrain of a car is. We don’t need to fundamentally change our strategy. We're adjusting volumes and what type of car we produce in which plant.” This strategy not only addresses the uneven transition to electro mobility, but also the tariff fluctuations that have buffeted the year so far. “You never know what's happening the next day. But the genetic code of our production network and system is flexibility. That's the reason why we can react better to changes than others. Most of our plants can produce all the drivetrains in their production system.”

BMW Facing Chip Challenges, But Batteries Remain Problematic

One change that BMW has been having to react to recently has been the chip supply issues caused by the Dutch government’s takeover of Nexperia and China’s reaction of limiting exports. “We have shown in the chip environment we had in 2021-22 that we are very adaptive with regard to these types of volatility,” argues Horstmeier, referring to a previous chip shortage that shocked the automotive market. “We are watching what is happening. We are in close contact with our suppliers regarding what they can supply daily. And we make decisions as late as possible, because that was the differentiator in 21-22 with that chip shortage. We always use our own flexibility instruments.” At the time of writing, the Nexperia chip challenge was showing signs of receding.

However, as the European market moves inexorably towards EVs, despite US reticence, a more fundamental weakness is evident: the lack of local battery production. “An electric car needs a battery, that's for sure,” says Horstmeier. This threat is accentuated by hard targets of ending internal combustion engine sales by 2035 in the EU and UK, which makes the lack of local battery supply a strategic threat to European automakers. “Every car manufacturer in that situation must look for resilience in their supply chain. But there are not that many options that we have. We use all suppliers. In the short term, the game has been played. But in the long term the biggest task for the European Union is to really think about how to allocate European battery production in Europe. I'm not talking about Chinese suppliers coming to Europe. I'm talking about really building up European battery manufacturing. This generation of batteries is done. We must look for the next generation and the whole supply chain, because it's not only battery and cell production, but also about all the raw materials you need. A strategic plan now in Europe to look for the next generation of batteries, and what we can do there, would be helpful. That's what we are talking about with the European Commission.”

Horstmeier isn’t implying that Europe has been caught doing nothing but argues that greater unity of purpose is required. She compares the situation to charging infrastructure, where manufacturers joined forces to create the necessary high-speed charging network for long-distance EV driving. BMW is part of the consortium behind IONITY, alongside Ford, Hyundai Motor Group, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group. “We have a lot of discussions in Europe about how to allocate battery production here,” she explains. But the first point is that we don’t only need battery production. If we look at resilient supply chains, we need raw materials. We need all the prerequisites for battery cell production. Then we must look for the production sites. It's a joint effort. In the next years, we must see whether we are all together and really move the needle in a different direction.”

From BMW Circularity To Solid State

Obtaining the necessary minerals for local European battery production is one reason why BMW sees its push towards recycling and a circular material economy as so crucial. With a circular recycling ecosystem, the minerals in existing batteries can be extracted to create new ones. That way, even if the batteries were originally imported, their minerals stay in Europe when built into new European vehicles.

That still leaves the issue of manufacturing. Europe has had obvious problems building up strong local battery cell production. Northvolt filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and the UK’s Britishvolt failed before even constructing a factory. “You need a couple of prerequisites,” says Horstmeier. “You need the raw materials. You need to understand where to get them from and how to secure them. You need the competency to build up cells efficiently.” Horstemeier argues that BMW is in a good position here because it has invested in a battery competence center, based in Munich, which opened in 2019. The company also has local high-voltage assembly plants in Woodruff, South Carolina (USA), Irlbach-Straßkirchen, Lower Bavaria (Germany), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China) and San Luis Potosí (Mexico). “We know what a battery looks like, but the industrialization and scaling are tricky tasks, even for experienced cell manufacturers. Whenever battery technology changes, it’s quite a while until production runs stable.”","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/690e2faf5242d8c03002f6c0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1553,873,x242,y459,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",N,,2025-11-08 14:03:36.642233

Congress and federal agencies are pursuing policies aimed at increasing financial resilience and spurring economic growth with this priority in mind, while also providing relief to millions of Americans and Main Streets across the country.

In my former role as president of America’s Credit Unions, I saw a program with a proven track record of success accomplish this goal. It is the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides federal grants for projects that drive business development, job creation, affordable housing and financial literacy.

Across the country, 1,400-plus institutions in this program provide more than $300 billion in financial services each year, serving communities that struggle with these issues, from rural and Native American communities to low-income neighborhoods across the country.

Unfortunately, as part of the ongoing government shutdown and resulting reduction-in-force plans, the entire staff of the fund received notice their positions are being eliminated. This raises huge questions about the future of the fund and the future of nearly 500 participating credit unions.

Every Community Development Financial Institution Fund dollar granted to a credit union generates $12 in private investment. This has helped credit unions invest $85 billion in community mortgage lending, $91 billion in local consumer financing, $30 billion in lending to local businesses and $18 billion in affordable small dollar loans and alternatives to payday loans.

For example, Lake Trust Credit Union has issued $5 million in microloans in Michigan by treating small business funding as personal loans, which results in approvals in days rather than weeks. This investment allows local entrepreneurs to launch and scale businesses while supporting their community.

The program offers on-site credit-builder loans, fee-free Health Savings Accounts and small emergency lines, helping owners retain talent while giving workers the tools to steady household budgets.

St. Louis Community Credit Union used its certification as a Community Development Financial Institution to invest more than $40 million in loans. The credit union serves more than 52,000 members and has been able to bridge the gap between mission-driven institutions and local entrepreneurs, channeling resources in ways that improve household stability, generate jobs, and fuel economic development.

Support for the fund is bipartisan and bicameral. Last month, the Senate included a package of improvements to the fund in its passage of the National Defense Authorization Act.

This provision would increase congressional oversight of the fund, expanding a congressional and regulatory foundation to offer safe credit, small business finance, affordable housing and wealth building.

A recent bicameral effort led by Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) highlighted the impact of these financial institutions to the Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget.

Government programs must be effective and cost efficient to protect taxpayers. The Community Development Financial Institution Fund is a nonpartisan program that meets these standards. With positive impact on communities, return on investment and strong bipartisan support, the fund’s dissolution is not the answer.

The fund works — it turns small amounts of federal dollars into truly impactful investments in communities. By preserving the fund, Congress will ensure it can meet its statutory mission once the shutdown ends.

We urge the administration to examine how the fund can support its priorities in financial resilience and economic growth, and, through this program, allow credit unions to continue unleashing domestic economic opportunity in communities across America.

Once certified, the state will send Shell’s permit to the EPA as part of Pennsylvania’s official Clean Air Act compliance plan.
Hilary Starcher-O’Toole is the executive director of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC).","The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection recently announced a plan to certify the Shell plastics plant’s air permit in Beaver County as meeting the federal “reasonably available control technology” (RACT) requirements for ozone pollution.

This certification, published in the Oct. 4 Pennsylvania Bulletin, claims that Shell’s permit already contains the necessary controls to meet the Clean Air Act’s 2015 ozone standards. I believe Shell’s dozens of notices of violation – including rolling 12-month exceedances of nitrogen oxides (NOx) – show otherwise.

As a lifelong Beaver County resident and executive director of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC), I find this determination deeply concerning. Residents living near Shell have endured repeated flaring events, strong chemical odors and air quality violations since the plant began operations. To suggest that Shell’s permit meets “best available” standards without transparent public review or meaningful on-site inspections by the DEP ispremature and disregards what Beaver County residents have witnessed firsthand.

Let’s be clear: NOx is a critical precursor to ozone formation. When a major facility like Shell repeatedly exceeds permitted NOx limits, the risks to local and downwind ozone levels don’t vanish. For context, Beaver County remains designated as a nonattainment area for ozone under the 2015 federal standard, meaning our air still fails to meet the health-based limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency. This designation reflects ongoing violations of national air quality standards meant to protect the public from smog-related respiratory and cardiovascular harm.

The DEP’s notice triggers a 30-day public comment period, which has been extended to Nov. 21. This is the public’s opportunity to demand accountability and insist that regulators fully examine the facility’s record of violations, equipment malfunctions and community impacts before granting federal certification.

Beaver County families deserve a permitting process based on evidence and accountability, not expedience.

Residents can submit comments to RA-EPAIRCOMMENTS@pa.gov through Nov. 21. They might also question why the public hearing was held in Allegheny County during work hours when Beaver County residents are the ones living with the consequences of ongoing malfunctions.

Please don’t underestimate this process. Once certified, the state will send Shell’s permit to the EPA as part of Pennsylvania’s official Clean Air Act compliance plan. This decision will shape how Shell is regulated for years to come. Our public comments become part of the official record – a reflection of whether we stood by silently or spoke out to defend the health of our families, neighbors and friends, and the future of our region when we had the chance.

Keep reading to uncover how the US government shutdown is shaking up travel plans and what you need to know to prepare.

The U.S. Government Shutdown: What Does it Mean for Your Flights?

The U.S. government shutdown is wreaking havoc across the nation, and airports are bearing the brunt of this financial disaster. Detroit, Honolulu, Orlando, Portland, Chicago, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Newark, and Anchorage are facing major flight reductions due to the shutdown.

Thousands of passengers are already feeling the consequences, and the worst is yet to come. In this article, we will expose the cold truth about how this government shutdown is directly impacting these key U.S. airports. If you’re flying soon, especially from these hubs, keep reading to uncover the devastating effects and how they will affect your plans.

Flight Cancellations Surge: What’s Behind the Chaos at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport?

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), a major hub in Michigan, is one of the first to face drastic cuts as a result of the U.S. government shutdown. Over 4% of flights at DTW have already been cancelled, with more disruptions expected. Experts are warning that if the shutdown continues, flight cancellations could surge by as much as 10%.

DTW is struggling under the weight of unpaid air traffic controllers, and the FAA has ordered reductions at 40 of the busiest airports nationwide. For Detroit, this means heightened stress, delays, and frustration for travelers. Already, dozens of people are stranded or forced to reschedule their flights as the airport struggles to keep up with demand.

The impact of the shutdown on DTW should not be underestimated. The airport is experiencing a sharp decline in flight reliability, and travellers can expect much longer waiting times. If you’re flying from Detroit, it’s essential to check your flight status frequently. This shutdown is not only disrupting your travel plans but also creating an unpredictable environment where flight operations could change without warning. The financial implications are enormous.

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Faces Flight Reductions Amid FAA Cuts

As of November 7, 2025, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) is among the airports affected by the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) flight reduction measures. This decision comes as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown continues to impact air traffic operations, leading to cancellations and delays at major airports across the country.

The FAA’s flight reduction initiative aims to alleviate strain on the air traffic control system, which is operating under reduced staffing due to the shutdown. As a result, travelers flying through DTW may experience disruptions, including flight cancellations, longer wait times, and delays in processing.

Stay Informed and Prepared

If you’re planning to travel through DTW in the coming days, it’s crucial to stay updated on your flight’s status. We recommend that passengers regularly check with their airline for real-time information on cancellations or changes to their flight schedule. With the FAA’s flight reductions in place, certain flights may be canceled, and the schedule could change unexpectedly.

To help you stay ahead of potential disruptions, here are some key tips for navigating these challenging conditions:

Download Your Airline’s App and Enable Notifications:

Most airlines offer apps that provide live updates and notifications. By enabling push notifications, you’ll receive the most accurate and immediate alerts about any changes to your flight, including cancellations, gate changes, and delays.

Check Your Flight Status Before Heading to the Airport:

Always verify your flight’s status with your airline before leaving for DTW. This simple step can save you time and ensure that you’re not caught off guard by last-minute cancellations or delays. Airline websites and mobile apps provide the most up-to-date information regarding your flight.

Ensure Your Contact Information is Current:

Make sure your airline has your correct and up-to-date contact information. Airlines often rely on this data to send crucial updates, such as schedule changes or flight cancellations. If you’ve changed your phone number or email address since booking, take a moment to update your details with the airline to ensure you don’t miss any important notifications.

Pack Your Patience:

Given the current situation, delays and cancellations are more likely, so it’s important to approach your travel with a sense of patience. With air traffic control and staffing issues at play, things may take longer than usual. Arriving early at the airport and allowing plenty of time for check-in and security is essential, especially if your flight is affected by the reduction measures.

The Impact on DTW and What It Means for Travelers

While DTW is a major hub for domestic and international flights, it is now facing the same challenges that other high-traffic airports are dealing with under the FAA’s flight reduction order. These cuts are necessary due to the reduced availability of air traffic controllers, many of whom are working without pay due to the ongoing government shutdown.

In light of these circumstances, the airport is urging travelers to be proactive and flexible with their plans. The Airport Authority, airlines, and federal partners are working diligently to manage the evolving situation, but the travel experience will inevitably be affected.

By staying informed and prepared, you can minimize the stress of these travel disruptions and ensure a smoother experience when flying through Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we all adapt to the challenges posed by the ongoing government shutdown.

Honolulu’s Travel Nightmare: Government Shutdown Forces Severe Flight Cuts

Honolulu International Airport (HNL), also known as Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, is another key player in the ongoing shutdown saga. The FAA has ordered drastic reductions here as well, even though Hawaii’s airports typically experience fewer disruptions.

HNL is a vital link between the U.S. mainland and the Pacific. For tourists and business travellers alike, this disruption is catastrophic. The government shutdown means less air traffic control staff, creating delays and increased risk of cancellations. Flights are being reduced by around 4%, and in the coming weeks, it’s likely this number will rise as more airports face strain.

Honolulu’s tourism industry, which is heavily reliant on smooth air travel, is feeling the pinch. The impact extends beyond just travellers — the entire Hawaiian economy will suffer unless swift action is taken. The government shutdown, at least for now, is casting a dark shadow over Hawaii’s bustling airport and further exacerbating the challenges for a destination already struggling with rising costs and visitor numbers.

Orlando International Airport: A Perfect Storm for Flight Disruptions

Orlando International Airport (MCO) is facing a perfect storm as the government shutdown escalates. With 4% of flights already being slashed, the pressure is mounting on the city’s busiest gateway. And that’s not the worst of it — experts are warning that the airport could experience up to a 10% reduction in flights, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded during the busy holiday season.

For those travelling to Orlando for family vacations or business, the situation is becoming more precarious. The city’s theme parks, conventions, and events depend heavily on uninterrupted flight schedules, but now that dream is shattering. Airports like MCO are the first to feel the impact, with delays and cancellations worsening by the day. Airlines are scrambling to accommodate passengers, but the reality is, there is only so much they can do when the very systems they rely on are compromised by the shutdown.

Expect your Orlando trip to be fraught with unexpected delays and longer-than-usual wait times. The longer the shutdown drags on, the worse it gets, and the 10% reduction forecast is just the beginning. If you have a flight booked from Orlando, the situation is only going to get worse.

Portland International Airport Faces Growing Strain from US Shutdown

Portland International Airport (PDX) is not immune to the ongoing chaos. With the FAA slashing air traffic at 40 airports, Portland has found itself caught in the crossfire. The growing strain on resources is evident as more cancellations are reported each day.

PDX is a smaller airport compared to some of the others on this list, but it’s still a crucial hub for those travelling across the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately, the government shutdown means fewer staff, longer wait times, and a higher likelihood of flight delays.

Local reports indicate that delays could worsen in the coming weeks, with travellers facing an uncertain future. As air traffic control issues compound the challenges at PDX, passengers are urged to remain vigilant, prepared for longer waits, and ready to adjust their travel plans.

Chicago Midway International Airport Faces Major Flight Cancellations

Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW) is another major airport grappling with the fallout of the shutdown. Known for its high volume of Southwest Airlines flights, MDW is already experiencing delays, and with over 4% of flights cancelled, things aren’t looking good for passengers flying in and out of this key hub.

Midway’s status as a secondary airport in the Windy City doesn’t shield it from the chaos wreaking havoc on major airports. Flight cancellations and delays are inevitable as the FAA struggles to cope with the ongoing staffing shortages. For travellers, the message is clear: If you’re flying out of Chicago Midway, expect to encounter problems that could cause major disruptions to your schedule.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport: A Disaster in the Making

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is one of the busiest airports in the world and certainly one of the most important for air travel in the U.S. With the government shutdown affecting air traffic control operations nationwide, ATL is struggling to keep up.

Already, passengers are seeing flight cancellations, delays, and unpredictable flight schedules. The 10% reduction forecast for high-traffic airports like ATL will cause significant issues. The airport’s size and volume mean the number of disruptions is far greater here than at many other airports.

For those planning to travel through ATL, expect long lines, increased stress, and potentially even flight rerouting. The FAA’s mandated reductions are taking a toll on all U.S. airports, and ATL is no exception. With the shutdown likely to continue, the pressure on air travel is set to mount even further.

Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport: More Trouble Amid Shutdown

The impact of the government shutdown is not just confined to the major hubs. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) is also feeling the pinch. Although it doesn’t boast the same volume of traffic as some of the larger airports, CVG is still a critical airport for regional flights.

Passengers here are facing reduced services and higher chances of cancellations as the shutdown reduces FAA oversight. While the airport may not face the same sheer volume of disruption as larger airports, those flying from CVG should still prepare for significant delays and service reductions.

Newark Liberty International Airport Faces Worsening Travel Disruptions

Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is on the frontline of the ongoing shutdown. As one of the largest international airports in the country, Newark is bracing for an influx of cancellations. The 4% flight reduction initially forecast could escalate quickly, leading to delays, cancellations, and more passenger frustration.

For passengers trying to catch international flights or connecting through Newark, this means potential chaos. Already, major airlines are warning of potential disruptions as the shutdown continues, and Newark is at the centre of these changes.

Anchorage International Airport Struggles to Cope with Shutdown Chaos

Anchorage International Airport (ANC) may be remote, but that hasn’t shielded it from the fallout of the government shutdown. As the FAA reduces flight capacity across the country, even this less-busy airport is seeing the effects. Anchorage’s role as a key hub for Alaskan and international flights has made it vulnerable to disruptions.

For those travelling through ANC, the shutdown will likely create delays, especially on flights that rely on specific air traffic control staffing. While the shutdown might not have the same magnitude of impact here as in other cities, travellers should remain cautious and monitor their flight status closely.

FAA Announces Flight Reductions Amid U.S. Government Shutdown to Ensure Air Travel Safety

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Bryan Bedford outlined proactive measures to ensure the highest safety standards in the national airspace system during the ongoing government shutdown. These measures include a temporary 10 percent reduction in flights at 40 high-traffic airports across the country.

Since the shutdown began, air traffic controllers have been working without pay, leading to mounting staffing issues at air traffic facilities nationwide. This strain on the system has resulted in increased delays and concerns about safety, with 2,740 delays reported just this past weekend.

“This isn’t about politics – it’s about assessing the data and alleviating the risks as controllers continue to work without pay,” said Secretary Duffy. “It’s safe to fly today, and it will continue to be safe next week because of the proactive actions we are taking.”

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford added, “We are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely.”

Flight Reductions Timeline and Key Actions

A 4 percent reduction in operations will take effect Friday, November 7, with gradual increases:

6 percent by November 11

8 percent by November 13

10 percent by November 14

Additionally, the FAA will impose restrictions on certain operations:

Prohibit some visual flight rule approaches (VFR) at affected facilities.

Commercial space launches and reentries will be restricted to 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time.

Parachute operations and photo missions near impacted facilities will be prohibited.

These actions are based on the FAA’s review of aviation safety data, including voluntary, confidential safety reports filed by pilots and air traffic controllers. The data points to increased stress, which heightens safety risks.

Refunds and International Flights

Airlines are required to issue full refunds for affected flights, though secondary costs, such as accommodations, will not be covered. Importantly, the FAA’s flight reduction measures do not extend to international flights. Carriers will have the discretion to decide which domestic flights to cancel to meet the required reductions.

The list of 40 impacted high-traffic airports includes major hubs like Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Honolulu International Airport (HNL), and Orlando International Airport (MCO), among others.

Solar power is now the fastest, most economical way to introduce more kilowatts into the US grid, and things are about to get a lot more interesting. Traditional silicon solar cells are relatively expensive and difficult to manufacture compared to the up-and-coming crop of photovoltaic technologies to emerge from the lab. In particular, new perovskite solar cells are finally beginning to hit the marketplace.

The Perovskite Solar Cell Story

The first practical silicon solar cell was introduced by Bell Labs in New Jersey back in 1954. However, widespread adoption is a 21st century phenomenon, spurred by accelerating cycles of falling costs and rising demand, leading to economies of scale that force prices down even farther with every cycle.

Those cycles will continue to pick up steam in the coming years. Although solar is already competitive with fossil fuels in many markets globally, solar innovators have not stopped trying to push the cost of solar cells down even farther, and perovskites are part of the effort.

Perovskites are lab-grown crystals that follow the structure of calcium titanate, also found in the mineral perovskite. By way of illustrating the rapid pace of innovation today, perovskite was first identified in nature back in 1839. However, its application to solar cells did not surface for another 170 years. A team of researchers in Japan reported the first perovskite solar cell in 2009, with a solar conversion efficiency of 3.8%. Today, just 16 years later, researchers around the world are routinely hitting double digits for perovskite solar conversion efficiency (see more perovskite background here).

Solving The Perovskite Solar Cell Puzzle

The road to a marketable perovskite solar cell has been a relatively short one, but a difficult one. Perovskites are extremely fragile, defying practical applications until researchers could figure out how to engineer durability and longevity without sacrificing solar conversion efficiency.

One promising workaround is a tandem approach that deploys layers of perovskites and silicon. Silicon is the longtime semiconductor of choice for mass-marketed solar cells. It is relatively expensive compared to perovskites, so combining the two yields a high-efficiency solar cell that is less expensive than silicon alone. The tandem approach also delivers a lighter, more flexible solar cell than silicon alone.

Among the innovators focusing on tandem perovskite solar cells is the US startup Swift Solar. The company is new to the pages of CleanTechnica, so a bit of catchup is in order.

The Acid Test For Perovskite Durability

Swift Solar co-founder and MIT engineer Joel Jean introduced his company’s perovskite solar cells in 2019. The company has focused on stacking different types of perovskites in a solar cell, boosting efficiency by absorbing different parts of the solar spectrum. As of 2019, Jean anticipated a solar conversion efficiency potential of more than 30% for its all-perovskite tandem solar cells.

The company has since adopted tandem perovskite-silicon technology while ramping into manufacturing mode. “Swift Solar’s proprietary next-generation perovskite tandem technology outperforms legacy silicon solar technologies, generating up to 30% more power than today’s solar panels,” the company asserts.

In August of this year, Swift’s US-made perovskite tandem solar cells were featured in the Defense Department’s annual Cyber Fortress exercise in Virginia, hosted by the 91st Cyber Brigade at Fort Belvoir and the Information Operations Support Center of the Virginia National Guard.

This year’s exercise focused in preparedness for a cyberattack on an electric cooperative (electric cooperatives are member-supported utilities that form the backbone of the US power grid), featuring multiple US agencies as well as students, electric co-ops, and representatives from other countries, including Finland, Sweden, Latvia.

As part of the exercise, Swift’s technology was integrated with a hybrid microgrid engineered by the firm Resilient Energy & Infrastructure. “Swift Solar’s perovskite tandem solar panels provided clean energy alongside two other power sources during a critical infrastructure cyber defense exercise,” Swift explains.

“DoD leadership, Army operational energy specialists, and private sector partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS) were on hand to learn about and observe the DoD’s latest operational energy capabilities,” Swift adds.

A Next-Level, Solar-Enabled Microgrid For The DoD

“The exercise demonstrated the potential for Swift Solar’s technology to support energy resilience for national defense operations,” Swift concludes.

Don’t just take their word for it. In a press release dated October 24, Swift cited the Cyber Fortress Lead for the US Army, Dr. Andre Slonopas, who reported that “US-made perovskite solar technology can directly address the growing power demands of the modern battlefield and enhance overall military readiness.”

As for solar technology in general, don’t just take Slonopas’s word for it, either. The US Army has been pushing the market for solar-enabled microgrids and lightweight, transportable solar technology since the early 2000s, to help secure a more nimble, flexible, scavenge-able power supply for the geared-up Soldier of today.

Resilient CEO Paul Maloney also chipped his two cents into Swift’s press release, taking note of the potential for perovskite solar cells to take his company’s “Rapid Deployment Hybrid MicroGrid” technology to the next level.

“For our mobile RDHMs, where space, weight, and agility are mission-critical factors for operational energy, we envision Swift Solar’s perovskite as vastly increasing the energy density we can deploy, while enhancing energy resilience for military operations,” Maloney explained.

Resilient is laser-focused on integrating solar and energy storage into transportable microgrids. Its portfolio includes the proprietary “SolFlex” solar array, designed to unfold and fold back up, accordion-style, enabling the entire system to be recovered and transported elsewhere. “Key facet: No stranded asset risk,” the company emphasizes.

“REI’s objective is to address a significant disequilibrium between legacy, inefficient, and antiquated centralized systems and more modern, resilient, and efficiency-optimized distributed systems-of-systems,” Resilient emphasizes again for good measure.

Next Steps For The US Solar Industry

Beyond the potential for use in microgrids, Swift indicates that DoD is also interested in electromagnetic applications and space-based missions, among other fields. With plans to scale up its manufacturing systems over the next two years, Swift takes note of private sector interest among leading industries, including power generation, satellite operations, and telecommunications.

No kidding. It’s difficult to make an economical case for any other power generation resource in the US under the current state of energy technology today, with the ability to address mobile and transportable energy needs on up to utility-scale power plants. If you can think of one, drop a note in the comment thread.

Even though it would seem that the United States, Mexico, and Canada are in an era of increasing political tension and division, the common strategic priorities of the North American bloc far overshadow the divergences and competing interests. Strengthening energy trade and mutual support to ramp up energy production and localized energy and manufacturing supply chains would be a win-win-win for all three parties, but will require a particularly heavy lift on the part of Mexico.

“Within this trilateral relationship,” reports the Atlantic Council, “Mexico’s role in particular could lean into its domestic priorities to expand energy infrastructure, strengthen its electric vehicle and semiconductor sectors, and develop its mineral wealth.”

The Atlantic Council, a longstanding bipartisan think tank dedicated to issues of international coordination and security, recently released a 14-page policy brief arguing for enhanced cooperation between North American nations in order to be able to compete with China in global energy value chains. As Mexico, Canada, and the United States have prioritized protectionist policies and fractured nationalism over the last decade, China has increasingly consolidated global supply chains and currently exerts a great deal of control over international energy markets, especially in emerging economies. The Atlantic Council argues that counteracting this precarious consolidation will require a course correction and a return to convergence, coordination, and cooperation on the part of North American nations, who will stand stronger together than divided in a rapidly changing global market.

While the governments of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have had loud and contentious tiffs against the backdrop of the Trump administrations (see: 51st state, wall) the three economies remain highly dependent on each other, and politically entangled in inextricable and bilateral ways. Smoothing over trade tensions in light of those dependencies is therefore strongly in the nations’ favor.

Although China is unmatched in terms of energy spending and its rapid expansion of energy influence, supply chains, and investment into energy assets in emerging economies, the Atlantic Council argues that North America is well-positioned to challenge China’s runaway dominance if it can play to its historic strengths.

“North America’s energy abundance has positioned the region as the world’s dominant energy exporter,” states the October policy brief. “The United States leads global LNG exports, Canada supplies critical oil and gas resources, and Mexico’s emerging Pacific Coast LNG projects will provide direct access to Asian markets. This collective export capacity creates shared prosperity through export revenues while offering democratic allies alternatives to authoritarian energy suppliers, transforming energy integration from an economic opportunity into a geopolitical asset.”

This plan hinges on Mexico’s ambitious energy planning – including the Plan Mexico policy – as laid out by its new president Claudia Sheinbaum. Mexico is critical to the nearshoring ambitions of the United States and Canada, who seek to shorten and strengthen localized supply chains in the interest of energy security, independence, and sovereignty, not to mention increased control within global markets. Mexico also has enormous and largely untapped potential for green energy production.

“Through Plan Mexico, the current administration has outlined an ambitious economic transformation strategy that prioritizes manufacturing growth, critical mineral development, and energy security—priorities that align with US and Canadian interests in building more resilient regional supply chains,” writes the Atlantic Council.

Increased North American energy cooperation is also critical to keeping Mexico’s alliances pointed north rather than East. China has been rapidly expanding its presence in energy sectors across Latin America, and Mexico would be a highly strategic trade partner for Beijing. Isolating and alienating Mexico from North American cooperation would push the country toward Beijing, with likely disastrous consequences for policy and economic goals for the entire continent.

Sweden is also one of the world’s most generous international climate finance donors, which contributes to both emissions reduction and climate adaptation.

Sweden highlights the Swedish business community’s solutions for reduced emissions and greater resilience, and how such solutions can contribute to a faster transition. After the UN Climate Change Conference COP29 in Baku, Minister for Climate and the Environment Romina Pourmokhtari and Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade Benjamin Dousa sent a letter to the parties to the Paris Agreement to highlight that there are a number of technical solutions and innovations that could already be applied in climate work and that Swedish companies can offer.

Sweden as the climate matchmaker

Business Sweden published its report ‘Sweden – The Climate Matchmaker for Global Action’ report during UN Climate Week in September 2025. The report has been produced for COP30 to help countries match their climate challenges with existing Swedish solutions and thereby dare to raise the ambition of their national climate plans (NDCs) and make them more feasible and attractive for public and private investment.

The Swedish offering is embodied in the ‘Sweden – The Climate Matchmaker’ campaign, in which areas of interest can be matched with solutions.

Business Sweden is responsible for the Swedish Pavilion at COP30 and will also bring a delegation of Swedish government agencies and companies from a number of different sectors to COP30.

A generous donor of international climate finance

Sweden is one of the world’s most generous donors of international climate finance. This will contribute to both emissions reductions and climate adaptation. Through climate aid, Sweden contributed to the world reaching the goal of USD 100 billion in global climate finance a year by 2022. Since then, the Swedish Government has made substantial investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of climate aid. In 2024, Swedish climate aid reached a record high at just over SEK 11.1 billion, an increase of SEK 1.5 billion compared to the previous year. Compared with 2022, this is an increase of around SEK 2.5 billion, approximately 29 per cent.

Sweden is one of the largest donors to multilateral development banks and climate funds such as the Global Environment Fund and the Green Climate Fund.

The government agencies play an important role

Several Swedish government agencies are working on support for capacity building and climate investments on behalf of the Government.

The Swedish Energy Agency

The Swedish Energy Agency is responsible for Sweden’s international climate action programme. The aim is to develop international collaborations and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

The Swedish Energy Agency is working to develop international climate cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. As a result, Sweden today has cooperation agreements under the Paris Agreement with a number of countries, for example, Ghana, Kenya and Nepal, and cooperates with various international organisations.

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency conducts a number of bilateral collaborations with a large number of countries in various projects in the field of environment and climate. This makes it possible to develop effective environmental administration and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda and to Sweden’s own environmental quality objectives.

One example is the Strengthening Zambian Mining Governance in The Nexus of Environment, Human Rights, and Climate (ZAMNEX) programme, which aims to improve the sustainability of the Zambian mining sector with focus on aspects of the environment, human rights and climate change. This project concluded in September 2026.

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency also has the role of national focal point for gender equality and climate change under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement states that the climate transition must take place with regard to human rights and that it must promote gender equality. Gender equality has been part of the Climate Convention since 2001 and is now a permanent agenda item at meetings of the parties. In 2025, a new action plan is expected to be adopted at COP30 in Belém.

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is responsible for Sweden’s development cooperation. It focuses on the themes that are considered especially important for combating global poverty, including climate and the environment. Sida’s bilateral support goes to 36 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe.

Sida specifically works with climate and the environment through targeted projects and climate and environment programmes; climate- and environmental integration within other sectors dialogue and policy advocacy and capital mobilisation.

Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50% over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office.
This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging and wildcat mining.
This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.
“Cop30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation.","Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rainforest and its people.

But with a divided administration, a hostile Congress and 20th-century developmentalist instincts, this global figurehead of the centre left has a balancing act to perform in advocating protection of nature and a reduction of emissions.

At the opening of the summit on Thursday, he said his priority was social development, but humanity had to make an energy transition and halt the loss of forests.

He said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to – in a fair and planned way – reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”

Those difficulties and contradictions have been starkly apparent in recent months, in which the government has announced impressive progress in reducing deforestation, while also pushing forward a number of projects that would open up the Amazon to extractivism.

First, the good news. Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50% over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office. The latest annual government figures show the smallest area of clearance in 11 years. This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging and wildcat mining.

As a result, the Climate Observatory estimates Brazil’s emissions – which are mainly determined by the health of its forests – have fallen by 16.7%, likely to be the steepest fall of any of the G20 economies.

These gains were front and centre as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at Cop30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125bn (£95bn) for the protection of standing forests. So far, the initiative has raised about $5.5bn, with investments of $3bn from Norway, $1bn each from Brazil and Indonesia, and smaller sums from Portugal, the Netherlands and other countries.

The money is desperately needed to stave off the rapidly growing danger that the world’s biggest tropical forest will decline beyond a point of no return, after which it will be condemned to desiccate into a savannah and lose much of its globally important functions of climate stabilisation, water transport and habitat provision.

Senior scientists have warned that this is already happening in wide areas of the Amazon, particularly in the states of Matto Grosso, where there has been a rapid expansion of soy plantations, and Pará, where the primary cause of destruction is the beef industry. The weakening of the forest has also been accelerated by fire (widely used for land clearance) and the contamination of rivers with mercury (which is used in gold mining).

Antonio Donato Nobre, an Earth system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown. He said droughts are increasingly severe, temperatures in some cleared areas have increased by up to 7C and degradation is accelerating even as deforestation slows. This poses a global threat, he said, not only because of a reduced carbon sequestration capacity, but because a weaker rainforest means less cloud cover to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, which is potentially a greater warming threat than greenhouse gases.

Nobre said the first climate summit in the Amazon was an opportunity to put nature at the heart of climate solutions but could also be a disaster if leaders paid only lip service to the importance of the forest, while pushing ahead with destructive projects. “My main message is get serious,” he said. “The most successful enterprise on the planet is called life. We have in our hands a technology that is 4bn years old and has gone through multiple cycles of destruction and rebirth and refixing.”

Lula, however, relies on support from the agribusiness and mining sectors to maintain power. “Ruralista” politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation. This lobby is now the driving force in Brazilian politics.

While Lula has vetoed some of its most radical plans to eradicate swathes of environmental licensing requirements, he has also appeared more than willing to support other elements of its agenda to carve up the Amazon and other biomes for the production of fossil fuels and monoculture crops.

Three weeks ago, his government approved drilling licences for oil and gas exploration at the Foz do Amazonas off the coast of the rainforest, a move that adds to the contamination risks facing the forest, increases the likelihood of vegetation destruction by related industries and runs contrary to advice from the International Energy Agency that it will be impossible to achieve the Paris agreement goals of limiting global heating unless countries completely halt new fossil fuel development.

Then there are the government’s plans to upgrade the BR-319 highway between Manaus and Porto Velho, which will put unprecedented pressure on the western regions of the Brazilian Amazon, which have – until now – been one of the last healthy regions of the forest.

Another large intact area is close to the north-west border with Venezuela, but this too is menaced by plans to permit industrial mining in the Yanomami Indigenous territory.

“We’re very worried,” said one of those in the region, Ehuana Yaira Yanomami, who has come to Belém to relay the fears of the women of her community. “We don’t want our people to suffer, we are very worried and that’s why we are speaking out, because illegal mining only brings suffering to our communities. We want to see our children healthy, without mud and without the fish being contaminated.”

Farther south, the government announced in late August it would “de-statise” the federal waterways of three major rivers – the Tapajós, Madeira and Tocantins – which is seen as a first step towards their privatisation and transformation into a “hydrovia” water transport route for soy shipped from Mato Grosso.

Lula, who cut his political teeth as a union negotiator, has tended to focus more on the social benefits that can come from increased investment in the Amazon, while skirting the far greater risks that the climate crisis poses to its human and non-human residents.

That was evident last week at a pre-Cop30 publicity tour of forest communities along the Tapajós river. At the Vista Alegre do Capixauã village of the Kumaruara people, the president said he was ready to stand up for those who protect the forests, and promised to improve local healthcare, education and housing. This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.

But during the parts of his visit open to the press, Lula did not make a single mention of the climate, even though this is a growing concern for local people – and a huge majority of the world’s population.

The head of a neighbouring village, Luis Antonio Bentes de Sousa, told the Guardian that much of the river dried up during last year’s record drought, leaving the communities here stranded and struggling to feed themselves. He said his vegetable garden shrivelled up, most of his fruit trees died and for the first time in his 70-year-life he was unable to grow manioc, the primary staple of the Amazon diet.

“It is getting hotter and drier,” he said. “I worry for my children and grandchildren.”

Others spoke of mass fish deaths due to the heat, contamination and low water levels, and expressed fears that this will become worse when the river they depend on is privatised and turned into a canal for soy barges.

These uncomfortable topics – and their politically difficult solutions – were not raised during the speeches until the very end of Lula’s visit when the environment minister, Marina Silva, asked for the microphone and reminded the president why they were in the Amazon this month. “Cop30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation. And the world needs to do its part, reducing emissions of coal, oil and gas. That is why I like it when, sir, you say it’s necessary to stop depending on fossil fuels.”

This was a reminder that in Belém, Lula – like many world leaders – will have a good forest angel on one shoulder and a fossil fuel demon on the other. The question is which will hold sway.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff3fb126efe16c4fcbe1d627a34b454942162e3/261_0_2629_2104/master/2629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93a95f75d05e06959e34d9ac841e6d34",N,,2025-11-08 11:05:12.359826

This month, the global spotlight turns to the environment and our collective efforts to combat climate change as COP30 convenes in Brazil. A decade on from the landmark Paris Agreement, world leaders are gathering to assess progress and chart a path forward to limit and prepare for climate change.

Europe is now warming twice as fast as the global average and the consequences of extreme weather are already being felt, from prolonged periods of water scarcity to increasingly frequent storms and flooding.

Yet, as the latest IPPR poll highlights, the environment doesn’t exist in isolation. While over half of Scots still view climate action as vital to the nation’s future, pressing concerns such as the NHS, cost of living and inequality currently top the public agenda.

Now, more than ever before, it’s important to recognise that the environment is not only at the heart of our identity as a nation but also integral to our success and development. We’re committed to taking action and one of the ways we’re doing this is through the nationally recognised Carbon Literacy Project, a training initiative where we’re equipping colleagues with the knowledge and tools to embed climate-conscious decision-making into everything they do, both at work and at home.

To mark Climate Literacy Action Day, this year taking place to coincide with COP30, we’re hosting staff sessions and expanding accreditation so our people can integrate climate decision-making into all aspects of their roles.

Preparing for a winter of extremes

As we head into another unpredictable winter, the swing between drought and downpour is becoming a familiar pattern. Last winter, some areas were drenched with above-average rainfall, while others saw less than half their usual precipitation.

The message is clear, winter preparedness now means being ready for both water shortages and flooding. With climate change reshaping seasonal norms, resilience depends on acting early, making informed choices, and working together across communities.

And yes, it’s possible to face both flooding and water scarcity at the same time. When heavy rain hits dry ground, it runs off like water on concrete, flooding streets but barely touching river levels. It’s all about timing; scarcity builds slowly, while flooding hits fast.

Prepare and be aware of flooding this winter

As winter approaches, communities across Scotland face an increased risk of flooding brought on by heavy rainfall, saturated ground and extreme weather events.

Flooding can affect you. It might be where you live, or your regular travel routes. Being prepared is key to staying safe and minimising disruption. We’re urging you to take action now to be prepared this winter by taking these easy steps:

Check the Scottish Flood Forecast - This provides a three-day outlook that shows when and where flooding is expected.

Sign up to Floodline - Receive real-time Alerts and Warnings direct by text, phone call or email, allowing you to take action when flooding is expected.

Follow our social media channels - We provide information on predicted flooding in advance through Facebook and X.

Why we need to prepare for water scarcity this winter

Winter is traditionally seen as a time of water abundance, but recent trends tell a different story. In 2024, Scotland experienced a notably dry winter, with many regions recording below-average rainfall. The situation continued into 2025 with record-breaking dry conditions. These repeated dry spells placed sustained pressure on our rivers, keeping them under strain throughout the year.

While rivers are naturally resilient to seasonal fluctuations, prolonged low flows disrupt ecological balance and slow recovery. Consecutive years of reduced flow increase the risk of long-term or even irreversible changes to river ecosystems.

As we enter the winter months, all of Scotland’s rivers have recovered, with all areas at Alert level or below, and all abstraction restrictions lifted across the country.

However, the situation is delicate. That’s why we’re encouraging businesses, especially in agriculture, food production and manufacturing to be ready by integrating climate resilience into their planning.

If you rely on large amounts of water for your business:

Assess your water use - You should review how much water you use and identify areas where consumption can be reduced or recycled.

Engage with SEPA tools and guidance - You can access our water scarcity seasonal reports during the winter months, along with guidance to make informed decisions.

Collaborate locally - Work with suppliers, local authorities and environmental groups to help share resources and strategies.

Latest Scottish household waste statistics highlight progress

Scotland’s latest household waste statistics have revealed a modest rise in recycling rates for 2024. While 44.3% of household waste was successfully recycled, we know that more than half of what ends up in general waste bins, such as food scraps, paper, cardboard and plastics, could have been recycled.

The carbon impact of household waste in 2024 was 5.31 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, marking a 21.5% decrease since 2011. This reduction underscores the environmental benefits of recycling and waste minimisation, especially as Scotland moves toward its goal of a circular economy.

With research showing that over half of general bin contents could be recycled, small changes in household habits, like better sorting and reducing food waste, could significantly boost recycling rates and cut emissions. Every effort counts in supporting Scotland’s transition to a more sustainable future.

Celebration or contamination? What bonfire night means for air quality

Across the country this week, skies have been lit with fireworks and bonfires as communities gathered for a night of sparkle and celebration. But while we enjoyed the show, it’s worth remembering that these fiery festivities come with a few hidden extras, especially for the air we breathe.

As the bonfires blaze and fireworks bang, they release tiny particles into the air, such as soot (black carbon) and colourful metal compounds like lead, copper and barium. These are what give fireworks their dazzling colours and crackling sounds, but they also contribute to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5), which can hang around in the air and irritate our lungs.

In previous years, our air quality monitors have picked up noticeable spikes in PM2.5 across Scotland between 5p.m. and 9p.m, right when the celebrations are in full swing. The levels didn’t last long, but they’re usually some of the highest of the week, showing just how much one night of fun can impact the air around us.

Explore the impact our daily lives can have on local air quality by having a look at some data collected during a citizen science project in Stirlingshire. This includes data from Aberfoyle’s bonfire night celebrations.

Extending the life of our assets to support net zero

As part of our ongoing efforts to modernise and reshape our workspaces, we’ll soon be co-locating with Zero Waste Scotland and the Water Industry Commission for Scotland in Stirling city centre. This move supports our net zero ambitions by promoting more sustainable travel, collaborative working and efficient use of shared resources.

Clearing our existing Stirling workspace became a practical demonstration of sustainability in action. Faced with vacating the space, we collaborated to repurpose surplus furniture and IT equipment. Extending the life of our assets has reduced waste and redistributed resources to support colleagues and communities. This approach helped cut emissions, avoid unnecessary procurement, and showed how smarter use of public sector assets delivers real environmental and social value.

""It's essentially a hoax. It's not an honest organization looking to better human lives,"" Wright told The Associated Press at the close of a two-day business conference in Athens. He added that he might attend next year's summit ""just to try to deliver some common sense.""

Wright's comments came as world leaders gathering over 5,000 miles away, on the edge of the Amazon in Brazil, blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for his absence from the United Nations-sponsored discussions on climate change running through Nov. 21. His remarks echoed the U.S. administration's rejection of global climate agreements and Trump's prioritization of fossil fuels.

The U.S. will send no high-level officials to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, the White House said Friday.

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.

Wright led a senior U.S. delegation to Athens for talks centered on boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe and Ukraine. Among them were Interior secretary Doug Burgum, deputy secretaries and the new U.S. ambassador to Greece and close Trump ally, Kimberly Guilfoyle.

At the forum, top U.S. officials criticized European Union carbon reduction policies, arguing they undermine economic growth, democratic alliances, and global leadership in AI and energy innovation.

It was a stark contrast with the Brazilian city of Belem, where world leaders at COP30 issued urgent warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming, driven in large part by emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said a ""moral failure"" to act would trigger rising hunger, displacement and environmental damage.

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.

Latin American leaders attending COP30 in Belem took swipes at Trump for his stance on climate discussions.

""Today Mr. Trump is against humanity. His absence is proof of that,"" Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said in his speech on Thursday. ""What should we do then? Leave him alone. Oblivion is the biggest punishment.""

Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva struck a more moderate tone regarding Trump's absence, expressing hope that his U.S. counterpart would eventually change his mind.

""President Trump told me he doesn't believe in green energy,"" Lula told reporters earlier this week. ""He will believe in it, because he'll realize that we don't have much of an alternative.""

Trump wasn't the only one staying away; the summit was also notably absent of leaders from China and India. Together, these three nations are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Wright, a former fossil fuel executive who has been a leading voice against efforts to fight climate change, defended Washington's stance, arguing that global gatherings should prioritize energy access, growth and technological advancement over what he described as fear-driven environmentalism.

""Gatherings of global leaders and businesses should be about humans ... not on the desire to scare children and grow government power,"" he told the AP in Athens. ""They've lost the plot.""

The Belem talks opened as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, the World Meteorological Organization reported Thursday.

Trump has reversed Biden's focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. ""energy dominance"" in the global market. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he called climate change ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

At the start of his second term, Trump again withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, while the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations.

Transitioning to a fossil fuel-free economy isn’t just about fighting climate change, it’s about creating a healthier, more affordable, sustainable and stable future.","It’s true that manufacturing EVs and solar panels currently generates carbon emissions. However, when we look at the full lifecycle — “cradle to grave” — EVs produce significantly less CO2 than gasoline-powered cars. The emissions from a gasoline car are not limited to what comes out of the tailpipe. We must consider the entire “well to wheels” process: drilling for oil, transporting crude, refining it, shipping gasoline to stations, and finally burning it in engines that are only about 30% efficient (70% turned into heat and wasted). Each step adds pollution and greenhouse gases to our environment. This goes on for the entire life of the gasoline-powered car. There is no practical pathway to “carbon-free” with a gasoline car.

For solar panels, emissions are concentrated during manufacturing (mining, refining, panel production). Average carbon payback period is one to four years, meaning they offset their production emissions within that time. After payback, they generate electricity with near-zero emissions for 25-30 years. Another great advantage of rooftop solar is a locked-in price for each and every kilowatt-hour. No worries about inflation, AI and crypto raising the cost of electricity. You can go solar with either a zero-cost power purchase agreement from a company like Atlasta Solar or by purchasing solar panels outright at a reduced cost through a co-op like Solar United Neighbors.

Back to EVs; even though tailpipe emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles are often invisible, they contain a potent mix of harmful pollutants that can make us sick. These include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, fine particulates, and unburned hydrocarbons like benzene and formaldehyde — both known carcinogens. Despite their invisibility, these compounds contribute to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and long-term environmental damage, silently affecting the air we breathe and the health of our communities. You also subject yourself to a cocktail of chemicals every time you pump gas. Some benign, some not so much. Let’s not forget that medicine itself is a major consumer of single-use plastics, so anything that lowers our need for health care also helps reduce waste, pollution and energy consumption.

Financially, EVs are much cheaper to operate. The lifetime cost of driving on electricity is far lower than buying gasoline, especially as global instability affects oil prices. Routine maintenance is also less expensive, since EVs have fewer moving parts and don’t require oil changes. Consider the cost of driving 10,000 miles. A gasoline car getting 20 mpg will consume 500 gallons of gasoline to go that far. Assuming a low price of $5 per gallon this would take $2,500 out of your pocket. An EV consuming 30 kWhs to drive 100 miles would consume 3,000 kWhs. At offpeak Xcel rates of 8.5 cents per kWh, this would take $255 out of your pocket. Less if you have rooftop solar. Driving a gas car could easily have fuel costs more than 10 times as much as an EV charged at home. More than 80% of EV charging is done at home. We charge 100% at home. But what the heck! You don’t mind working part time for the oil oligarchs, do you.

Envision an electrified future where all manufacturing and transportation does not create carbon dioxide and all people are freed from the tyranny of oil. If a war breaks out in the Middle East, gasoline could easily hit $10 per gallon or higher and there’s nothing you can do about it. Meanwhile, the cost of driving electric will be virtually unchanged, especially if you make your own ‘fuel’ on your roof. Your choice.

Transitioning to a fossil fuel-free economy isn’t just about fighting climate change, it’s about creating a healthier, more affordable, sustainable and stable future. Investing in clean energy isn’t just affordable — it’s the key to securing America’s prosperity and leadership for generations to come.

Navigating the Future of Rare Earth Markets China's rare earth export controls have fundamentally transformed global supply chain assumptions and strategic planning requirements across critical technology sectors.","Understanding Beijing's Strategic Mineral Restrictions

China's rare earth export controls represent a sophisticated regulatory framework that transforms critical minerals from market commodities into strategic diplomatic leverage. The licensing mechanism, administered through China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), establishes government oversight over materials essential to modern technology manufacturing.

The Foundation of Modern Export Control Policy

The current licensing system emerged from decades of policy evolution, moving from open market competition toward strategic resource management. MOFCOM's authority stems from China's foreign trade law framework, enabling rapid implementation of export restrictions across defined material categories. As of November 2025, the ministry had issued 62 regulatory announcements pertaining to export controls, with specific announcements suspended until November 2026 according to official statements.

Furthermore, the distinction between temporary suspensions and permanent policy changes proves critical for understanding Beijing's approach. The November 7, 2025 announcement suspended Announcements 55, 56, 57, 58, 61, and 62 until November 10, 2026, creating a precise one-year pause with automatic reinstatement provisions. This structure maintains regulatory pressure while providing diplomatic flexibility.

Critical Materials Under Regulatory Oversight

China's export control framework targets both raw materials and processing equipment across the rare earth supply chain. Heavy rare earth elements including dysprosium and terbium face licensing requirements due to their irreplaceable role in high-temperature magnetic applications. These materials enable electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators to maintain performance under thermal stress conditions.

Light rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium also require export licenses, affecting the foundation of permanent magnet production globally. Consequently, the regulatory scope extends beyond raw materials to include processing equipment, creating vertical control across multiple supply chain stages. This comprehensive approach prevents circumvention through alternative processing routes.

Downstream products affected by the controls include finished magnets, catalysts, and technology components incorporating rare earth materials. The licensing requirements create compounding restrictions as materials progress through manufacturing stages, amplifying supply chain complexity for international manufacturers.

How China's 2025 Export Controls Actually Unfolded

Timeline of Regulatory Tightening and Market Response

The implementation of China's rare earth export controls during 2025 followed a calculated escalation pattern, creating maximum market disruption while maintaining policy flexibility. Each phase introduced new restrictions while building upon existing regulatory infrastructure alongside emerging critical minerals strategy initiatives.

April 2025: The Initial Shock Wave

Seven rare earth elements were placed under licensing requirements in April 2025, triggering immediate supply chain disruptions across critical technology sectors. Chinese magnet exports experienced a 50% decline within the first month as exporters struggled to navigate new permit requirements according to Reuters reporting.

The automotive sector faced particularly acute pressure, with portions of the global auto industry approaching shutdown conditions by May 2025 due to magnet shortages. This three-to-four week lag between regulatory implementation and critical supply failure demonstrated the fragility of just-in-time manufacturing systems dependent on Chinese rare earth materials.

Additionally, export license application backlogs developed rapidly, with over 2,000 applications from European Union companies alone by November 2025. The approval process proved complex and time-consuming, requiring multi-hundred page documentation packages and end-use justifications submitted to multiple Chinese government agencies simultaneously.

Market reactions were swift and substantial. Praseodymium-neodymium oxide prices surged approximately 40% year-to-date through November 2025, with an additional 14% weekly spike occurring during peak supply uncertainty. These price movements demonstrated the direct correlation between regulatory announcements and rare earth commodity valuations.

October 2025: Extraterritorial Expansion

China expanded its export control scope in October 2025, adding five additional rare earth elements to the controlled substances list. More significantly, Beijing introduced a foreign direct product rule for rare earth materials, establishing a 50% ownership threshold for export license determinations.

This extraterritorial provision extended compliance requirements beyond Chinese borders to international companies with partial Chinese ownership or significant supply chain involvement. However, the 50% threshold created immediate complications for joint ventures and companies with Chinese investment partners, forcing restructuring of ownership arrangements to maintain material access.

The October measures also targeted rare earth processing equipment separately from raw materials, suggesting a deliberate strategy to control both primary production inputs and intermediate processing capabilities. This vertical approach created multiple control points across the supply chain rather than focusing solely on finished goods.

November 2025: The Misunderstood ""Rollback""

The November 7, 2025 MOFCOM announcement created significant confusion in Western media and markets, with many characterising the move as a policy rollback rather than a temporary suspension. The official statement suspended specific announcements until November 10, 2026, creating a precise one-year window with automatic reinstatement provisions.

Crucially, the core licensing infrastructure remained fully operational despite the suspension of select October announcements. Export license applications continued requiring extensive documentation and multi-agency approval processes, maintaining bureaucratic friction regardless of suspended announcement numbers.

Western media mischaracterisation of the announcement as effectively ending rare earth controls glossed over the technical distinction between suspending specific measures and eliminating the licensing requirement framework entirely. The White House description of the moves proved overly optimistic compared to the actual policy language and implementation reality according to analysis by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

Bureaucratic delays persisted despite suspension headlines, with approval rates varying significantly based on end-use applications. Defense-related applications continued experiencing rejection rates approaching 80%, while commercial applications achieved approximately 50% approval rates through November 2025.

China's Strategic Dominance in Rare Earth Markets

Market Control Statistics and Geopolitical Leverage

China's position in global rare earth markets extends far beyond simple production statistics, creating a comprehensive dominance structure that spans extraction, processing, and manufacturing capabilities. This vertical integration provides Beijing with multiple leverage points across critical technology supply chains.

Production and Processing Monopoly

China controls approximately 60% of global rare earth extraction operations, but this figure understates the true extent of strategic dominance. More critically, China processes 85-90% of refined rare earth oxides globally, creating an essential chokepoint regardless of where initial mining occurs.

The processing monopoly proves particularly significant because rare earth ores require complex chemical separation and purification procedures before use in technology applications. Alternative mining operations outside China often depend on Chinese processing facilities to create usable materials, maintaining Beijing's leverage even over non-Chinese mineral sources.

Magnet manufacturing represents China's most concentrated advantage, with approximately 90% of high-performance permanent magnets produced within Chinese facilities. This downstream integration ensures that even if alternative rare earth sources develop, the critical manufacturing capacity remains under Chinese control.

Economic Impact Across Critical Industries

The scope of China's rare earth influence extends across multiple technology sectors with varying dependency levels and supply risk profiles:

Sector Dependency Level Key Applications Supply Risk Electric Vehicles Critical Motor magnets, batteries High Wind Energy Essential Generator magnets High Defense Systems Strategic Guidance systems, electronics Critical Consumer Electronics Moderate Speakers, hard drives Medium

Electric vehicle manufacturers face critical dependency on Chinese rare earth supplies for motor magnet production, with no viable short-term alternatives for high-performance applications. Wind energy sector dependency proves essential for generator efficiency, while defence systems require strategic materials for guidance and electronic systems.

Chokepoint Analysis for Global Supply Chains

Single points of failure characterise the rare earth supply chain, with Chinese processing capacity representing the most significant vulnerability. Lead times have extended from typical weeks to months as licensing requirements create additional delays and uncertainty.

Price volatility demonstrates direct correlation with Chinese regulatory announcements, as evidenced by the 40% year-to-date increase in praseodymium-neodymium oxide prices through November 2025. This price sensitivity reflects the lack of alternative suppliers capable of meeting global demand at scale.

Alternative supplier capacity gaps remain substantial, with non-Chinese sources unable to replace Chinese production volumes within reasonable timeframes. Timeline projections for meaningful supply chain diversification extend 5-10 years minimum for most critical applications, maintaining Chinese leverage throughout the transition period.

Heavy Rare Earth Elements: Maximum Vulnerability

Strategic Importance of Dysprosium and Terbium

Heavy rare earth elements occupy a unique position in the critical materials landscape due to their irreplaceable performance characteristics and extreme geographic concentration. Unlike light rare earth elements where some substitution pathways exist, dysprosium and terbium provide essential properties for high-temperature applications with no current alternatives.

High-Temperature Performance Requirements

Motor efficiency in electric vehicles depends on dysprosium addition to prevent thermal demagnetisation above specific temperature thresholds. High-performance and military vehicle applications require mission-critical reliability across wide temperature ranges, making dysprosium essential for maintaining magnetic properties under extreme thermal stress.

Wind turbine generator reliability in harsh environments demands terbium addition to maintain magnetic stability during thermal cycling conditions created by intermittent power generation and mechanical stress. Modern permanent magnet generators cannot achieve required efficiency and durability specifications without heavy rare earth enhancement.

Military applications requiring temperature stability in guidance systems and electronics represent strategic end-uses where performance degradation poses mission-critical risks. These defence applications experience rejection rates approaching 80% for Chinese export license applications, demonstrating Beijing's strategic prioritisation of supply restrictions to military sectors.

Geographic Concentration Risks

Southern China clay deposits serve as the primary global source for heavy rare earth elements, creating extreme geographic concentration risk. These deposits, located primarily in ionic clay formations, contain the highest concentrations of dysprosium and terbium accessible through current extraction technologies.

Myanmar border region instability affects supply routes and alternative sourcing options, compounding the geographic concentration problem. Political tensions and infrastructure limitations in border areas create additional supply chain vulnerabilities beyond Chinese regulatory controls.

Furthermore, limited viable alternative deposits outside Chinese territorial control constrain diversification efforts. While heavy rare earth elements exist in other global locations, the concentrations and extraction economics prove significantly less favourable than Chinese sources, limiting practical substitution potential.

Processing technology barriers prevent non-Chinese producers from achieving equivalent separation and purification capabilities. The complex chemistry required for heavy rare earth processing remains concentrated within Chinese facilities, creating additional dependency beyond raw material extraction.

Engineering teams across multiple industries have accelerated development of heavy rare earth-free solutions in response to supply chain uncertainties. These innovations focus on achieving equivalent performance through design modifications and alternative material compositions rather than depending on scarce dysprosium and terbium supplies.

Engineering Solutions and Supply Chain Diversification

N45SH and N48SH magnet grades have achieved high performance benchmarks entirely without dysprosium addition, representing significant technological progress in HREE-free manufacturing. The N48SH grade reportedly under development promises even higher performance specifications while maintaining independence from heavy rare earth supplies.

Laminated magnet designs reduce heat-related demagnetisation through improved thermal management, lessening dependency on dysprosium's high-temperature properties. These segmented architectures distribute thermal stress more effectively, enabling HREE-free magnets to achieve performance levels previously requiring heavy rare earth enhancement.

Grain boundary diffusion techniques enhance coercivity in light rare earth magnets, providing alternative pathways to high-temperature performance. Advanced processing methods enable optimisation of magnetic properties without requiring scarce heavy rare earth additions.

In addition, cerium-based alloy research explores lighter rare earth substitutes for traditional heavy rare earth applications. These investigations focus on abundant light rare earth elements that could replace dysprosium and terbium in specific applications while maintaining required performance characteristics.

Design Engineering Workarounds

Innovation Spotlight: Automotive engineers are implementing segmented magnet architectures and advanced cooling systems to maintain motor performance while reducing dependency on temperature-resistant heavy rare earths.

Motor design modifications include larger magnet volumes and improved cooling systems to achieve equivalent performance without heavy rare earth enhancement. These engineering approaches trade material scarcity for design complexity, enabling continued production despite supply constraints.

Laminated stacks and advanced motor controls provide additional pathways for maintaining efficiency while reducing rare earth dependency. These system-level solutions optimise overall performance through intelligent design rather than relying solely on material properties.

Alternative Supply Chain Development

Government investment in domestic rare earth capacity has accelerated significantly during 2025, with the US Department of Defense allocating $400 million toward domestic production capabilities. This represents substantial federal commitment to supply chain resilience alongside the executive order on minerals initiatives, though capacity development timelines extend multiple years.

Australian rare earth projects are ramping production capacity to provide alternatives to Chinese sources, though processing capabilities remain limited. Projects including Lynas Corporation and emerging producers aim to establish integrated supply chains independent of Chinese processing infrastructure.

Canadian processing facilities target 2026-2027 operational dates, representing potential diversification opportunities for North American manufacturers. These developments focus on establishing domestic processing capabilities rather than depending on Chinese separation and purification facilities.

European Union critical materials stockpiling initiatives aim to create strategic reserves for supply disruption scenarios. These government-led programmes prioritise building buffer inventories of essential materials while longer-term diversification efforts develop capacity.

Export License Requirements: Practical Business Impact

Compliance Challenges and Market Friction

The licensing requirement framework creates substantial operational complexity for global manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earth supplies. Application processes involve extensive documentation, multi-agency coordination, and unpredictable approval timelines that fundamentally alter supply chain planning approaches.

Application Process Complexity

Multi-hundred page documentation requirements characterise export license applications, demanding detailed technical specifications, end-use justifications, and supply chain transparency. Companies must provide comprehensive product descriptions, importing entity verification, and strategic use attestations across multiple Chinese government agencies simultaneously.

Processing timeframes extend 3-6 months minimum for standard applications, with defence-related applications experiencing significantly longer delays or outright rejections. The approval process involves coordination between MOFCOM, customs authorities, and security agencies, creating multiple points where applications may encounter delays or denials.

End-use justification requirements force companies to provide detailed explanations of intended applications, creating transparency demands that may compromise competitive information. Manufacturers must balance regulatory compliance with protection of proprietary product development information.

Rejection rates for defence-related applications approach 80%, creating effective embargoes on Chinese rare earth supplies for military applications. This selective approval process enables China to maintain commercial relationships while restricting strategic end-uses.

Operational Impact on Global Manufacturers

Just-in-time inventory models have become obsolete for manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earth supplies, forcing fundamental changes to working capital and storage requirements. Companies have shifted toward maintaining substantial buffer inventories to accommodate licensing delays and approval uncertainties.

Safety stock requirements have increased 300-500% compared to pre-control inventory levels, representing substantial working capital impacts for affected manufacturers. This inventory expansion reflects the need to maintain production continuity despite unpredictable supply chain disruptions.

Supplier qualification processes now extend beyond technical specifications to include regulatory compliance capabilities and licensing track records. Manufacturers must evaluate suppliers based on their ability to navigate Chinese export control requirements successfully rather than focusing solely on cost and quality metrics.

Contract terms increasingly incorporate regulatory change clauses to address the possibility of sudden policy modifications. These provisions attempt to allocate risk between parties for scenarios involving unexpected export control modifications or licensing delays.

Financial Implications for Supply Chain Planning

Price premiums for non-Chinese rare earth sources range 15-25% above Chinese rates, reflecting scarcity value and alternative supplier capacity constraints. These premiums represent structural cost increases that affect manufacturing economics across rare earth-dependent industries.

Working capital increases result from extended lead times and higher inventory requirements, creating financing pressures for manufacturers adapting to new supply chain realities. Companies must secure additional financing to accommodate longer cash conversion cycles and higher safety stock levels.

However, currency hedging complexity increases with multi-jurisdiction sourcing strategies designed to reduce Chinese dependency. Manufacturers must manage foreign exchange exposure across multiple currencies and longer time horizons than traditional supply arrangements required.

Insurance costs for supply chain disruption coverage have risen substantially as insurers recognise the systemic risks created by rare earth export controls. Premium increases reflect the concentrated nature of rare earth supply chains and the potential for sudden regulatory changes.

Diversification Progress and Remaining Vulnerabilities

Production Capacity Development Outside China

Global efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earth supplies have accelerated significantly, though capacity development timelines extend multiple years and involve substantial capital requirements. Current progress demonstrates both promise and limitations in achieving supply chain independence, particularly given the broader defense materials strategy considerations.

Progress Assessment and Remaining Vulnerabilities

Region Current Capacity 2027 Projections Key Projects Australia 15% of global 25% of global Lynas, Iluka Resources North America 5% of global 12% of global MP Materials, Ucore Europe 2% of global 8% of global REE processing partnerships

Australian production capacity represents the most advanced alternative to Chinese sources, with Lynas Corporation operating integrated mining and processing facilities. However, downstream processing for speciality applications remains limited compared to Chinese capabilities, constraining substitution potential for high-performance applications.

North American capacity development focuses on domestic supply chain security, with MP Materials expanding production at Mountain Pass and other companies developing processing capabilities. Government support through defence department contracts provides revenue certainty for capacity investment decisions.

European initiatives emphasise processing partnerships and strategic material stockpiling rather than domestic mining operations. The European Union's critical materials strategy prioritises reducing processing dependence through technology partnerships and supply chain diversification agreements.

Technology Transfer and Processing Capabilities

Separation technology licensing agreements with Chinese firms create potential vulnerabilities in diversification strategies, as technology access depends on maintaining positive relationships with Chinese partners. These arrangements may face restrictions during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.

Independent processing development timelines require 5-7 years minimum to achieve commercial-scale operations, reflecting the technical complexity of rare earth separation and purification processes. Environmental permitting challenges in Western jurisdictions add additional time and uncertainty to project development schedules.

Capital requirements exceeding $1 billion characterise integrated rare earth processing facilities capable of competing with Chinese operations. These substantial investment thresholds limit the number of viable projects and extend development timelines as companies secure financing.

Environmental compliance costs in developed countries create structural disadvantages compared to Chinese operations, affecting long-term competitiveness of alternative suppliers. Regulatory requirements for waste management and environmental protection add operational costs that must be recovered through higher prices.

Market Reality Check on Supply Security

Non-Chinese capacity remains insufficient for complete substitution through 2030, maintaining structural dependence on Chinese supplies for most applications. Even aggressive capacity development scenarios leave significant supply gaps that require continued Chinese sourcing for global demand fulfilment.

Quality specifications for premium applications often require Chinese processing capabilities, limiting substitution potential even when alternative raw materials become available. The precision and consistency achieved by Chinese processing facilities proves difficult to replicate in new operations.

Cost competitiveness gaps persist despite geopolitical risk premiums, as Chinese operations benefit from scale economies and integrated supply chains. Alternative suppliers must achieve substantial scale before achieving cost parity with Chinese producers, extending the timeline for meaningful competition.

Strategic stockpile adequacy provides only 3-6 months maximum buffer for most countries, insufficient to weather extended supply disruptions or allow time for alternative capacity development. Government reserves focus on emergency preparedness rather than long-term supply independence.

Strategic Planning for Regulatory Uncertainty

Investment Implications and Long-term Outlook

The rare earth export control environment has fundamentally altered investment and strategic planning assumptions across technology sectors. Regulatory volatility represents the new baseline condition rather than temporary disruption, requiring adaptive strategies that accommodate ongoing uncertainty, particularly given recent developments in US minerals deal negotiations.

Policy Volatility as the New Normal

Export control frameworks enable rapid implementation of new restrictions without extended notification periods, creating permanent uncertainty for supply chain planning. The November 2025 suspension demonstrates how quickly policy conditions can change while maintaining underlying control infrastructure.

Suspension agreements remain subject to geopolitical relationship changes, with automatic reinstatement provisions ensuring that controls can resume without new regulatory processes. This structure maintains compliance pressure even during periods of apparent policy relaxation.

License approval rates correlate directly with diplomatic tensions between China and importing countries, creating additional unpredictability beyond technical application requirements. Companies must monitor geopolitical relationships as carefully as supply chain logistics when planning rare earth sourcing strategies.

Regulatory arbitrage opportunities continue diminishing over time as China expands control scope and international coordination increases. The extraterritorial provisions introduced in October 2025 demonstrate Beijing's willingness to extend controls beyond direct bilateral relationships.

Investment Implications for Critical Materials Sector

Rare earth mining equities have experienced 40-60% volatility ranges during 2025, reflecting investor uncertainty regarding supply chain developments and regulatory changes. Price movements correlate strongly with policy announcements rather than fundamental supply and demand factors.

Processing technology companies command premium valuations as investors recognise the strategic value of separation and purification capabilities. Companies with proven rare earth processing expertise benefit from scarcity value as alternatives to Chinese facilities gain importance.

Recycling and urban mining ventures attract strategic investment as manufacturers seek to reduce dependence on primary rare earth sources. These circular economy approaches offer potential supply chain independence while addressing environmental sustainability concerns.

Defence contractors prioritise supply chain resilience over cost optimisation, creating premium markets for non-Chinese rare earth sources. Government procurement preferences for domestic or allied suppliers support higher pricing for secure supply arrangements.

Long-term Strategic Considerations

Market Reality: While engineering innovations and alternative suppliers are developing rapidly, complete independence from Chinese rare earth supply chains remains 5-10 years away for most critical applications, making adaptive strategies more valuable than absolute solutions.

Technology evolution may reduce rare earth dependency over the long term through materials science advances and design optimisation. However, current applications in electric vehicles, wind energy, and defence systems continue requiring rare earth materials with no immediate substitutes available.

Geopolitical relationships will significantly influence the pace and direction of supply chain diversification efforts. Improved diplomatic relationships could reduce incentives for alternative supplier development, while continued tensions would accelerate diversification investments.

Economic competitiveness of alternative sources depends on achieving sufficient scale to compete with Chinese cost structures. Success requires sustained investment and market support during extended development periods when alternative suppliers operate at cost disadvantages.

Strategic stockpiling provides short-term supply security but cannot replace the need for sustainable long-term supply chain development. Government reserves serve emergency preparedness functions while industry develops alternative capacity and supply arrangements.

Navigating the Future of Rare Earth Markets

China's rare earth export controls have fundamentally transformed global supply chain assumptions and strategic planning requirements across critical technology sectors. The November 2025 suspension of select export control announcements demonstrates regulatory flexibility while maintaining structural control over essential materials according to analysis by the International Energy Agency.

The distinction between temporary policy adjustments and permanent strategic reversals proves critical for business planning and investment decisions. Beijing's approach maintains comprehensive leverage through processing capacity dominance and vertical supply chain integration regardless of specific regulatory announcements.

Industry adaptation through engineering innovation and alternative supplier development represents the most promising pathway toward supply chain resilience. HREE-free magnet technologies and diversified processing capacity reduce dependency on Chinese supplies while maintaining performance requirements.

However, complete independence from Chinese rare earth supply chains remains 5-10 years away for most critical applications, requiring adaptive strategies that accommodate ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Success depends on balancing immediate supply needs with long-term diversification investments while managing the financial and operational impacts of extended transition timelines.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and 710 will be temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announced layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://www.tristatehomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/92/2025/11/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330-e1762374307401.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-08 11:06:05.797898

While Tesla sales crater, BYD’s European registrations surged 272% year-over-year in recent months.
The targets tied to the compensation package include delivering 1 million Optimus robots and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation.
“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” Dan Ives, a managing director at financial firm Wedbush, told The Guardian.
EVXL’s Take This compensation vote represents one of the most striking examples of investor psychology trumping business fundamentals in recent corporate history.","Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented $1 trillion compensation package, potentially making him the world’s first trillionaire—despite collapsing European sales, mounting brand damage from political controversies, and serious questions about whether the world’s largest executive pay package will solve any of Tesla’s actual business problems.

The vote passed with more than 75% approval at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, according to NBC News. The timing couldn’t be more striking: shareholders approved the package on the same day Tesla’s October European sales data revealed catastrophic declines across nearly every major market, with registrations plummeting by double digits in key countries including Germany, Sweden, and Denmark.

Largest Corporate Compensation Package In History

The approved package would grant Musk up to 423.7 million additional Tesla shares over the next decade if he achieves extraordinarily ambitious targets, according to CNBC. Those milestones include growing Tesla’s market capitalization from approximately $1.4 trillion today to $8.5 trillion, expanding annual adjusted profit from current levels to $400 billion, delivering 20 million vehicles cumulatively, deploying 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and producing 1 million Optimus humanoid robots and 1 million robotaxis.

Musk currently owns roughly 12.5% of Tesla worth approximately $461 billion, making him the world’s wealthiest person with a net worth of about $473 billion according to Bloomberg. If he unlocks the full compensation package, his stake would increase to approximately 27% of the company.

“I super appreciate it. Thank you, everyone,” Musk said after the vote was announced, according to NBC News. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter on the future of Tesla but a whole new book.”

After the announcement, Musk celebrated on stage at the shareholder meeting, dancing and laughing alongside a pair of Optimus robots.

The Vote Nobody Expected To Be Close

The compensation package was expected to pass, with betting markets giving it 93% odds of approval on Wednesday, according to NBC News. Tesla introduced the pay plan in September 2025, with Board Chair Robyn Denholm warning shareholders in late October that rejecting it could trigger Musk’s departure and send the company’s value into freefall.

Major proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both recommended shareholders vote against the package, citing concerns about the total size of the award, shareholder dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Tesla’s sixth-largest external investor, also voted against the plan.

“While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk—consistent with our views on executive compensation,” Norges Bank Investment Management said in a statement reported by Fox Business.

Glass Lewis estimated that the entire S&P 500 combined paid all its CEOs about $9 billion last year, according to NPR. Using even conservative valuations, Musk’s package works out to roughly $88 billion over ten years, or $8.8 billion annually—nearly as much as every other major corporate CEO combined, before factoring in potential stock growth.

The Timing: European Sales Collapse On Vote Day

The shareholder vote occurred on the same day EVXL reported that Tesla’s October 2025 sales had collapsed across Europe. New vehicle registrations plummeted by double-digit margins in nearly every major market, with Sweden down 89%, Denmark down 86%, and Germany down 54% compared to the previous year.

The European sales crisis stems from three interconnected problems: stale product lineup, brand damage from Musk’s political activities, and fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD. While Tesla sales crater, BYD’s European registrations surged 272% year-over-year in recent months.

In the United States, Tesla faces a different but equally serious challenge. The September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit—eliminated through President Trump’s legislative package—has sent the broader EV market into freefall. U.S. motor vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units in October, with electric vehicle sales dropping 24% in just one month.

Tesla managed to avoid the immediate impact by reporting record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 vehicles—crushing Wall Street estimates of 447,000—as buyers rushed to purchase before the tax credit expired, according to Yahoo Finance. But that artificial spike pulled demand forward from future quarters, setting up what analysts warn will be a challenging fourth quarter and beyond.

The Robot Army And Control Concerns

Musk has repeatedly stated that the compensation package is less about money and more about maintaining control over Tesla and its future products, particularly the Optimus humanoid robot program.

“If I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? That’s my biggest concern,” Musk said in an October webcast with Wall Street analysts reported by NBC News. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm echoed this sentiment in recent interviews. “It’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence,” she told CNBC.

The targets tied to the compensation package include delivering 1 million Optimus robots and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. Neither product is anywhere near commercial reality—Tesla’s robotaxi service launched in Austin with just 10-20 vehicles that still require safety drivers, and the Optimus robot remains in prototype stage with basic functionality challenges.

Why Investors Stuck With Musk Despite Everything

The shareholder vote represents a remarkable show of confidence in Musk despite significant brand damage throughout 2025. Tesla’s association with political controversies—including Musk’s work in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency and his support for far-right political groups in Europe—has alienated left-leaning consumers who historically formed the core EV buyer demographic.

French Tesla owners filed a lawsuit in June 2025 citing Musk’s political stances as damaging their peaceful use of their vehicles, with some owners reporting vandalism including swastikas painted on their cars. France saw Tesla sales drop 67% year-over-year in May 2024 following Musk’s political activities.

Yet Tesla’s stock has surged approximately two-thirds since May 2025, when Musk announced he was leaving the Trump administration, according to The Guardian. The stock rally reflects investor optimism about Tesla’s artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions, with analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities estimating Tesla’s AI-driven self-driving portfolio could be worth nearly $1 trillion alone.

“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” Dan Ives, a managing director at financial firm Wedbush, told The Guardian. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”

Another factor is the culture among U.S. investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged, and Jeff Bezos enjoyed a long reign at Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Most Tesla shareholders seemed more concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company rather than wanting him to leave altogether.

“Money talks in the US more,” Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets, told The Guardian. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”

The Disconnect Between Compensation And Business Reality

Critics argue the compensation vote reveals a fundamental disconnect between shareholder sentiment and Tesla’s actual business performance. The company faces declining deliveries, shrinking market share, and profit pressures largely attributed to Musk’s behavior driving customers away.

“He has hundreds of billions of dollars already in the company, and to say that he won’t stay without a trillion is ridiculous,” Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at research firm Telemetry who has covered Tesla for nearly two decades, told Euronews. “It’s absurd that shareholders think he is worth this much.”

Shareholder advocate James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, opposed the plan due to concerns about demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits.

“Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,” McRitchie told CNBC. “There’s a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.”

The compensation package requires Tesla to increase its market cap nearly sixfold to $8.5 trillion—larger than Apple and Microsoft combined—while delivering more than double the number of vehicles it has sold since the company’s founding. Achieving those targets while Chinese manufacturers like BYD aggressively expand globally and traditional automakers scale back EV investments presents extraordinary challenges.

EVXL’s Take

This compensation vote represents one of the most striking examples of investor psychology trumping business fundamentals in recent corporate history. Shareholders just approved paying Musk nearly a trillion dollars based on hitting science-fiction targets—1 million robots, 1 million robotaxis, an $8.5 trillion valuation—while the core automotive business that generates virtually all of Tesla’s revenue is hemorrhaging customers in Europe and facing a post-tax-credit demand cliff in America.

We’ve been tracking this story closely. Back in late October, Board Chair Robyn Denholm issued an urgent warning that Tesla could collapse into “just another car company” without this compensation package. But here’s the fundamental problem with that framing: if only Musk can save Tesla, why is Tesla dying under his leadership?

European sales data published the very day of the shareholder vote showed catastrophic declines—Sweden down 89%, Denmark down 86%, Germany down 54%. These aren’t just bad numbers; they represent a structural collapse driven by three factors that paying Musk more won’t fix: stale products, brand damage from his political activities, and brutal competition from Chinese manufacturers offering better technology at lower prices.

The compensation targets assume Tesla can grow from $1.4 trillion to $8.5 trillion in market cap—larger than Apple and Microsoft combined—while simultaneously delivering 20 million vehicles. For context, Tesla has delivered roughly 8 million vehicles total since its founding. The plan requires more than doubling that in just ten years while losing market share in Europe and navigating a U.S. market where federal EV tax credits expired September 30.

We predicted this would happen. When federal EV tax credits ended, we warned of demand collapse. It arrived right on schedule—U.S. vehicle sales cratered in October with EV sales plunging 24% in a single month. Tesla’s Q3 record deliveries were artificially inflated by customers rushing to beat the September 30 deadline, pulling forward demand that would have occurred in Q4 and beyond.

The robotaxi and Optimus robot targets sound ambitious, but they’re nowhere near commercial reality. Tesla’s Austin robotaxi pilot operates with 10-20 vehicles that still require safety drivers. The Optimus robot remains a prototype with basic functionality challenges. These aren’t realistic near-term business lines—they’re speculative moonshots that shareholders just agreed to pay for in advance with the largest compensation package in corporate history.

What Tesla actually needs isn’t a bigger carrot for Musk—it’s a fundamental strategic refocus on the automotive business. That means accelerating affordable model launches, meaningfully refreshing the Model 3 and Model Y with competitive technology, pricing aggressively to compete with Chinese manufacturers, and rebuilding brand reputation in Europe through both product excellence and, frankly, keeping the CEO out of divisive political controversies that alienate core customers.

The vote passed with 75% approval, but remember the context: Norway’s $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund voted against it. Glass Lewis and ISS—the two largest proxy advisory firms—recommended rejection. The opposition came from sophisticated institutional investors focused on fundamentals, while approval came largely from retail shareholders betting on Musk’s vision regardless of current business reality.

This story connects directly to our extensive coverage of Musk’s political distractions, Tesla’s retreat from Delaware to Texas to avoid shareholder accountability, and the broader industry collapse following tax credit expiration that’s now claiming thousands of jobs at GM, Rivian, and across the supply chain.

The compensation package essentially asks: should we reward spectacular failure and brand damage with nearly a trillion dollars based on achieving targets that require Tesla to become larger than Apple and Microsoft combined? Shareholders answered yes. Whether that bet pays off or becomes the most expensive corporate mistake in history remains to be seen.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","(The Hill) – In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and 710 will be temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announced layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://www.abc27.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/11/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330-e1762374307401.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-08 12:05:38.063127

They have done huge investment in the whole battery supply chain over decades and giving know-how to other countries like India can shift the market dynamics soon.
Given that these are not export prohibitions but license mandates, why should the move be a cause of concern for the global battery companies?","China has announced new export controls that will take effect on November 8, 2025. Among controlled items are lithium-ion battery cells and battery packs with a gravimetric energy density exceeding 300 Wh/kg, various cathode materials and their precursors, artificial graphite anode materials and related production equipment and technology. This puts the focus on a few companies, like Epsilon Advanced Materials, working to build capacity to deliver battery-grade CAM and anode materials ex-China. Mr Vikram Handa, Managing Director of Epsilon Advanced Materials, shared his views on this development.

Could you please share a brief note on Epsilon Advanced Materials’ current CAM and anode manufacturing capabilities, status, and locations in India and globally?

We commissioned India’s first graphite anode qualification & commercial plant in Bellary, Karnataka, in early 2024. The scale-up facility will produce 30,000 tons by 2027 with 100,000 tons by 2030. We have also received all pre-construction permits for our North Carolina, USA facility with 60,000 tons of graphite anode by 2030.

Our Cathode Technology Centre in Germany is an advanced R&D facility with a 250-ton commercial demonstration plant, the largest LFP cathode facility outside China. This centre holds over 120 patents, and we are developing next-generation cathode materials with advanced cell testing work. In India, we plan to commission the country’s first LFP Cathode Active Material (CAM) manufacturing plant by 2028 with an initial capacity of 30,000 tons, scaling up to 100,000 tons by 2031.

All these plans are to support our mission for the global battery supply chain and contribute to sustainable energy solutions. Both of our anode & cathode material is qualified with cell makers & auto OEMs in India, the US and the EU and we should close on an offtake soon to enable a secure & reliable supply chain outside China.

Many reports say that China controls 99% of the graphite anode market and over 80% of cathode material manufacturing at present. Is that a correct assessment of China’s current control on the battery value chain?

Yes, that’s correct. China has done commendable work in the last 20~25 years in mining, battery material processing & battery manufacturing, hence their dominant position is obvious. We need to learn a lot from China on how the government incentivised everyone to integrate both upstream & downstream so as to create a resilient ecosystem that allowed everyone to thrive not only in the domestic market but has also been enjoying a highly skewed global leadership position.

Their recent export restrictions on battery materials, machinery and its technology is an indicator and explains why business and government needs to build ex-China capacity and supply chain through focused policies. Because a policy, incentive, or subsidy made for cell makers might not work for battery material producers like us. Many companies are now building their capabilities; however, we need binding offtakes & agreements from downstream industry which can make these innovations & investments feasible and practical.

How do you see China’s latest export control announcement involving advanced batteries, production equipment, cathode materials, and artificial graphite anode materials, along with related production equipment and technology?

After the rare earth metal ban, this kind of ban was seen coming. China’s export sanctions safeguard their interest to not let their innovation & technology be sold outside and dilute their market dominance. They have done huge investment in the whole battery supply chain over decades and giving know-how to other countries like India can shift the market dynamics soon.

The restrictions raise concerns for cross-border transfers of high-end battery cells, key upstream inputs, and machines. Operationally, it will compel buyers and OEMs to reassess sourcing risk, accelerate localisation plans, and fast-track qualification of alternative suppliers outside China. In short, it’s a wake-up call that supply-chain resilience is now a front-line commercial priority.

Given that these are not export prohibitions but license mandates, why should the move be a cause of concern for the global battery companies?

License requirements may sound less severe than outright bans, but they materially increase commercial friction and execution risk. Licenses create additional lead times, uncertainty about approvals and the possibility of case-by-case denials or restrictive conditions. For high-volume manufacturing, even short lead-time disruptions can derail project timelines, qualification schedules and finance assumptions. I believe license regimes has unpredictable gating points into a supply chain that until now relied on relatively frictionless cross-border trade and that unpredictability can translate into higher costs, slower ramp-ups and high execution risk for Indian & global battery makers.

Export control also extends to production equipment for CAM and graphite anodes. How do these restrictions impact ex-China CAM and anode manufacturing companies like Epsilon?

For ex-China manufacturers, controls on equipment can raise two operational challenges. Certain downstream lines and high-precision machines sourced from China may now face licensing hurdles or supply delays, which may complicate procurement and commissioning schedules. Also, the transfer of associated technology and know-how may become slower or subject to approvals, which can lengthen qualification cycles.

That said, this also creates an opportunity to invest in non-Chinese equipment suppliers, incentivise partnerships with global OEMs of critical machinery, and increase the commercial value of products from companies like Epsilon that can deliver qualified, locally sourced CAM and anode materials. Practically, companies must diversify equipment suppliers, build strategic inventory buffers for long-lead items, and accelerate local engineering and process development to reduce dependence on any single geography.

What steps does Epsilon plan to take to secure equipment procurement for its facilities, as well as speed up the race to deliver production-ready battery materials on a mass scale?

Our steps are multi-pronged and pragmatic. We are qualifying alternate equipment vendors across India and Japan, so single-source risks are minimised. We are strengthening engineering and machine-integration capabilities locally and forming strategic JV/technology partnerships to internalize critical process steps. Parallel qualification tracks with cell manufacturers (pilot → pre-commercial → commercial) have now shortened via feedback loops, sample exchanges and testing. We are working closely with industry bodies and the government to ensure predictable trade and investment frameworks that support the rapid commercialisation of ex-China supply.

Any other information you would like to share on the subject?

Two closing points from my end. First, the lessons learnt from China’s restrictions must accelerate our energy security and supply-chain resilience for the whole battery value chain and not just procurement checkboxes. Governments, investors and industry must accelerate coordinated action to build local processing, incentivize equipment manufacturing, and expand recycling and secondary-materials ecosystems.

Second, the challenge is surmountable with focused capital, policy support and cross-border partnerships. We must create a diversified, reliable supply chain outside China within the next 3~5 years so that companies like us, who are committed to being part of that solution, can survive & thrive.",https://evreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Evreporter_china-export-curb.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 11:05:59.380143
,Congress,2025-11-08 14:02:00+00:00,The Nation,"At COP30, Will Lula Be a Rain Forest Champion? - The Nation","Jonathan Watts, Leah Abrams, Jeet Heer, Steve Brodner, Chris Lehmann, The Nation, Mychal Denzel Smith, www.thenation.com",,,,,https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/lula-brazil-amazon-cop30-climate/,"Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rain forest and its people.
Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50 percent over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office.
These gains were front and center as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at COP30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125 billion for the protection of standing forests.
Antonio Donato Nobre, an earth-system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown.
Ruralista politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation.","Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rain forest and its people.

But with a divided administration, a hostile Congress, and 20th-century developmentalist instincts, this global figurehead of the center left has a balancing act to perform in advocating protection of nature and a reduction of emissions.

At the opening of the summit on Thursday, he made clear that his priority was social development, but he was clear that humanity had to make an energy transition and halt the lost of forests: “I am convinced that, despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need road maps to—in a fair and planned way—reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels, and mobilize the resources necessary for these objectives.”

Those difficulties and contradictions have been starkly apparent in recent months, in which the government has announced impressive progress in reducing deforestation, while also pushing forward a number of projects that would open up the Amazon to extractivism.

First, the good news. Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50 percent over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office. The latest annual government figures show the smallest area of clearance in 11 years. This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging, and wildcat mining.

As a result, the Climate Observatory estimates that Brazil’s emissions—which are mainly determined by the health of its forests—have fallen by 16.7 percent, likely to be the steepest fall of any of the G20 group of the world’s 20 biggest economies.

These gains were front and center as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at COP30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125 billion for the protection of standing forests. So far, the initiative has raised about $5.5 billion, with investments of $3 billion from Norway, $1 billion each from Brazil and Indonesia, and smaller sums from Portugal, the Netherlands, and other countries.

The money is desperately needed to stave off the rapidly growing danger that the world’s biggest tropical forest will decline beyond a point of no return, after which it will be condemned to desiccate into a savannah and lose much of its globally important functions of climate stabilization, water transport, and habitat provision.

Senior scientists have warned that this is already happening in wide areas of the Amazon, particularly in the states of Matto Grosso, which has seen a rapid expansion of soy plantations, and Pará, where the primary cause of destruction in the beef industry. The weakening of the forest has also been accelerated by fire (widely used for land clearance) and the contamination of rivers with mercury (which is used in gold mining).

Antonio Donato Nobre, an earth-system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown. He said droughts are increasingly severe, temperatures in some cleared areas have increased by up to 7 C and degradation is accelerating even as deforestation slows. This poses a global threat, he said, not only because of a reduced carbon sequestration capacity, but because a weaker rain forest means less cloud cover to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, which is potentially a greater warming threat than greenhouse gases.

Ad Policy

Nobre said the first climate summit in the Amazon was an opportunity to put nature at the heart of climate solutions but could also be a disaster if leaders paid only lip service to the importance of the forest, while pushing ahead with destructive projects. “My main message is, get serious,” he said. “The most successful enterprise on the planet is called life. We have in our hands a technology that is 4 billion years old and has gone through multiple cycles of destruction and rebirth and refixing.”

But Lula relies on support from the agribusiness and mining sectors to maintain power. Ruralista politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation. This lobby is now the driving force in Brazilian politics.

While Lula has vetoed some of its most radical plans to eradicate swaths of environmental licensing requirements, he has also appeared more than willing to support other elements of its agenda to carve up the Amazon and other biomes for the production of fossil fuels and monoculture crops.

Three weeks ago, his government approved drilling licenses for oil and gas exploration at the Foz do Amazonas, off the coast of the rain forest, a move that adds to the contamination risks facing the forest, increases the likelihood of vegetation destruction by related industries and runs contrary to advice from the International Energy Agency that it will be impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global heating unless countries completely halt new fossil fuel development.

Then there are the government’s plans to upgrade the BR-319 highway between Manaus and Porto Velho, which will put unprecedented pressure on the western regions of the Brazilian Amazon, which have—until now—been one of the last healthy regions of the forest.

Another large intact area is close to the northwest border with Venezuela, but this too is menaced by plans to permit industrial mining in the Yanomami Indigenous territory.

“We’re very worried,” said one of those in the region, Ehuana Yaira Yanomami, who has come to Belém to relay the fears of the women of her community. “We don’t want our people to suffer, we are very worried and that’s why we are speaking out, because illegal mining only brings suffering to our communities. We want to see our children healthy, without mud and without the fish being contaminated.”

Farther south, the government announced in late August that it would “de-statize” the federal waterways of three major rivers; the Tapajós, Madeira, and Tocantins, which is seen as a first step toward their privatization and transformation into a hydrovia water transport route for soy shipped from Mato Grosso.

Lula, who cut his political teeth as a union negotiator, has tended to focus more on the social benefits that can come from increased investment in the Amazon, while skirting the far greater risks that the climate crisis poses to its human and nonhuman residents.

That was evident last week at a pre-COP30 publicity tour of forest communities along the Tapajos river. At the Vista Alegre do Capixauã village of the Kumaruara people, the president said he was ready to stand up for those who protect the forests, and promised to improve local healthcare, education and housing. This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.

But during the parts of his visit open to the press, Lula did not make a single mention of the climate, even though this is a growing concern for local people—and a huge majority of the world’s population.

The head of a neighboring village, Luis Antonio Bentes de Sousa, said that much of the river dried up during last year’s record drought, leaving the communities here stranded and struggling to feed themselves. He said his vegetable garden had shriveled up, most of his fruit trees died and for the first time in his 70-year-life he was unable to grow manioc, the primary staple of the Amazon diet.

“It is getting hotter and drier,” he said.” I worry for my children and grandchildren.”

Others spoke of mass fish deaths due to the heat, contamination, and low water levels, and expressed fears that this will become worse when the river they depend on is privatized and turned into a canal for soy barges.

These uncomfortable topics—and their politically difficult solutions—were not raised during the speeches and glad-handing of Lula’s visit until the very end, when Environment Minister Marina Silva asked for the microphone and reminded the president why they are in the Amazon this month: “COP30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation. And the world needs to do its part, reducing emissions of coal, oil, and gas. That is why I like it when, sir, you say it’s necessary to stop depending on fossil fuels.”

This was a reminder that in Belém, Lula—like many world leaders—will have a good forest angel on one shoulder and a fossil fuel demon on the other. The question is which will hold sway.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/lula-belem-cop30-getty.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 11:05:16.656945

As a renewable energy source, it is self-replenishing and produces no operational emissions, though the lifecycle of wind turbines presents its own environmental considerations.

The sector is experiencing substantial growth, yet it operates within a complex global energy landscape still wrestling with rising demand and emissions.

A record 117 GW of new wind capacity was added globally in 2023, bringing total cumulative capacity beyond 1,136 GW, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Despite this growth, overall energy-related CO₂ emissions rose by 0.8% in 2023 to a new high of 37.8Gt CO₂.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) points to increased coal consumption in China, India and Southeast Asia as a primary cause.

While advanced economies reduced their energy demand, the growth in clean energy could not fully offset the world’s escalating needs.

The IEA confirms that accelerating clean energy growth is essential to limit power-sector emissions this decade.

A major hurdle for wind energy is its integration into grids that have historically been built to accommodate fossil fuels. Establishing connections for wind farms is complex, especially for offshore projects that can often be located more than 100km from land.

These distances require long transition lines and development can be slowed by permitting bottlenecks and limited grid capacity.

Furthermore, the variable nature of wind means the energy supply is intermittent. This unpredictability requires other, more constant, energy sources to meet power demand.

To mitigate this, wind power is often combined with other renewables like solar to smooth out the overall energy production curve.

Innovative solutions and project developments

To address intermittency, companies are piloting integrated energy systems.

The Hollandse Kust Noord project in the Netherlands combines offshore wind with floating solar panels, battery storage and offshore hydrogen electrolysis.

The project began operations in December 2023.

Its floating solar array will be situated alongside the turbines to provide a more consistent energy output.

The inclusion of batteries and an on-site hydrogen plant allows for the storage of excess energy generated during periods of high wind and low demand.

Tackling the turbine lifecycle footprint

While wind turbines are clean during operation, their manufacturing, transport and decommissioning have an environmental footprint.

Turbine blades, made from composite materials like fibreglass and resin, are particularly difficult to recycle at their end-of-life.

The industry is actively seeking solutions to this challenge.

The Kaskasi offshore wind farm in Germany is the first commercial project to use Siemens Gamesa’s RecyclableBlade technology.

This innovation allows for the recovery of blade materials once a turbine is decommissioned.

Marc Becker, CEO of the Siemens Gamesa Offshore Business Unit, says: ""We are proving that as leaders of the offshore revolution, we are committed to making disruptive technology innovation commercially viable with the pace that the climate emergency demands.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/9f9cd6f9117943d66825bb9c951aebc6:9e13bdeead3751ade56d7cfa46d67657/jesse-de-meulenaere-iatiyqrtl8-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 09:18:47.651919

It is incredibly disappointing that we are on day thirty-eight of the Democrats’ reckless government shutdown, making it the longest in American history. Senate Democrats have officially voted fifteen times to keep the government closed. I voted weeks ago to fund the government, and have since advocated for reopening it and returning to normal order.

REMINDER: Financial Resources for Impacted Individuals

If you or someone you know has been impacted by the government shutdown, financial resources are available. Last month, I held a roundtable in San Angelo with local financial institutions and community organizations, where banks announced 0% interest loans and United Way announced they are providing gift cards, gas cards, energy assistance programs, clothing assistance programs, food assistance programs, and more for those in need. Additionally, the City of San Angelo announced plans to extend bill payments to anyone experiencing financial uncertainty due to the shutdown.

ICYMI: SNAP Resources for Texas-11

3.5 million vulnerable Texans are having their SNAP benefits threatened because Democrats refuse to reopen the government. Today, the Trump administration told states they are working to pay full November food stamp benefits during the government shutdown. While this will alleviate the immediate pain for many families across America, this is only a short-term fix.

Holding the Line on a Continuing Resolution

As Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest Congressional caucus with 189 Republican members, I joined my fellow RSC leaders to release a statement this week calling for an end to the Democrats’ shutdown through a continuing resolution that funds the government at least into January 2026.

The statement, first covered in Fox News, also urges Congress to reject extending Biden-era COVID subsidies while delivering a health care system for Americans that is truly accessible, affordable, and spurs innovation. Lower health care costs start with fostering competition in the market, and that is exactly what I am advocating for in Congress.

Mason Town Hall

I had a terrific community town hall in Mason this week. While the Democrats continue with their political theatrics and hold the government hostage, my top priority remains fighting for Texans and providing top-notch constituent services to the incredible men and women I am blessed to represent.

I’m extremely grateful to everyone who came out, and I was honored to recognize the outstanding work of the Mason Junior High Kind Club–a group of exceptional eighth-grade girls who serve as leaders for younger students by modeling acts of kindness and participating in community service projects–for their recent creative pumpkin painting project. This project raised funds for the Mason Cancer Benefit, demonstrating how they put their mission into action.

It’s clubs and students like this who are making real impacts in their communities, and it gives me hope to see young people giving up their time to serve and volunteer for the betterment of those around them.

Standing Up Against Christian Persecution in Nigeria

We must stand against the unjust persecution of Christians in Nigeria who are being brutally murdered simply for their faith. As a Christian myself, this is personal, and I will not stay silent while men, women, and children are targeted for what they believe. This senseless violence must end peacefully.

I joined my colleagues on the Values Action Team (VAT) to commend President Trump’s leadership on this issue and call for the end of Christian persecution in Nigeria. Read more here or by clicking on the image below.

Maria Bartiromo in the Permian Basin

Few places tell the story of American strength quite like the Permian Basin. I was proud to welcome Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business to the heart of West Texas to showcase the region that fuels our country every single day.

From a Diamondback Energy frac site to a Chevron oil rig, Maria saw firsthand the innovation and grit that makes the Permian Basin the largest, safest, and most secure source of oil and gas in the United States. Local energy leaders also delivered a clear message: President Biden’s four-year war on American energy hurt American workers, drove up energy costs, and put a target on the back of the Permian Basin.

During our exclusive interview, I highlighted how the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have fought tirelessly to rebuild a pro-energy framework in government by cutting red tape and putting American producers back in the driver’s seat. But the work is far from over. Permitting reform remains a top priority, and as the representative of America’s energy capital, I plan to lead that charge in Congress once the Democrats quit their political theatrics and open the government.

The visit showcased what Texans already know: the Permian Basin is the crown jewel of American energy, powered by the hardworking men and women who keep our energy, economy, and country secure. Watch our exclusive interview that aired on Fox Business here or by clicking the image below.

Like a fish out of water trying to flop its way back to safety, US President Donald Trump has been floundering from one self-made disaster to another. Perhaps a return to his native environment of glitz and ballrooms will soothe his troubled mind. In the meantime, he is faced with the disturbing reality of failure, with the nation’s EV charging station network as Exhibit A.

More EV Charging Stations For The US

To be clear, Trump has achieved some notable, if temporary, successes. For example, thousands of working households lost their jobs after the president almost snuffed out the entire domestic offshore wind industry. And, EV sales fell off a cliff in October after Trump’s Republican allies in Congress passed a new tax bill that eliminated the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as of September 30.

Still, the wind will continue blowing long after Trump leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes. The case for vehicle electrification is also not going anywhere anytime soon. While US automakers are retrenching their EV manufacturing plans for the time being, signs of recovery are also evident in the rapid uptick of EV charging station activity this year.

One newly emerging factor consists of new financial models that make installing new EV charging stations a hassle-free experience for tenant-occupied commercial and residential properties. The overwhelming majority of EV owners prefer the convenience of charging where they live, and now that option is being opened up to millions more prospective EV buyers.

Another factor is the rising competition among quick-serve restaurants, travel centers, and convenience stores seeking to attract EV drivers. The space of EV charging is tailor-made for drivers to stop in for a bite to eat or buy a pack of beef jerky, a keychain with their name on it, or any number of other items.

US States Step Up As US Government Steps Down

State-based EV charging incentives are also continuing to lay the groundwork for an EV sales revival, with Illinois being the most recent one to join the fray. On November 6, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency launched a new $20 million program to install Level 3 and Level 2 public charging stations throughout the state.

The funds are available on a rolling basis starting on November 17 through the “Rebuild Illinois” capital plan for EV projects, authorized under the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

“Governor Pritzker has prioritized electrification of the transportation sector to improve air quality and benefit the health of our residents,” explained Illinois Acting Director James Jennings. “To support that priority, we are committed to expanding the charging infrastructure necessary to power current and future electric vehicles throughout Illinois.”

In addition to meeting pre-qualification standards, applicants must demonstrate that their location fills a gap in public charging station availability. Sites that serve public transportation networks or Park-and-Ride facilities also score extra points.

“Additional funding will also be awarded to projects at a charging station location in an area identified as an Equity Investment Eligible Community through the EIEC mapping tool,” the Illinois EPA also notes.

Plenty More Where That Came From

The new program in Illinois is just the tip of the EV charging station iceberg. The Electric Vehicle Council branch of the organization Transportation Energy Institute has just published a new white paper that identifies funding opportunities across the US. The EV Council also provides lessons-learned guidance for sorting through the application process.

“For those developing funding programs, the EV Council provides strategic recommendations for streamlining incentive programs and grant application processes, based upon the real-world experiences of those who have participated in such programs,” TEI explains.

NEVI Lives To Charge Another Day

One of the resources TEI identifies is the $5 billion in federal funds earmarked for new public EV fast-charging stations during the Biden administration under the NEVI (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) program.

And that’s where things get interesting. Launched in 2022 and funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the NEVI program assigned awards to all 50 states and tasked them with selecting locations that meet the funding criteria. However, some states were reluctant or unprepared to take advantage of the their awards before Biden left office in January.

The issue almost became moot after Trump took office and summarily ordered a halt to the program, but the courts eventually stepped in and ordered the funds to be restored. The EV charging software startup EV Connect is among the stakeholders following the NEVI saga. Their latest report shows that the program has a long way to go but it’s still alive and kicking.

“Progress has been steady but initially slow. As of mid-2025, only 148 chargers are operational across 12 states, with 84% of funds unobligated due to cumbersome regulations,” EV Connect reported on November 6.

Keep an eye out for activity to ramp up in the Southeast, which stakeholders have identified as a hotspot for EV charging stations and EV uptake, too.

EV Drivers Just Can’t Quit EVs

As for that EV uptake, some consumer surveys indicate that sales will eventually recover from the October debacle. “While the end of the EV tax credit will significantly affect EV sales volumes over the next several months, the bottom will not fall out of the EV market,” the firm JD Power reported on November 7.

“The percentage of active new-vehicle shoppers who say they are ‘very likely’ to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months increased to 24.2% in October, up from 21.6% in September,” the firm added.

JD Power also re-affirmed the well known fact that the TCO (total cost of ownership) for EVs can meet or beat conventional cars. “The number one reason EV owners select an EV over a gasoline-powered vehicle is expected lower running costs,” the firm noted, adding that in 86% of cases, EVs are “delivering on that expectation.”

Most surveys also show that a high percentage of EV drivers will choose another EV the next time they go car shopping. The new JD Power report is consistent with that, too.

“The data suggests that a significant number of current EV owners will be back in the market for a new car within the next year, and the majority of them plan to get another EV,” JD Power notes, citing the 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study. The EVX Study found that that 79% of current owners will definitely consider an EV for their next purchase, and another 15% will probably consider an EV.

“Furthermore, 243,000 franchise EV leases will come to an end in 2026, putting those customers back into the market for a new vehicle,” JD Power adds.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NEVI.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 13:18:57.804803

Summary

Late last month, Energy Transfer upped its quarterly distribution per unit once more.

The partnership recently announced agreements with Oracle, Fermi America, and Entergy Louisiana.

ET maintains BBB or BBB-equivalent credit ratings with S&P, Moody's, and Fitch.

Units are priced 17% below my fair value estimate.

Energy Transfer has a path to solid double-digit annual total returns over the next few years.

Associated Press

Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year's midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who's footing the bill to power Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that he’ll focus on affordability next year as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.

Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average - although not everywhere.

“There’s a lot of pressure on politicians to talk about affordability, and electricity prices are right now the most clear example of problems of affordability,” said Dan Cassino, a professor of politics and government and pollster at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.

Rising electric costs aren’t expected to ease and many Americans could see an increase on their monthly bills in the middle of next year's campaigns.

Gas and electric utilities are seeking or already secured rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period last year.

With some 80 million Americans struggling to pay their utility bills, “it’s a life or death and ‘eat or heat’ type decision that people have to make,” said Charles Hua, PowerLines' founder.

In Georgia, proposals to build data centers have roiled communities, while a victorious Democrat, Peter Hubbard, accused Republicans on the commission of “rubber-stamping” rate increases by Georgia Power, a subsidiary of power giant Southern Co.

Monthly Georgia Power bills have risen six times over the past two years, now averaging $175 a month for a typical residential customer.

Hubbard's message seemed to resonate with voters. Rebecca Mekonnen, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, said she voted for the Democratic challengers, and wants to see “more affordable pricing. That’s the main thing. It’s running my pocket right now.”

Now, Georgia Power is proposing to spend $15 billion to expand its power generating capacity, primarily to meet demand from data centers, and Hubbard is questioning whether data centers will pay their fair share - or share it with regular ratepayers.

Midterm elections will see congressional battlegrounds in states where fast-rising electric bills or data center hotspots - or both - are fomenting community uprisings.

That includes California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Analysts attribute rising electric bills to a combination of forces.

That includes expensive projects to modernize the grid and harden poles, wires and substations against extreme weather and wildfires.

Also playing a role is explosive demand from data centers, bitcoin miners and a drive to revive domestic manufacturing, as well as rising natural gas prices, analysts say.

“The cost of utility service is the new ‘cost of eggs’ concern for a lot of consumers,” said Jennifer Bosco of the National Consumer Law Center.

In some places, data centers are driving a big increase in demand, since a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes, according to the International Energy Agency. Some could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans.

While many states have sought to attract data centers as an economic boon, legislatures and utility commissions were also flooded with proposals to try to protect regular ratepayers from paying to connect data centers to the grid.

Meanwhile, communities that don't want to live next to one are pushing back.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October found that electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults.

Now, as falls turns to winter, some states are warning that funding for low-income heating aid is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown.

Still, the impact is still more uneven than other financial stressors like grocery costs, which just over half of U.S. adults said are a “major” source of stress.

And electric rates vary widely by state or utility.

For instance, federal data shows that for-profit utilities have been raising rates far faster than municipally owned utilities or cooperatives.

In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers - including data centers not even built yet.

Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.

That’s spurred governors from the region - including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Illinois’ JB Pritzker and Maryland’s Wes Moore, all Democrats who are running for reelection - to pressure the grid operator PJM Interconnection to contain increases.

Drew Maloney, the CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, singled out Democratic-leaning states as the drivers of higher electric bills.

“The red states’ electricity rates are not going up at the rate the blue states are,” Maloney said. “But the data centers are largely going to the red states and the rates are still stable.”

Pull out some of those fast-rising rates - like in California, where wildfires are driving grid upgrades, and New England, where natural gas is expensive - and the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates, Maloney said.

Still, blue states are attracting data centers, too, and some red states are seeing higher electric bills.

In Indiana, a growing data center hotspot, the consumer advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition, reported this year that residential customers of the state's for-profit electric utilities were absorbing the most severe rate increases in at least two decades.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun decried the hikes, saying “we can’t take it anymore.”

On another note, Anderson Clayton managed to throw the whole state auditor’s office into turmoil with a single tweet.
Again, Brian Anderson of Anderson Alerts got the whole story.
So the lessons of this story are listen to the people who know what they are doing and don’t mess with Anderson Clayton.","After Wednesday’s post, I got a bit of pushback because I didn’t mention North Carolina races. When I wrote my post early that morning, I didn’t have the information. Our state didn’t have any statewide or high-profile races, so the information wasn’t in one place. Most were relatively obscure municipal races in small towns across North Carolina. The information trickled in throughout the day.

I made up for it on Thursday. North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, former political reporter Travis Fain, and I recorded an election roundup. I hope you’ll watch it.

Democratic wins in North Carolina were both broad and deep. According to Anderson, the party flipped more than 150 seats and the wins came in small towns, big cities, and suburban areas. The Assembly called it a “blue wave” even though many races were ostensibly nonpartisan.

In Charlotte, Democrats swept contested city council races, leaving just one Republican on the council. In Wake County, Democratic candidates defeated Republican mayors in Wake Forest, Holly Springs, and Fuquay Varina. Only one of the 22 GOP endorsed candidates in Wake County won. Democrats won in places like Alamance County where they took mayoral seats in both Burlington and Graham. They also won big in Guilford and New Hanover Counties.

Anderson makes a great point on the podcast. Republicans have now become a nationalized party. Everything is about Donald Trump. They’ve lost sight of the local issues that so often drive the electorate. That might work in presidential years, but Republicans are failing when Trump’s not on the ballot.

Nationally, Republicans are publicly in denial, downplaying their losses. That might make their base feel better, but it doesn’t do anything to fix the problems that led to their defeat. In order to avoid a wave election in 2026, they need to change the political environment and hoping it’s going to change on its own is probably a bad bet.

The most powerful determinant in any election cycle is the political environment. The corollary to that rule is that voters are more motivated to vote against something than for it. Anger and fear are the greatest motivators, not hope and change. People who went to the polls this year sent a message to the Republicans. Whether they receive it or not probably determines what happens next November.

In North Carolina, a similar political environment in 2026 could hand Republicans stinging losses in their remaining suburban legislative seats and cost them ones in exurban counties like Alamance. As long as prices are rising, jobs are flat, our cities are under attack, and constantly changing tariff policies ensure economic uncertainty, former Governor Roy Cooper starts the election season with a favorable wind at his back. If Trump switches gears, the winds could shift, too.

On another note, Anderson Clayton managed to throw the whole state auditor’s office into turmoil with a single tweet. It’s a great story and one with lessons for anyone in politics or public service. Again, Brian Anderson of Anderson Alerts got the whole story. Read it here.

Apparently, the voter search tool on the State Board of Election’s website failed on the last day of early voting. The tool lets people see if they are currently registered and where they are supposed to vote. After the GOP legislature stripped control of the SBOE from the governor and gave it to Republican auditor Dave Boliek, that failure is a bit embarrassing. Democrats, of course, pounced because that’s what parties do.

The North Carolina Democratic Party twitter account blasted the SBOE for incompetence. They claimed the failure was “impacting poll workers’ ability to quickly identify and register voters.” That wasn’t quite right since the poll workers still had access to the voter rolls, but, hey, it’s Twitter and have you seen the stuff Republicans post?

Anderson reposted the tweets and wrote, “AND WHERE IN THE HELL IS STATE AUDITOR DAVE BOLIEK?” Instead of ignoring the political shots like a more seasoned political operation would have done, the SBOE decided they needed to elevate the back-and-forth. They sent out a press release blasting Clayton, who is not an elected or government official. She should take that press release as a badge of honor. Anytime you can make your opponents amplify your criticism of them, you’re winning the battle. Score one for Clayton.

(On a personal note, I’ve never been more proud than when Republicans filed complaints against me with the State Board of Elections because I was mean to them.)

Then, it comes out that the SBOE had an internal debate as to how to respond to the tweet in the first place. Patrick Gannon, the long-time spokesperson for the SBOE, is on paid leave for urging caution instead of reaction. Now, the story is not about the tweets but about turmoil within the SBOE. In addition, we all know that the newly formed State Board of Elections had problems in their first election cycle with the voter file tool. Score another for Clayton.

In the era of Trump, no slight goes unnoticed by Republicans. Thin-skin is the armor of the GOP. The SBOE should have listened to their communications professional. Patrick Gannon knew what to do, even if he’s paying the price for the incompetence of his bosses.

So the lessons of this story are listen to the people who know what they are doing and don’t mess with Anderson Clayton.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Uzs!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68d68f6d-f253-4b9c-8663-ae935f9efcfd_1360x770.avif",N,,2025-11-08 11:05:31.132572

Lawrence, who runs EV Auto Alex and has built a following of over 163,000 subscribers by providing insider advice on EV financing and buying, recorded the conversation at his standup desk inside his Utah dealership. The video captures a live phone call with a TikTok follower who had attempted to purchase a used Tesla Model 3 the previous day from what he described as ""a big dealer group in Utah.""

The Alleged Scheme Unfolds

The caller's account entails a blatant attempt to work around federal tax credit requirements. According to the transcript, the customer visited the dealership specifically looking for a used Model 3 that would qualify for the federal tax credit—meaning it had to be priced at $25,000 or less.

""Hey, man, I'm looking for a used Model 3. Something that qualifies for a tax credit, $25,000 or less,"" the caller told the salesperson. The dealer showed him a vehicle with what appeared to be a $28,500 price tag.

When the customer questioned the price discrepancy, the salesperson allegedly revealed their workaround strategy. ""So what we do to get around that is we charge you 24.5 [thousand] on paper for the Tesla. And then we charge you like four grand for a charger,"" the caller recounted.

Until it expired on Sept. 30, the federal tax credit for used EVs provided up to $4,000 for qualifying vehicles, if the total purchase price excluding taxes and registration fees was under $25,000.

By artificially separating charges and listing mandatory add-ons as separate items, the dealership was allegedly attempting to make an ineligible vehicle appear compliant with IRS requirements.

According to IRS guidance on the expired credit, the sale price includes all dealer-imposed costs or fees not required by law, specifically including ""the retail price for each accessory or item of optional equipment physically attached to the vehicle at the time of sale."" The IRS explicitly states that dealers cannot reduce the sales price of a used clean vehicle based on mandatory add-ons, as ""the amount of the reduction would be considered part of the sale price for purposes of the credit.""

Customer Pushes Back With Evidence

The customer wasn't convinced by the salesperson's assurances. Armed with knowledge from Lawrence's previous educational videos, he challenged the dealership.

""I just saw a video referring to your video saying that was used to be a gray area, but it was just cleared up where the total purchase price, excluding taxes and registration, has to be below $25,000,"" the customer told dealership staff.

The finance manager was brought in to handle the situation, but continued to insist their method was legitimate. When the customer showed them Lawrence's TikTok explaining the regulations, the finance manager allegedly ""tried to brush it off,"" saying ""no, man, that's totally fine. We've done this a bunch of times. It's all good.""

Lawrence was tickled by this turn of events. ""Are you serious? You showed the finance manager a video of me?"" he asked, adding ""That's awesome.""

Pressure Tactics Escalate

When the customer requested written guarantees that the dealership would cover the $4,000 if the tax credit was denied, the finance manager refused. According to the caller, the dealership then attempted an even more questionable approach.

""Ultimately, he says, 'listen, man, we're going to sell you this right now. Tax, title, out the door, 24.5 [thousand]. And then tomorrow you have to come in and pay us $2,000 for TIPS,'"" the customer recounted.

Lawrence immediately recognized the legal implications. ""He wanted to do a separate transaction. Two grand. Dude, that is so illegal,"" he responded.

Had the customer gone through with this, it would likely have constituted tax fraud. The IRS has clear authority to pursue such arrangements as abusive tax avoidance transactions, which include ""sham arrangements having no economic significance or business purpose other than the avoidance or evasion of tax.""

Understanding the Tax Credit Requirements

The federal used EV tax credit, which was officially known as the previously owned clean vehicle credit, had specific eligibility requirements designed to help lower-income buyers access electric vehicles. To qualify, the vehicle needed to:

Be purchased from a licensed dealer

Cost no more than $25,000

Be at least two years old

Meet income requirements for the buyer

The IRS had been clear that the $25,000 limit applied to the total purchase price excluding only taxes, title, and registration fees. IRS documentation specified that the sale price ""includes all dealer-imposed costs or fees not required by law"" and explicitly included ""dealer documentation fees, which are part of the cost of purchasing a vehicle and are not required by federal or state law.""

Mandatory dealer add-ons, accessories, and extended warranties also needed to be included in the purchase price calculation.

The EV incentive was ended after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed on July 4, eliminated it.

Community Response and Industry Recognition

The video sparked hundreds of comments from viewers, with many sharing similar experiences at dealerships across the country. Several commenters specifically mentioned dealership groups by name, suggesting the practice may be more widespread than initially apparent.

User Dylan Ericksen commented that a local dealership group was ""doing what they do best 10/10 don't recommend.”

Another commenter, asell87, shared their own experience with what appeared to be the same dealership group: ""I left a 1 star review after my experience. They called and sent me a check for $100 to remove the review. They are sleezy.""

When Lawrence asked for more information, asell87 elaborated, ""They called me after I left the review and said how about we send you $100 for the problems with the tire and have you remove that review. I received the $100 for the tire, but kept the review up because they definitely deserve it and want to warn others.""

Motor1 reached out to the alleged dealership via email for comment. We'll update this if it responds.

Customer Buys Their EV Elsewhere

Despite the frustrating experience, the story had a happy conclusion. Lawrence offered the customer ""$1,000 off any car I have"" for ""being such a good dude and doing the right thing."" The customer took him up on the offer, with Lawrence confirming in the comments that he ""came right in and bought"" a vehicle from EV Auto Alex.

The video also served an educational purpose, with several industry professionals commenting that they had learned from Lawrence's content. User brianatbutler wrote, ""I just got my dealership on board with this because of your videos! My managers had no idea about this. So thank you!!""

Dealership Workers Weigh In

The video attracted attention from dealership employees who wanted to ensure their own stores weren't engaging in similar practices. Halye commented, ""I work for a big dealership in Northern Utah and listen to these videos to get clues to make sure it's not any of ours. I have not come across any [dealerships] doing this so far!""

Lawrence responded that he wasn't ""aware of anyone in Davis county and north doing this,"" suggesting the practice might be concentrated in specific areas or dealer groups.

The Broader Implications

Lawrence's video highlights the importance of consumer education in navigating complex federal incentive programs. His approach—combining entertainment with practical advice—has clearly resonated with EV buyers who need reliable information in a rapidly evolving market.

The incident also demonstrates how social media can serve as a check on questionable business practices. The customer's decision to show Lawrence's educational content to the dealership staff shows how informed consumers can push back against potentially fraudulent schemes.

Lawrence indicated in the comments that he was aware of ""three"" dealerships engaging in similar practices and was ""trying to reach their owners direct man to man first"" before taking further action, suggesting he's taking a measured approach to addressing the issue.

About First Public Hydrogen The First Public Hydrogen Authority (FPH2) is the United States’ 1st public hydrogen utility, designed to connect hydrogen producers with end users through a transparent, cost-effective model.","Following yesterday’s announcement that the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) is pausing operations, the First Public Hydrogen Authority (FPH2) reassures stakeholders that hydrogen markets remain strong. The partnerships, infrastructure, and market activity built through ARCHES are key elements to hydrogen deployment, and we look forward to building on their success.

FPH2’s recent hydrogen supply solicitation drew a broad range of hydrogen suppliers, many new to the California market and ready to invest in our state, a clear indicator of an expanding renewable hydrogen market. Just last week, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) approved repowering Scattergood Generating Station, to a hydrogen-ready power plant. This will be the first large-scale green hydrogen power plant in California and the second hydrogen power plant for LADWP.

Additionally, the terminal operators and Port officials at nearly every port in California are unwaveringly pursuing new hydrogen solutions to help meet their clean air goals. Despite some changes with federal energy policy, we see strong and consistent public and private sector investment in the hydrogen economy in California, and growing interest in investing in equipment to integrate hydrogen as a renewable fuel in their operations. Looking across the hydrogen market in California, we need all renewable hydrogen projects to move forward to meet the new demand on the horizon; it is a very exciting time for California’s green economy and for hydrogen.

“Hydrogen is a key driver for new jobs and a critical element to achieve energy diversity and energy independence,” said FPH2 Chairman R. Rex Parris. “The global hydrogen economy is estimated to be just above $200 billion and growing. The US hosts more than 20% of the global economy, with California leading as one of the nation’s largest hydrogen economies and growing.”

“I have complete trust and confidence that First Public Hydrogen Authority will continue to do the heavy lifting required to get a robust supply of cost-effective hydrogen in time to meet our climate and energy goals and supply our hydrogen needs at the port complex,” said Matt Dickenson, Sustainability Director, Energy, & Decarbonization Manager for Fenix Marine.

Cities and transit agencies across the region, including Lancaster, Industry, Montebello, and others, are transitioning to hydrogen-powered buses, vehicles, backup uses such as traffic signals, and stationary power solutions. Despite the cancellation of federal funding, private-sector hydrogen suppliers and end users continue to pursue their projects. We will need all the new planned hydrogen production projects in the state to meet this growing demand we see on the horizon.

“Local work continues. Our customers are moving forward, suppliers are scaling, and the momentum remains strong. California’s hydrogen progress has always been built from the ground up, by cities, transit agencies, municipal utilities, ports, skilled labor, and industry working together,” said Ernesto Medrano, Executive Secretary of the Los Angeles/Orange Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.

FPH2, the nation’s first public hydrogen utility, was created by cities to ensure that hydrogen deployment could continue reliably regardless of changes at the federal level. The Authority will continue to collaborate closely with partners and will sustain progress toward statewide clean-energy goals, local job creation, and long-term energy reliability.

Hydrogen activity in California has not paused. The projects are active, the partnerships are strong, and the work continues across communities statewide.

The list is based on an array of tests, in-depth reviews, and State Of Charge’s ChargerRater scores.

We believe that this is an invaluable resource for all in the market for residential EV charging equipment. The competition between the top models is fierce. Each model offers its own advantages and disadvantages. The common characteristics they all share are high-quality, reliability, Wi-Fi connectivity, and have received Tom’s seal of approval.

This year, the best products come from five manufacturers: ChargePoint, Emporia, EVIQO, Tesla, and United Chargers.

* Charging stations are often called simply “chargers”, although technically speaking, they are AC charging stations that only supply power to the car’s onboard charger.

In the article, we have attached links to some of the products in our shop, or to Amazon/manufacturer websites with referral codes, which we hope you might consider using to support State Of Charge and the EVChargingStations website.

The Best Home EV Charging Stations Of 2025 (Up to 12 kW)

ChargePoint Home Flex

The top five list opens up with the ChargePoint Home Flex, a 12-kW (50 amps at 240 volts) hardwired charging station with a SAE J1772 or NACS charging connector. The product is also available in a plug-in configuration (NEMA 14-50 or even NEMA 6-50), but the power is then limited to 9.6 kW (up to 40 amps at 240 volts).

The ChargePoint Home Flex has one of the best connectors (rubberized), an outstanding charging cable especially for cold-weather use, and a convenient integrated connector holster.

The smart app is advanced. However, Tom noted that one can’t connect two charging units in the same app, which may be an inconvenience in households with multiple stations. The charger also does not offer dynamic load management or power sharing features.

The hardwired version’s price is as low as $539 as of the posting of this article, while the NEMA 14-50 plug-in version is a bit more expensive at $599 (manufacturer’s regular price).

A unique feature of ChargePoint’s product is the option ($199) to switch the charging cable/connector from SAE J1772 to NACS (or vice versa). This might be helpful when switching from SAE J1772 to NACS in the future.

The ChargePoint Home Flex (hardwired version) received a total score of 86 points or 4.3/5 stars on the new, redesigned version of State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. That’s a really good result.

Emporia Pro

The Emporia Pro debuts in State Of Charge’s top picks, in some way replacing the previous “Emporia” model, which remains on the market under a new name as the “Emporia Classic”.

The Emporia Pro is a high-end charger with numerous smart charging features (see the recent review from June 2025). The hardwired version can deliver up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts), while the plug-in version with a NEMA 14-50 plug is rated at up to 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts).

Buyers can select a SAE J1772 connector or the new NACS connector option (Q4 2025) at purchase. The charging cable is thin, flexible (even in cold weather), and light, which makes things easier. The one thing that Tom dislikes is the connector holster — a bit thin and flimsy, but it can be replaced with a third-party product.

The Emporia Pro really shines when it comes to its software and smart features. It’s quickly becoming the go-to product for EV owners with a maxed-out utility service rating because its features enable them to avoid a costly electric panel upgrade.

Its Dynamic Load Balancing monitors the total draw of the home — including the charger — and temporarily limits the charger’s power as needed. This is a game-changing feature, which State Of Charge already had an opportunity to highlight in some of its recent videos: Installing a high-powered Emporia Pro EV charger in an apartment with a 100-amp electric service and Emporia Pro installation in a garage to solve the limited power issue.

The Emporia Pro’s regular price is $599, but considering its capabilities, it represents very high value.

The hardwired version of the Emporia Pro received a total score of 87 points or 4.35/5 stars on State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Honorable Mention: Emporia Classic

Before we move on, it’s worth making a slight pause for an honorable mention: the Emporia Classic. It is a less advanced version (no features like dynamic load balancing), but the cost is a quarter lower (check our shop here). It was one of the top models in 2024.

Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A from United Chargers is another new charging station on the list (in previous years, Tom listed the 40-amp Classic version). It’s a hardwired charging station with a power output of up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts), and two charging connector options (SAE J1772 or NACS).

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A is a heavyweight contender. It has an extremely durable case for outdoor use, a nice, thin charging cable, an “ok” connector, and a remote connector holster. Tom describes the Grizzl-E Ultimate as a very good unit, available at an excellent price ($479.99 as of the posting of this article).

As with any charging station, the Grizzl-E Ultimate has some weaker points. Tom mentioned that it lacks advanced smart charging features, such as dynamic load management or power sharing. The app functionality is limited, although one can pair the charger to a different app, which is quite unique for United Chargers.

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A received a total score of 88 points or 4.4/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Honorable Mention: Grizzl-E Classic

Because not everyone needs a 48-amp charger, Tom made an honorable mention of the Grizzl-E Classic plug-in version for a NEMA 14-50 outlet. It has a slightly lower power of up to 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts), but has an even more attractive price of $349.99. Currently, the Classic version is available only with the SAE J1772 connector (no NACS option yet).

EVIQO Evipower Gen2

In 2025, EVIQO introduced its second-generation smart residential charging station: the Evipower Gen2. The first-generation was among our most recommended models in 2024, and the new Gen 2 is even better, according to State Of Charge’s recent review.

The revised and improved EVIQO Evipower Gen2 comes in two versions: a hardwired version with a maximum power output of 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts) and a plug-in version (NEMA 14-50) with a maximum power output of 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts). Both can be ordered with either a SAE J1772 or a NACS charging connector.

The hardwired EVIQO Evipower Gen2 is a very high-quality product at an attractive price of just over $400 (down from the regular $599). The plug-in version costs $371.15 as of the posting of this article. For the best EVIQO Evipower prices, also check our affiliate link on Amazon; just make sure you select the Gen 2 version.

The second generation has an excellent charging cable with outstanding cold-weather performance (on par with ChargePoint). The charging connector is fantastic — solid, heavy, with a metal locking tab and rubberized grip. The connector holster is nice, too.

On the negative side, the app could benefit from additional features. There is no dynamic load management or power sharing between multiple units.

The EVIQO Evipower Gen2 received a total score of 88 points or 4.4/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Tesla Wall Connector & Tesla Universal Wall Connector

Tesla, the brand that needs no introduction in the EV industry, entered the charging business very early. Its third-generation charging stations are one of the best on the market.

Currently, Tesla offers two main hardwired charging stations: the Wall Connector (NACS charging connector) and the Universal Wall Connector (NACS charging connector with an integrated SAE J1772 adapter). They are both rated at up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts). There is no plug-in version for NEMA 14-50.

The two units are basically the same. The Universal Wall Connector can be used to charge EVs with a SAE J1772 charging port, which is important during the transition period from CCS1 to NACS in North America. Additionally, it has Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) capability when paired with the Tesla Cybertruck. However, the Universal Wall Connector costs $600, compared to $450 for the basic Wall Connector.

Strong points of the Tesla Wall Connectors are their thin and flexible charging cables and integration with Tesla’s software ecosystem. Multiple charging stations can share power between them (as far as we know, they must be the same generation). There is even a dynamic load management feature, but it’s not easy to set up, which Tom describes in detail in the video.

Before purchasing, one should make sure that the side-mounted connector holster fits their garage layout.

The Tesla Universal Wall Connector received a total score of 89 points or 4.45/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. This unit is especially recommended for EV users with SAE J1772-compatible vehicles who want to stay future-proof with the NACS charging standard.

The Tesla Wall Connector does not offer SAE J1772 charging option, but with a noticeably lower price it’s a very competitive charging station for all those who already stick with the NACS-compatible EVs.

Thanks to its competitive price, the Tesla Wall Connector received a total score of 91 points or 4.55/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. That’s the highest score ever on the newly revised ChargerRater.

Full Power: 19.2 kW

Most EVs on the market in North America have onboard chargers rated at 7-12 kW, so 9.6-12 kW charging stations (40-50 amps at 240 volts) are the mainstream standard. However, some EVs have larger batteries and higher power chargers (up to 19.2 kW). To maximize charging, an 80-amp charger is the way to go. As a bonus recommendation, Tom selected one 80-amp charging station for this list.

Grizzl-E Ultimate 80A

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 80A offers up to 19.2 kW of power (80 amps at 240 volts), provided one has an available 100-amp circuit (see a related review here). This model features the same capabilities as the lower-power Ultimate 48A version, which is among the top picks.

The price is higher at $899.99, but it’s very competitive compared to other 80-amp chargers.

Final Thoughts

At the end of his video for the best home EV charging stations of 2025, Tom Moloughney recommends hardwired installations as a more reliable option. If one prefers a plug-in configuration, it would be good to seek a model with a temperature sensor in the NEMA 14-50 plug.

Another thing is to prioritize quality, reliability, and safety over price. The installation should be inspected to minimize the risk of any issues arising over the years, or even a fire. EV charging stations draw high power over multiple hours, day after day, which is an entirely different duty cycle than other electric appliances in a household.

I was as skeptical as the next person: would making the transition to an EV result in driving a in a car I hate? Would driving an EV be a compromise?

Back in the day, EVs were small, often odd-looking and didn’t fit my need for kids, car seats and winter driving. They were fair-weather rides that sounded good but in practice, could be lacking.

Then came the EV revolution, with cars like the Kia EV9, the Mustang Mach-E and the Volvo EX90 as options for drivers and families who want to bypass the gas station and go electric. Those cars changed everything.

And now, I find myself among EV drivers, too. As a car reviewer, I drive a lot of every type of c ar, but my go-to every day, and the subject of a lot of my experience and stories, is the Hyundai Ioniq 5.

Why I Love My EV: It’s Just So Good

After driving many of the EVs on the road I began to appreciate the finesse of the EV experience: one-pedal driving which basically allows you to use only the accelerator to speed up or slow down, using the brake rarely if at all. The feel and experience of this is simply superior to driving a gas-powered car.

Add to that brake hold, which allows you to take your foot off the brake when you’ve stopped, is just incredible. It’s one of those things that once you get used to it, going back to regular driving just feels wrong.

Driving an EV Couldn’t Be Easier

I also love the quiet start of the car, the easy drive and the instant torque: taking off when the traffic light turns green is so quick, and merging onto the highway is a new delight.

But plugging in your car in your own garage and never having to think about stopping to fuel up is simply the best. I can think about charging the car when it’s convenient for me, not when it’s necessary or I happen to drive by a gas station.

And, charging at home is cheaper, even when you consider the cost of adding a charger to your garage or exterior of the house.

Charging an EV at home Saves Time and Money

For years, getting gas was the biggest pain of the week. The gas station was out of the way, the opposite direction of school, dance class, my work spot and the grocery store. And, there was always a line; it was cold/hot/rainy/sweaty. And expensive. Sometimes it would cost me $50 to fill the car, other times that same fill-up was $75. Never predictable.

Charging a car at home is the opposite. I can plug the car in at night, let it charge to my preferred 80% and it turns off when it’s done. I get into the car in the morning with a full charge (or, really, 80%) and I’m on my way.

EVs can charge using a standard household outlet, or they can charge faster with a level 2 charger. The difference is about 3-5 miles per hour added to the range with a 110V household outlet vs about 25 miles charged per hour at a 240V outlet.

How I Updated My Garage to Charge At Home

To facilitate a level 2 charger at home, I added a home charge outlet to my garage. Because I’m, uh, thrifty, I looked at how to do this safely but at the lowest cost: add a 240V outlet and a smart charge cord. Here’s what it cost:

$150 for the electrician to install the outlet

$230 for the smart charger

$20 for the cord hook to hold the charge cord

I didn’t need to do any work on my electrical panel or update any of the electrical systems in my house. Essentially, if you have an electric clothes dryer, you can add an EV charger. The smart cord, which is wifi-enabled, lets me turn on and off charging from my app and set the amperage level. The most powerful circuit breaker in my electrical panel is a 30 amp breaker, so I set the charge level to 24 and voila, no additional work needed to charge my EV. Even at 24 amps, it fully charges overnight.

Incentives Are Still a Thing—You Can Find Them Here

We all heard the sad news a couple of months ago when the federal government phased out EV incentives for new and used car purchases. But that does’t mean that incentives are gone; in fact, the local power company covered half the cost of my EV charger installation. It’s in their best interest, after all, to power my car, right?

And many states, utilities and others provide incentives, and some of them are quite generous. Electric For All provides an incentive locator by zip code so you can see what is available and how to qualify.

Ready to Take the Plunge? Where to Test Drive an EV

One of my favorite events each year is Electrify Expo, the all-electric auto show that tours the US each year; you can find the rest of this year’s schedule here. If you missed your local EE event don’t fret; almost all auto shows, from the LA Auto Show taking place later this month to the New York Auto Show in April, 2026 and many in between will have EV test drives. You can check the web site of your local auto show and find out if EV drives are available.

Or, head to the dealership of the model you’d like to test out. They keep a test model on hand just for that purpose—and even if you really love it, they won’t let you buy it, but they’ll help you place an order.

And get ready to fall in love, with the cars, the drive experience and the lifestyle. Because it’s just so good.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/a_girls_guide_to_cars_articles_379/471dd7e4eb84d9ef332343969a2ca7d6,N,,2025-11-08 09:19:21.619342

“What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power.","LUSBY, Md. — Constellation announced a long-range proposal on Nov. 4 to invest in up to 5,800 megawatts of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland. According to the company’s release, the goal is to “meet rising demand for electricity, lower utility bills and usher in the next generation of clean and lower-carbon energy resources to power the state’s economic growth.”

The company proposed several projects as part of the state’s effort to fast-track innovative energy investments. Short-term projects include 1,500 megawatts of fast-track initiatives that could help address near-term needs, including battery storage and natural gas-powered solutions. Calvert Cliffs is part of the long-term proposal, as per the release:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center: Relicensing the state’s only nuclear plant to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 megawatts of clean generation that serves more than 1.3 million homes. Absent the license extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036, respectively.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10 percent, or 190 megawatts, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 megawatts of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.

Nuclear energy is considered clean energy, and more nuclear energy programs are supported by a variety of groups.

The proposal also includes ways to make the energy market more competitive, which will, in theory, lower the cost for consumers.

“What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation,” said Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez.

Can V2G and bidirectional charging be a game-changer for renewable energy?

V2G is the missing link for fully unlocking India’s renewable potential. Solar and wind energy are intermittent. EVs, acting as mobile storage units, are a solution to solve this instability problem. Bi-directional charging allows these assets to dynamically stabilise the grid during peak demand or when renewable generation dips. This capability transforms an EV fleet into a distributed energy reservoir, significantly accelerating the reliable integration of clean energy sources. We believe this is fundamental to India’s energy future, providing the required flexibility to the grid.

What’s the potential Impact of V2G on renewable energy and decarbonisation – any short/long-term targets we could aim for?

The impact is often monumental in such cases. Short-term, V2G pilots, especially for fleet operators, can demonstrate 5-10 MW of flexible localised capacity within 18-24 months. In the long term, our goal should be to leverage the entire EV population to displace gas peaker plants and store gigawatts of renewable energy. In the near future, V2G could contribute to some reduction in national peak power demand by 2035, playing a crucial role in meeting India’s decarbonisation commitments by ensuring our clean power is accessible 24/7.

What steps are needed for the integration of V2G-enabled EVs into the grid? – How long until we can see commercial assets/models being rolled out?

Well, there are three steps to this. First, establishing robust communication standards (like ISO 15118) for seamless grid interaction, after which, second is securing regulatory clarity from utilities and finally, launching large-scale pilot projects. Servotech is actively developing the necessary bi-directional hardware and we anticipate that focused commercial models, likely starting with captive fleets like corporate or transit buses, could see initial rollouts within 3 to 5 years, with mass market visibility following regulatory approval.

What type of govt policies/incentives do we require for V2G to work?

Firstly, we require clear and consistent policy direction, then the most vital incentives are Time-of-Use tariffs that financially reward EV owners for discharging energy during grid stress and perhaps federal grants for V2G-enabled charger installations. Furthermore, mandating smart meter penetration and standardising communication protocols are essential. In my professional opinion, a guaranteed rate of return for V2G participation is necessary to make the financial case compelling for the average consumer, driving initial adoption.

How can the auto industry overcome the complexities of infrastructure and interoperability – what factors can affect the economic case?

The auto industry must embrace standardisation as a primary undertaking, specifically adhering to global interoperability protocols like ISO 15118 for charging and communication. This would minimise the complexity and risk, as the economic case is fragile and is affected by high battery costs and uncertain lifetime revenues. Success depends on showcasing the total cost of ownership benefit to fleet owners. The car is not just a means of transport, but a revenue-generating asset used to offset purchase price and operational expenses.

Milestones and infrastructure developments are needed to move towards mass adoption.

There are certain milestones that we need to achieve to meet nationwide charger-to-EV ratio targets, driven by public-private partnerships. Infrastructure must evolve beyond basic AC charging to a pervasive DC bidirectional charging capability across urban centres. We also need smart grid readiness, meaning every V2G asset is connected through a unified, secure cloud platform for dynamic power management. These foundational steps, supported by robust cybersecurity frameworks, are critical to ensuring mass adoption is not only widespread but also safely managed by the grid operators.

What are the concerns about battery degradation?

Battery degradation is a legitimate concern, as excessive V2G cycling can impact battery lifespan. However, this is largely a technical challenge that can be overcome. We are focused on developing intelligent Battery Management Systems that use sophisticated algorithms to optimise charging/discharging cycles. This ensures grid service only occurs within ideal state-of-charge ranges, thus minimising stress. Furthermore, V2G services will be prioritised for commercial fleets where asset utilisation and managed charging cycles are already highly optimised.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/11/08/Untitled-design-3-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 13:01:35.882430

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Tuesday was a great day at the ballot box for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide.

In races from New York to Georgia to Washington, voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit—and the people promising to deliver those policies. On the whole, the results suggest Americans are pushing back against President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back climate action.

“This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump Administration’s ban on clean energy, multimillion-dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher,” Sara Schreiber of the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

One of the day’s biggest wins came in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race in a landslide victory called just 35 minutes after polls closed. More than two million New Yorkers voted, the most in a mayoral race since 1969. Although Mamdani, who at 34 will be the city’s youngest mayor in more than a century, made affordability the predominant focus of his campaign, he garnered an endorsement from the youth-led climate organization Sunrise Movement. Many saw his campaign promises, which included calls for free mass transit and the greening of public schools, as the seeds of a populist climate movement.

“Zohran was talking about climate action in a way people could understand, and people were able to see the impacts of this climate action in their everyday lives,” Denae Ávila-Dickson, Sunrise’s communications and political manager, told New York Focus.

Dan Jasper, of the nonprofit group Project Drawdown, said Mamdani’s transit proposal “is not as sexy as something like solar. But these are the exact type of policies we’re going to need to actually address climate change, because it addresses people’s standards of living.”

Mamdani’s challenge will be assembling the coalition needed to make those policies happen. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has also promoted a municipal green new deal agenda, may not have similar difficulty. Yesterday, Wu’s City Council allies retained their seats, giving her a fighting chance at success.

As far as statewide elections go, Georgia was a point of contention: There, electricity prices were on the ballot. Democrats won two of the five seats on the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees utilities and has approved six rate increases in three years.

Democrats have not held a seat on the board since 2007, but clean energy consultant Peter Hubbard and anti-poverty advocate Alicia Johnson tapped voter outrage over climbing prices and notched upset victories over Republican incumbents, who had embraced fossil fuels and backed away from clean energy at a time when demand for power is rising.

“I think for a lot of folks who have felt powerless over rising utility bills, especially in a state like Georgia where they’ve gone up for the average household by more than $500 in just the last couple of years, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that potential change is coming,” said Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy nonprofit PowerLines.

Rising energy bills emerged as a top issue in other races, too, including the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. For political scientist Leah Stokes, who studies public opinion around climate change, Tuesday’s results weren’t unexpected.

“I think yesterday was a repudiation of the idea that Americans don’t care about energy or climate and these are losing issues, which is what all of these pundits have been going on and on about for about 9 months now. That’s really wrong,” Stokes said on Wednesday. “Everyday people understand that clean energy is cheap energy—they can easily make those connections.”

In New Jersey, governor-elect Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs” on her first day in office. She plans to roll out expanded generation capacity, including rooftop solar and battery storage, and “immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity.”

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s seat on a platform that included data center operators paying for their own electricity costs in a region that currently hosts over 13 percent of the world’s data center capacity. Her “Affordable Virginia” plan included calls to expand wind and solar power, promote home weatherization to ease power consumption, and streamline permitting and other requirements for expanding generation.

To the west, California voters approved Proposition 50, which will allow the state’s Democratic majority to sidestep the statewide redistricting commission and redraw congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The move was designed to give Democrats as many as five more seats in Congress in an effort to, among other things, combat further dismantling of climate and environmental policy. Governor Gavin Newsom and a slate of prominent Democrats nationwide championed the proposal as a counterbalance to Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas, where a similar effort earlier this year carved out 5 new seats for the GOP.

In a speech Tuesday night, Newsom said California voters approved the measure “to send a message to Donald Trump. No crowns, no thrones, no kings. That’s what this victory represents. [It] is a victory for the people of the state of California and the United States of America.”

Climate-friendly policies—those centering on transit, in particular—won on a local scale, too. Voters in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which includes the city of Charlotte, handily approved a 1 percent increase in the sales tax to finance nearly $20 billion in transportation improvements. Although 40 percent of the additional revenue will be allocated to roads, some of that funding will support new bike lanes and sidewalks. Another 40 percent will go toward rail, and the remainder will be dedicated to buses and microtransit. In Ellensburg, Washington, 65 percent of voters approved a permanent 0.2 percent sales tax to fund the municipal bus system.

Across the country, one thing was clear: Wallet-friendly climate policies—and candidates presenting themselves as helping people pay their bills—won. “Climate change isn’t at the forefront of every election, but at this point, every election is a climate election,” Jasper of Project Drawdown said. “‘Climate action equals affordability’ seems to be the winning message of the day.”

But the most notable portent wasn’t the governor’s races won by Abigail Spanberger in Virginia or Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. Nor was it Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City.

The most significant win for Democrats was in two little-watched races for Georgia’s utility board. Little-watched outside of Georgia, that is.

These races are important for several reasons. No Democrat has been elected to the five-member Georgia Public Service Commission since 2007. Georgia has become a bellwether in the conservative South, and it has 14 House seats.

What the above outcomes indicate is that much of the electorate has had it with Donald Trump: Tariff chaos. The fake wars waged on our cities’ streets. Bankrupt farms. Blatant corruption. The destruction of democratic institutions. It’s obviously getting harder for Trump to bully election officials in Georgia or elsewhere to “find” more votes than a candidate won.

Sherrill’s opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, might have done a lot better if he didn’t have Trump hanging around his neck. He was known as a moderate, the sort of Republican who can get elected in New Jersey. But he blew it playing cultural warrior, MAGA style.

As an aside, the media should stop making a big deal about Spanberger becoming “Virginia’s First Female Governor.” America currently has 12 women serving as governors. Several oversee conservative states: Kay Ivey in Alabama, Kim Reynolds in Iowa, Laura Kelly in Kansas and Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas.

Spanberger came with an impressive background as a representative who had worked for the CIA. Sherrill, by the way, is preceded in the New Jersey governor’s mansion by Christine Todd Whitman (1994-2001).

The outcome in the races for Georgia’s utility board also reflected frustration with climbing electricity bills. Spiking electric costs are plaguing Americans all over the country, and they will get worse as large data centers rush in to scoop up available energy supplies.

Nationally, electricity prices have jumped 10% since January. Trump is making matters worse by ditching the Biden-era subsidies for clean energy. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill chops $500 billion from those projects.

So hot are Republicans to kill off these new energy sources that they’re stranding capital already invested in them. In August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order on a major wind project off New England that’s already 80% built. The bureau cited “concerns related to the protection of national security interests” without saying what they were. It took a federal court to lift that order.

Starting with Obama, America had pursued an all-of-the-above energy policy. That meant using traditional fossil fuels, the clean renewables and emerging sources, such as nuclear power, hydrogen and biofuels. (Texas is very good at this.) Now the policy is to stop the green-energy part, including infrastructure that even some oil companies supported.

The political battle that got the most attention was the race for New York mayor. The reasons were the colorful personalities, Mamdani’s controversial past and a Republican spoiler who wouldn’t leave the race. Add to that the New York-based media’s obsession with New York.

Mamdani has taken some of the edge off his more radical ideas by making nice with the “power brokers” he campaigned against. The hope is that he focuses on governing pragmatically — for which he will need some adult supervision. Unlike fellow Democratic Socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York mayor is an executive position overseeing a very complex organization. And no, Mamdani can’t single-handedly raise taxes on the rich.

But again, let’s not dwell on New York. For the most significant omen of Democrats’ prospects in the midterms, look to Georgia.

Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece.","Michigan regulators on Thursday adopted landmark standards for the booming data center industry with a plan they say tries to protect residents from subsidizing the industry’s hefty energy use.

In a 3-0 vote, the Michigan Public Service Commission adopted a rate structure that requires data centers and other energy-intensive industries in Consumers Energy’s territory to sign long-term power contracts with steep penalties for exiting early.

The order also requires Consumers to show that data centers will shoulder all costs to build transmission lines, substations and other infrastructure before adding them to the grid.

Commission Chair Dan Scripps called it a “balanced approach” that shows Michigan is “open for business from data centers and other large load customers, while also leveraging those potential benefits of the growth … in a way that’s good for all customers.”

The deal disappointed some environmentalists, who had pushed for explicit requirements that data center power come from renewable sources. Michigan utilities are legally required to achieve 100% clean energy by 2040. They must detail how they plan to meet that requirement in filings next year.

“While the order includes important consumer protection terms, the commission missed an opportunity to emphasize the importance of the state’s climate goals,” said Daniel Abrams, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

The rate structure applies to customers whose energy use exceeds 100 megawatts. Data centers are among very few industries that demand that much power. Often, they demand an order of magnitude more.

Consumers serves 1.9 million customers across much of the Lower Peninsula. Company spokesperson Matt Johnson said officials are still reviewing Thursday’s order and “its impact on all stakeholders.

“Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state’s economic development,” he added.

The deal comes amid an uncertain time for the data industry, which is growing fast because of artificial intelligence. Much more energy is needed to power the transformation, but many industry analysts fear rising AI stocks are a bubble and demand for the technology won’t materialize, leaving utilities and ratepayers to pick up the infrastructure tab for failed projects.

Hoping to avoid such an outcome, Consumers in February proposed special regulations that would lock data centers into 15-year contracts that guarantee consistent electricity use and require payments even if a facility ceases or downsizes operations mid-contract.

The commission’s decision Thursday approves much of that request, with some significant modifications.

DTE takes a different approach

The other big utility in Michigan, DTE Energy, is taking a different approach.

Rather than establishing a blanket rate structure like Consumers, DTE wants to negotiate its first data center contract individually while aiming to avoid public vetting of the deal.

After announcing last week that it had inked an agreement to supply power for a proposed Stargate data center in Saline Township, DTE filed a draft 19-year contract with state energy regulators and requested swift approval without a public hearing.

Michigan law allows such expedited reviews in cases that would bring no added costs to utility consumers.

DTE officials argue adding the Stargate data center to its system will help keep rates down for everyone by spreading fixed costs among more paying customers.

“Given the sizable affordability benefits for our customers, as well as the economic impact the project will have, we think moving forward in this fashion makes the most sense,” spokesperson Jill Wilmot said.

But DTE officials also stated in its filing that the company expects to spend some $500 million upgrading its transmission system and building a substation to serve the data center. Critics argue the utility is so intentionally vague it is impossible to vet DTE’s claims about affordability.

“It’s just highly concerning that they are trying to keep this somewhat private, because there’s so much at stake,” said Bryan Smigielski, a Michigan organizer with the Sierra Club.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also opposes DTE’s quest for expedited review, and has requested a thorough vetting of the proposed contract.

Members of the Public Service Commission have not decided whether to grant DTE’s request for quick approval, Scripps said.

Michigan’s data center electricity rate deliberations come amid a surge of interest from developers looking to take advantage of new tax breaks that could save the industry tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers last year voted to exempt large data centers from Michigan’s 6% sales and use tax in an effort to lure the industry to Michigan.

Beyond the Stargate campus, DTE is in late-stage negotiations for another 3 gigawatts’ worth of data center capacity, while Consumers Energy is nearing deals for three large data centers amounting to a collective 2 gigawatts of power.

Developers are also scoping out rural land throughout the southern Lower Peninsula, from the Grand Rapids area to the outskirts of Monroe.

The wave of interest could have big implications for water and land use in Michigan. Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece. Those that use water vapor to cool the servers inside the facilities — the industry’s most common cooling technique — also use large amounts of water.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.thealpenanews.com/images/2025/11/07151127/AP25293782583792-1-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:06:32.617877

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs.

The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago. A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

• West Virginia: Up 27.71 percent

• Ohio: Up 30.11 percent

• Pennsylvania: Up 30.85 percent

• Virginia: Up 19.78 percent

• Kentucky: Up 17.66 percent

• North Carolina: up 24.17 percent

• Texas: Up 27.58 percent

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69 percent capacity all the time or forgo the ability to recoup future costs.

The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and solar farms.

The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market.

The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid — coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total generation: 87,551 megawatts

• Natural gas – 33,469 MW (38.22 percent)

• Nuclear: 28,371 MW (32.41 percent)

• Coal; 13,197 MW (15.07 percent)

• Renewable energy: 10,043 MW (11.47 percent)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: Natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per megawatt hour, while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh — nearly 50 percent more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69 percent when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed.

Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need — or want — to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity — ultimately increasing your power bill.

Should America invest more in EV battery tech?","A pair of companies is partnering to lead the way in increasing production of EV batteries in the United States.

Epsilon Advanced Materials (EAM) and Phillips 66 have teamed up to support the domestic electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage system (ESS) battery supply chain, according to Batteries News. EAM is a manufacturer of sustainable battery materials, and Phillips 66 is a leading producer of synthetic graphite anodes, a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which are the go-to choice for EV batteries.

The way the partnership will work is that Phillips 66 will provide Green and Calcined Needle Coke (which goes into the synthetic graphite anodes) from its refinery in Louisiana to support EAM's graphite active anode material facility in North Carolina, currently under development.

EAM's facility is on track to begin operations in 2027 and is expected to provide enough graphite active anode to power approximately one million EVs a year.

""This collaboration is a major step in building a secure and sustainable battery materials supply chain for the US,"" Vikram Handa, Managing Director of EAM, said.

Graphite is a key component in EV batteries, but it often comes from foreign sources, some of which have weaker labor and environmental protections. It also helps alleviate concerns over tariffs disrupting supply chains, like China banning the export of the mineral to the U.S.

This partnership is excellent news for avoiding those issues, as well as keeping pace with the ever-expanding U.S. EV market. The demand for EVs is increasing, with the International Energy Agency reporting that more than 20% of new cars being sold are EVs.

EVs are becoming popular for a variety of reasons, one of the primary being financial. You can save up to $2,200 a year driving a fully electric vehicle, per the U.S. Department of Energy, because you're cutting down on fuel and maintenance costs.

The other benefit of EVs is their low environmental impact. EVs release no tailpipe emissions, meaning they aren't contributing to the planet-warming gases that pollute our atmosphere. And as the EPA notes, while charging your battery may increase pollution at the power plant level, it's still less of an impact than a traditional gas-powered vehicle. That impact can be lowered even further if you install solar panels at your home to charge your EV. You can check out EnergySage for vetted sources that provide accurate and fair prices on solar installations tailored to your needs.

Should America invest more in EV battery tech?

Absolutely 👍

The inventory was updated again by Lotus as part of the Rooted in Resilience plan.","A bike share program, incentives for carpooling, and increased public transit access are among recommendations made by the City of McCall’s first climate action plan.

The plan, called Rooted in Resilience, outlines strategies for the city to “reduce the community’s impact on the environment, build McCall’s ability to bounce back from disasters, and adapt to shifts in long-term weather patterns.” The plan was adopted by the McCall City Council on Oct. 24

“I’m excited about the whole thing,” McCall Mayor Bob Giles said.

Strategies in the plan are broken down into three categories, including transportation, which an analysis indicated accounts for 52% of McCall’s greenhouse gas emissions.

Greenhouse gas emissions refer to gases that make the Earth warmer by trapping heat in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane.

The most common source of greenhouse gas emissions is burning fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and heat, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Reducing transportation emissions

Short-term transportation strategies in the plan include prioritizing where and when to add bicycles lanes, pathways, and sidewalks. The city will also create parking incentives for people to use bicycles and other non-motorized transportation instead of vehicles.

The plan also recommends making sustainability projects eligible for funding from the city’s local option taxes, which currently raises more than $3 million per year.

Piloting a bicycle or e-bike share program and making electric vehicle charging more accessible to neighborhoods are two medium-term strategies identified in the plan, which does not define a specific timeline for “medium-term.”

The plan urges the city to help expand Mountain Community Transit, a public bus service that operates in McCall and includes routes to Donnelly, Cascade, and New Meadows.

A long-term goal for the city is for 50% of the local workforce to live within five miles of the city to reduce commuter miles, which in 2021 were estimated at nearly 350,000 miles per year for 64 city employees.

“Actually getting people out of vehicles entirely is a very big goal of this plan at this point,” City and Sustainability Planner Meredith Todd said.

Community health and resilience

The plan also includes 10 strategies for community health and resilience — the second of three focus areas the plan is divided into. Health and resilience strategies aim to reduce emissions from residential and commercial buildings, which combine to account for another 43% of the city’s emissions, according to the plan.

Strategies include establishing a Green Business Program, incentivizing energy efficient housing, creating a drought resilience plan, and expanded use of energy from wind, water, and solar.

A Green Business Program could include efficiency trainings for contractors, assistance programs for energy efficiency upgrades in buildings, and promotion of green business practices in McCall.

Wildfire resistant landscaping and design standards should also be created around McCall through wildfire risk overlay zones, according to the plan.

Destination management

The final focus area in the plan is destination management, which involves adopting a “holistic approach” to managing the city’s tourism economy.

The first strategy recommended by the plan is to create a destination management plan, a process the city council was briefed on earlier this year, as Valley Lookout reported.

Other strategies include adopting land management strategies that increase the ability of soil and plants to absorb and store carbon dioxide, a process known as carbon sequestration. Strategies for reducing pollutant-laden run-off could also be developed.

The city should also explore partnerships for public education to encourage eco-tourism and promote other strategies, the plan said.

The Rooted in Resilience plan was developed by Lotus Engineering and Sustainability, a Denver engineering firm hired by the city in 2024 to write the plan for about $94,000l

Strategies in the plan are informed by more than 2,000 survey respondents, four focus group sessions, and five community events held over the last two years.

The climate plan is a continuation of recent environmental efforts by the city over the last seven years.

In 2018, the city conducted a greenhouse gas inventory to determine local sources of greenhouse gases and estimated amounts contributed to the atmosphere per year.

A follow-up study in 2021 estimated that the city’s greenhouse gas emissions had increased by about 13% since the first study.

McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump's administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it's unlikely the 42 million Americans — about 1 in 8, most of them in poverty — will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries nearly that quickly.

The order was in response to a challenge from cities and nonprofits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit, a decision that would have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.

“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said in a ruling from the bench after a brief hearing. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”

McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.

Supreme Court lets Trump block transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.

The decision is Trump’s latest win on the court's emergency docket, and allows the administration to enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to correspond with their gender identity on new or renewed passports. The court’s three liberal justices dissented.

The high court has sided with the government in nearly two dozen short-term orders on a range of policies since the start of Trump's second term, including another case barring transgender people from serving in the military.

In a brief, unsigned order, the conservative-majority court said the policy isn't discriminatory. “Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth,” it said. “In both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.""

The court’s three liberal justices disagreed, saying in a dissent that those passports make transgender people vulnerable to “increased violence, harassment, and discrimination.”

Musk could become history's first trillionaire as Tesla shareholders approve giant pay package

NEW YORK (AP) — The world’s richest man was just handed a chance to become history’s first trillionaire.

Elon Musk won a shareholder vote on Thursday that would give the Tesla CEO stock worth $1 trillion if he hits certain performance targets over the next decade. The vote followed weeks of debate over his management record at the electric car maker and whether anyone deserved such unprecedented pay, drawing heated commentary from small investors to giant pension funds and even the pope.

In the end, more than 75% of voters approved the plan as shareholders gathered in Austin, Texas, for their annual meeting.

“Fantastic group of shareholders,"" Musk said after the final vote was tallied, adding “Hang on to your Tesla stock.”

The vote is a resounding victory for Musk showing investors still have faith in him as Tesla struggles with plunging sales, market share and profits in no small part due to Musk himself. Car buyers fled the company this year as he has ventured into politics both in the U.S. and Europe, and trafficked in conspiracy theories.

Nancy Pelosi won't seek reelection, ending her storied career in the US House

WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi will not seek reelection to the U.S. House, bringing to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.

Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco for nearly 40 years, announced her decision Thursday.

“I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said in a video address to voters.

Pelosi, appearing upbeat and forward-looking as images of her decades of accomplishments filled the frames, said she would finish out her final year in office. And she left those who sent her to Congress with a call to action to carry on the legacy of agenda-setting both in the U.S. and around the world.

“My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,” she said. “We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way.”

Kazakhstan will join the Abraham Accords with Israel in symbolic move to boost the Trump initiative

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kazakhstan is set to join the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab and Muslim majority countries in a symbolic move aimed at boosting the initiative that was a hallmark of President Donald Trump’s first administration.

The action, announced Thursday, is largely symbolic as Kazakhstan has had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1992 and is much farther geographically from Israel than the other Abraham Accord nations — Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.

Those countries agreed to normalize relations with Israel as a result of joining the accords, something Kazakhstan did shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The move was first confirmed to The Associated Press by three U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity to detail plans that hadn't yet been made public. Hours later, Trump posted on his social media site that he’d had “a great call between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of Israel, and President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, of Kazakhstan” and that Kazakhstan is the “first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many.”

Trump called Kazakhstan joining “a major step forward in building bridges across the World” and said “more Nations are lining up to embrace Peace and Prosperity through my Abraham Accords.”

Trump unveils deal to expand coverage and lower costs on obesity drugs

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for the popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

Known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, the drugs have soared in popularity in recent years, but patient access has been a consistent problem because of their cost — around $500 a month for higher doses — and insurance coverage has been spotty. More than 100 million American adults are obese, according to federal estimates.

Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved.

“(It) will save lives, improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” said Trump, in an Oval Office announcement in which he referred to GLP-1s as a “fat drug.”

Thursday's announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay.

A former teacher shot by student, 6, wins $10M jury verdict against ex-assistant principal

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — A jury in Virginia awarded $10 million Thursday to a former teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student, siding with her claims in a lawsuit that an ex-administrator ignored repeated warnings that the child had a gun.

The jury returned its decision against Ebony Parker, a former assistant principal at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.

Abby Zwerner was shot in January 2023 as she sat at a reading table in her first-grade classroom. She had sought $40 million against Parker in the lawsuit.

Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand. A bullet narrowly missed her heart and remains in her chest.

Zwerner did not address reporters outside the courthouse after the decision was announced. One of her attorneys, Diane Toscano, said the verdict sends a message that what happened at the school ""was wrong and is not going to be tolerated, that safety has to be the first concern at school. I think it’s a great message.”

There are more than 100 autoimmune diseases, and they mostly strike women. Here's what to know

Our immune system has a dark side: It’s supposed to fight off invaders to keep us healthy. But sometimes it turns traitor and attacks our own cells and tissues.

What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body – and tens of millions of people. While most common in women, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they’re on the rise.

New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.

“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.

Here are some things to know.

Cowboys' Marshawn Kneeland found dead of apparent suicide at 24 after evading officers, police say

Police in a Dallas suburb say 24-year-old Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland was found dead of an apparent suicide after evading authorities in his vehicle and fleeing the scene of an accident on foot.

Frisco police said Thursday they are investigating the suicide. They said Kneeland didn't stop for Texas Department of Public Safety troopers over a traffic violation in a chase that was joined by Frisco police on Wednesday night.

Authorities lost sight of the vehicle before locating it crashed minutes later. During the search after Kneeland fled the crash site on foot, officers said they received word that Kneeland might be suicidal.

As authorities were looking for Kneeland, a dispatcher told officers that people who knew him had received a group text from Kneeland “saying goodbye. They’re concerned for his welfare,” according to recordings from Broadcastify, which archives public safety radio feeds.

“We’re talking to the girlfriend. She’s trying to call his agent. But we’re trying to get her to call him first. But she’s saying he is armed and has a history of mental illness. And her quote was, ‘He will end it all,’” another dispatcher told officers.",,N,,2025-11-08 09:58:30.174187

Hydron Energy Inc. is lining up customers for its proprietary INTRUPTor, a machine that takes raw byproduct gases emitted from places like landfills, sewage plants and farms and upgrades them into renewable natural gas (RNG).

The process, developed by Hydron CEO Soheil Khiavi, uses “biomimicry,” making the machine work like a pair of lungs. Unlike existing technology to refine RNG, the INTRUPTor works at atmospheric conditions and without the need for high pressures or temperatures. It means the renewable natural gas can be upgraded at about half the capital and operating costs, delivering gas with 80 per cent lower emissions.

Earlier this year, the company concluded its first field test at a farm in Ontario.

“The results came back basically excellent. It was no problem. All the key performance metrics were met, some of them exceeded and we had a really good, happy customer. That turned into a purchase order for full-size plant,” Khiavi said.

Hydron has since signed agreements for other projects with FortisBC, Northwest Natural Gas in Oregon and the City of Chilliwack.

When it became clear that Hydron was going to go from a research and development firm to a manufacturer, the company began taking over 20,000 square feet space within their Lynn Creek area light industrial complex. Rooms that used to be ballet studios with mirrors still on the walls are now being used to assemble their patented tech. That has also meant staffing up.

“Currently we are about 20 people,"" Khiavi said. ""Our goal is to double up, so 40 people here by end of next year, and mostly on the manufacturing of our novel biomimicry, metalorganic framework, which is the secret sauce of the technology.”

Despite tariffs and setbacks in U.S. interest in decarbonization projects, Washington State and California’s governments are still going ahead with clean energy plans, Khiavi said. And Hydron is seeking out more markets in Europe and Asia.

Singapore and Thailand buy massive amounts of LNG at a premium from the Middle East to fuel their growing economies, but Khiavi said all of the gasses coming from their own biomass are being incinerated and emitted into the atmosphere with no benefit to anyone.

“If they actually use this technology, they can produce a big portion – up to 10 per cent of the gas that they need – just using their waste, at a price that is almost half of the import price of the LNG. It’s going to save them a lot of money,” he said.

Khiavi said the greatest potential for the technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally is in the “hard-to-abate” sector, and places in the world where other green sources of energy are not practical or available.

“We can actually cover a big portion of that,” he said. “10 to 12 per cent of the carbon emissions could be replaced…. The impact is huge.”

What’s more, Khiavi said, they are exploring other novel applications for the INTRUPTor’s biomimicry. In the lab, they are capturing small amounts of rare gases like xenon and krypton out of thin air. Aerospace customers need those gases for satellite propulsion, but there is a shortage in the market because the primary source for them in the world was a plant in Ukraine that was bombed by Russia early in the war.

And the same process captures planet-warming carbon dioxide and sequesters it while refining the rare gases.

“I’m quite excited. It’s a good result,” Khiavi said. “The dream I have is that we make British Columbia as a rare gas hub.”",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/nsnews/newsengin/2025/11/web1_nsn-20251031-hydron-energy.jpg;w=1000;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-11-08 08:18:24.762248

Since nonpoint pollution “cannot be easily measured,” Ecology-approved BMPs will ensure compliance with water-quality standards, according to the pollution-control plan.
The document also recommends riparian buffers at least 215-feet wide in Western Washington and 150-feet wide in Eastern Washington.
The pollution-control plan could be a way for Ecology to impose them, Washington Cattle Feeders Executive Director Jack Field said.
In comments sent to Ecology, the cattlemen’s association said the pollution-control plan bypasses the Legislature to set environmental and agricultural policy.","Washington farm groups are concerned the Department of Ecology will punish farmers and ranchers who decline to adopt large riparian buffers and other “best management practices.”

Ecology labels the practices, or “BMPs,” as “voluntary guidance.” But Ecology has drafted a pollution-control plan claiming the power to “require the implementation of best management practices.”

Farm groups are lobbying Ecology to clarify that the BMPs will be truly voluntary. They also want Ecology to pledge not to punish farmers who decline to adopt the department’s BMPs.

“Our concern is the BMPs will be voluntary, until they become mandatory,” Washington State Water Resources executive director John Stuhmiller said.

Ecology plans to submit the pollution-control plan to the Environmental Protection Agency by the end of the year. The plan will describe how Ecology will keep dirt and chemicals from running into waterways. Ecology periodically updates the plan to stay eligible for federal money.

Simultaneously, Ecology is taking public comments on BMPs for agriculture. Ecology developed the BMPs over several years. They purportedly are the best ways to prevent runoff, or “nonpoint,” pollution.

Since nonpoint pollution “cannot be easily measured,” Ecology-approved BMPs will ensure compliance with water-quality standards, according to the pollution-control plan.

Although called “voluntary,” the BMP document sometimes uses the word “must,” such as fences “must” keep livestock 25 feet from ditches.

The document also recommends riparian buffers at least 215-feet wide in Western Washington and 150-feet wide in Eastern Washington.

The Legislature rejected a bill requiring large buffers. The pollution-control plan could be a way for Ecology to impose them, Washington Cattle Feeders Executive Director Jack Field said.

“That could eliminate a lot of ground,” he said. “This plan is going to have an impact on anyone who has water on or adjacent to their property.”

Ecology’s plan holds out the possibility of penalizing “recalcitrant landowners” who don’t implement BMPs. The plan’s tone won’t encourage landowners to seek guidance from Ecology, Field said. “I don’t think the plan gives people that feeling.”

Ecology intends for the BMPs to help landowners comply with water-quality standards, department spokeswoman Colleen Keltz said in an email.

“Decisions about how to achieve compliance, about whether to implement recommended BMPs, and about which practices to choose remain in the hands of the producer,” she said.

“We recognize every property is unique and will continue to work on site-specific solutions as needed that reduce pollution and protect water quality,” Keltz said.

Ecology posts on its website a 2019 memo from the attorney general’s office stating it has the power to manage farmers who are polluting or have a “substantial potential” to pollute,

“Ecology’s authority includes the authority to require a nonpoint-source polluter to implement specific management measures,” the memo states.

Ranchers who do not adopt Ecology’s preferred practices could face penalties, the Washington Cattlemen’s Association warns.

In comments sent to Ecology, the cattlemen’s association said the pollution-control plan bypasses the Legislature to set environmental and agricultural policy.

“It imposes unproven, costly and often-impractical measures under the guise of ‘voluntary’ participation,’ ” the cattlemen said.

Tesla has never considered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and it has been just fine regardless.
Its customers have long begged and threatened the company to bring Apple CarPlay support, without success.
This is also the reason why GM decided against offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its electric vehicles.
This is exactly where Android Auto and Apple CarPlay shine brightly, as they work indefinitely for as long as the car still exists.","After GM announced abandoning Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the decision started a heated debate about the phone projection support. The carmaker argued that phone projection only provides limited functionalities, and a native solution is far superior. To be fair, GM is not the only carmaker that doesn't want Apple and Google trespassing on its turf. Others have refused to accommodate them from the get-go, even if this irked their customers.

Tesla has never considered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and it has been just fine regardless. Firstly, because it sold most of its vehicles to a strong base of die-hard fans, who were perfectly fine with anything Elon Musk chose for them. Secondly, Tesla's software is so good that nobody really misses phone projection apps. Rivian has followed a similar path, although for different reasons.

While Rivian's software is considered second-best after Tesla's, the EV startup is nowhere near Tesla's software experience. Its customers have long begged and threatened the company to bring Apple CarPlay support, without success. Rivian thinks that it will be able to match and even better phone projection apps with its in-dash infotainment solution.

Why are some carmakers refusing to offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?

The bet is not only on retaining customer data in-house, but also on selling lucrative subscriptions for functions that Apple and Google offer free of charge. This is also the reason why GM decided against offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its electric vehicles. More recently, the Detroit carmaker announced that it would also remove phone projection support from its combustion vehicles, enraging more owners. While carmakers want us to believe that their native infotainment systems are way better than using our phones, this also locks owners onto the maker of their vehicles. Strangely, GM was the one proving how bad this is for its customers, especially when the carmakers decide to pull the plug on certain features.

Case in point, GM just shut down its NGI app store, which allows installing apps in older (but not very old) Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC vehicles. The decision, which took effect September 30, turned the infotainment systems of millions of cars into dumb radios. Owners can still use the installed apps, but they are not supported anymore. If they decide to delete the app or reset the infotainment systems, they are gone for good, and attempts to reinstall them will fail.

Which GM vehicles are affected by the NGI app store shutdown?

Among the Chevrolet-branded affected models are the 2017-2018 Camaro and Silverado 1500, 2017-2019 Corvette, Cruze, Malibu, Silverado HD, Suburban, Tahoe, Volt, 2017-2020 Colorado and Impala, 2018-2019 Traverse and Trax, and 2019-2020 Equinox.

Buick adds 2017-2018 Verano, 2017-2020 Regal, 2017-2021 Encore, 2018-2019 Enclave, and 2019-2020 Envision to the list, while Cadillac has 2017-2019 ATS, CTS, XT5, XTS, as well as 2017-2020 CT6 and Escalade. GMC completes the list with the 2017-2018 Sierra 1500, 2017-2019 Acadia, Sierra HD, and Yukon, as well as the 2017-2020 Canyon.

As you can see, a lot of vehicle owners as new as MY2021 are left without software support and the possibility to reinstall or install new apps. This is not the first time it has happened, and likely won't be the last. We've seen it recently when the 3G networks across the globe shut down, leaving many vehicles without internet connectivity.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support is an underrated feature

This shows that relying on a carmaker to provide the right infotainment features is futile. GM is eager to sell you a new car with Android Automotive rather than supporting its old models. Not only because it makes money from selling cars (partly), but also because supporting old software is cumbersome. GM is focusing on current software platforms, leaving older hardware behind. It also shows that even modern infotainment systems have a much shorter lifespan than a typical vehicle. People tend to keep their cars for at least five years, and even after that, they are not scrapped but start a new life as used vehicles. It's not unusual to see people riding in 15-year-old cars or older, especially when they are well-maintained.

In this case, we're talking about much newer vehicles that are still far from their projected end of life. Can you imagine paying $100k on a 2020 Escalade and not being able to use apps on it after only five years?

This is exactly where Android Auto and Apple CarPlay shine brightly, as they work indefinitely for as long as the car still exists. You might upgrade your phone every two years, but your vehicle would still allow you to use the same familiar interface. It's a different story with locked-down infotainment systems, which a carmaker can deprecate at any time to force you to buy a new one.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gm-kills-infotainment-apps-in-millions-of-vehicles-proving-carplay-support-is-crucial-260524_1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 07:17:31.903064

The synergies between domestic policies and global climate ambition are crucial.
The Paris Agreement, secured 10 years ago, led to a crucial acceleration in clean energy deployment around the world and cuts in heat-trapping emissions.
Being at COP is a fresh reminder that alleviating global poverty and improving people’s lives is directly and intrinsically connected to addressing climate change.
Unchecked climate change will set back human development and already is in some places suffering from drought, extreme heat, intensified storms, and threats to water and food security.","I’m here in Belém, Brazil for the annual UN Climate talks (COP 30) set to get underway on November 10 in the shadow of a sobering United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report confirming the world will breach the 1.5ºC mark. Before we plunge into hectic agenda fights and intense negotiations over bracketed text in draft agreements, it’s worth remembering what these talks are ultimately about. They’re about decisions made by world leaders that are deeply consequential for everyone’s health and prosperity, and that will determine the kind of world we leave for future generations.

Many of the issues are perennial, and they will surface in specific ways at this COP—billed as an ‘implementation’ COP meant to focus on climate actions that need to be taken now not just vague promises of future commitments.

In a previous blogpost, I highlighted some things to watch at this COP, including how countries plan to step up ambition on their emissions reduction commitments, aka nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and the need to simultaneously advance adaptation measures. I also called attention to whether trust can be rebuilt over richer nations’ grossly insufficient climate finance for lower income countries. Of course, the influence of fossil fuel interests that swarm COP is a major threat to ambitious outcomes here.

At the heart of global climate agreements is the recognition that we cannot solve this problem solely as individual countries, regardless of how big or small, but we can succeed if we tackle it together by each doing our fair part.

Synergies between global and domestic climate action

COP can feel remote and arcane, but what’s agreed to here can boost clean energy and climate efforts at home—and what countries do through domestic policies and investments significantly affects the level of ambition at COP. At COP and at home, those actions must include efforts to expand access to cheap, clean, renewable electricity while phasing out polluting fossil fuels; opportunities to protect communities from climate impacts already baked in; and signals to decision makers across the global economy about aligning innovation and investments with climate and human development goals.

Acting together by boosting renewable energy and transitioning away from fossil fuels, we can bend the global emissions curve meaningfully and limit the rise in global average temperatures. At the same time, the emissions building up in the atmosphere come primarily from richer nations—although other major emitters like China are playing a growing role—and are unleashing costly and deadly impacts around the world already. Therefore, every country must also invest in protecting its people, economy and critical ecosystems from these worsening impacts, and richer nations have a responsibility to pay toward those efforts in lower-income nations.

The synergies between domestic policies and global climate ambition are crucial. When they work well, we get a multiplication of collective efforts. The Paris Agreement, secured 10 years ago, led to a crucial acceleration in clean energy deployment around the world and cuts in heat-trapping emissions.

Clean energy was already on the rise, and nations and businesses took the Paris Agreement as a guide to accelerate that momentum through domestic policies and investments. Collectively, that has helped bend the global emissions trajectory and reduce how much global average temperatures will rise over this century (albeit not by nearly enough as we are still on track to overshoot 1.5°C and even 2°C).

But when those synergies fray or break down, the impact can also be felt both at home and on the global stage. Right now, we are at one of those critical junctures, as the Trump administration tears up US clean energy policies and investments, disgracefully steps away from the Paris Agreement, and tries to undermine global climate action. At Belém, it will be crucial for the other 190+ nations to isolate the Trump administration in its deeply harmful actions and anti-science rhetoric and forge ahead to find an ambitious global consensus.

It’s in every nation’s self-interest to limit dangerous climate change and embrace the economic and public health benefits of a clean energy transition—and it’s in the global collective interest. The time for zero sum thinking and hiding behind other countries’ inaction is over as the planet teeters on the brink of overshooting 1.5°C of warming.

Why COP 30 Matters

COP is an opportunity to see the challenges in our daily lives mirrored in struggles around the world, and to seek common ground in addressing them in ways that prioritize regular people, not powerful political interests and the billionaire class. The massive global income inequities, that amplify the harms in the lowest income countries and communities, also come into focus here.

As I prepare for COP, I’ve been reflecting on how extreme climate-fueled disasters are now a harsh reality for so many people across the United States and the world. The people still reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton have something life-altering in common with people in Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba recently hit by Hurricane Melissa.

Also, the people in the Philippines who have just endured Typhoon Kalmeigi and other cyclones this year, on the heels of a record-breaking 2024 cyclone season. Small island nations face looming existential threats from sea level rise that will be familiar to people in coastal Louisiana.

No one chooses to be on the frontlines of these disasters they did not cause, and everyone deserves support in getting back on their feet and being better protected from the next storm, or wildfire, or flood. Meanwhile, the UNEP Adaptation Gap report points out the huge shortfall in current funding for adaptation in lower income nations. This is an issue that will be front and center at this COP.

I’ve also been thinking about how people at home in the United States are struggling to afford their electricity bills, even as the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress are decimating clean energy policies that would have helped drive down costs, and even as the costs of proliferating data centers are being passed on to all of us consumers.

Meanwhile, around the world millions of people don’t even have access to modern forms of energy and all too many depend on polluting fossil fuels that are taking a steep toll on their health. Massively ramping up renewable energy and energy efficiency (and the infrastructure to enable that)—solutions that are at our fingertips already and that are cheaper than fossil fuels in most cases—is unquestionably the commonsense path forward to tackling many of these challenges.

Being at COP is a fresh reminder that alleviating global poverty and improving people’s lives is directly and intrinsically connected to addressing climate change. Solutions to all these grave and pressing challenges can and should be aligned.

Misguided calls to pit these priorities against each other are puzzling, wrong and deeply harmful. Unchecked climate change will set back human development and already is in some places suffering from drought, extreme heat, intensified storms, and threats to water and food security. Investing in expanding access to renewable energy, drought-resistant crops, heat health protections for workers, universal healthcare, safe affordable housing, and a human rights-centered framework for people displaced by disasters are crucial both for people’s health and economic well-being, and for addressing worsening climate impacts.

Solving for problems simultaneously is the call of the hour, and it’s a no-brainer. What’s often standing in the way are entrenched interests who are making a lot of money off the current fossil fuel-based economy and are craven enough to weaponize the plight of people who live in poverty to keep the world chained to polluting fossil fuels.

Acting together is the antidote to delay, distractions and lies

Back in 1992, the world adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), here in Brazil, recognizing the science on climate change and the imperative to act together based on that science. It’s an almost miraculous global agreement that truly stands the test of time. Here is Article 2 from the UNFCCC, for example:

The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.

Despite the clarity and urgency of scientific reports from the IPCC and others in the decades since then, governments have not adopted strong enough policies and the fossil fuel industry still holds far too much sway over the world’s energy choices.

That we are at this sobering moment in the climate fight can be cause for gloom. I am here alongside many smart, committed people—including leaders from US states, cities and businesses, and climate justice advocates from around the world—because the fight still matters. It matters more than ever. We know the causes of climate change, we know the solutions to address it—now let’s get our political leaders to adopt them, using every beneficial tool at our disposal.

COP is by no means the only venue for this fight—although it is an important one, as it’s the only place where every country, no matter how big or small, has a voice. Everyone has a role and place where they can engage in this fight for our future.

Here in the US that could be in your public utility commission proceedings, in state legislatures, through efforts to push back against EPA’s rollback of the Endangerment Finding, or through investments your business makes. It could be through art that provokes and engages more people. It could be through campaigns to save precious forest and coastal ecosystems. And it’s tremendously uplifting to know that like-minded people around the world are also fighting where they can for these same goals and aspirations.

As ever, this is a fight we can only win by acting together, from our backyards to the world.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Antonio-Guterres-COP30.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:06:36.439419

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has launched an all-out assault against two of the most prominent sources of clean energy—wind and solar.

Trump has lambasted the technologies as the “scam of the century” while providing what critics describe as giveaways to the fossil fuel industry, increasing lease sales for drilling and mandating that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

His signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act significantly accelerated the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects, pulling back on commitments made under the Inflation Reduction Act several years prior.

Even renewable projects already in progress have suffered. Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind, two offshore wind projects in the Northeast that were under construction, received stop work orders from the Trump administration before ultimately being allowed to proceed.

Despite those headwinds, one pro-renewable group is offering something that’s been hard to come by lately: optimism.

“I really don’t think that this is a time for despair and withdrawal,” said Dan Stein, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Giving Green.

In a new report released on Wednesday, the research and grant-making organization highlighted what it sees as two opportunities to advance clean energy in a bipartisan fashion, even in an intensely polarized environment: commercializing what it describes as “clean firm power” technologies such as nuclear and geothermal, and addressing barriers to clean energy deployment such as federal permitting delays.

The report challenges concerns that clean energy is a lost cause under the Trump administration. Instead, the group’s strategy sees room to work directly with the administration on clean energy policy—rejecting the idea that advocates should shift their focus away from federal action in favor of an exclusive focus on state and local policies.

According to Giving Green, clean firm power refers to technologies that can produce emissions-free electricity on demand and over long periods of time. This differs from technologies like wind and solar, which don’t provide consistent energy throughout the day or across seasons.

Stein acknowledges that wind and solar play an important role in decarbonizing the energy grid since they are the cheapest and most technologically ready clean energy sources. However, he argues that the limitations of those technologies’ ability to provide consistent energy mean that they likely aren’t suitable to provide 100 percent of future electricity needs.

“You need to kind of bend over backwards the more and more you put solar and wind on the grid,” Stein said. “You need to make sure that you have big transmission lines to move energy around from the places where the wind is blowing, you need some batteries that will move power from day to night and even maybe from summer to winter.”

According to Armond Cohen, executive director and founder of Clean Air Task Force—which was awarded a two-year, $4 million grant by Giving Green on Wednesday—that means clean energy advocates need to start pressing for additional energy solutions.

“We can quibble over whether 80 percent of the problem can be solved with wind and solar or 50 percent, but I think there’s pretty much an emerging consensus that that is not 100 percent,” Cohen said.

To fill those gaps, Giving Green’s strategy aims to boost alternative technologies it believes could most benefit from philanthropic intervention.

The report highlights two technologies in particular—“next-gen” geothermal and nuclear fission—as top priorities due to their feasibility, scale and funding needs.

Those two technologies have been left largely unscathed by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy—and in some cases have even received its explicit support.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright included advanced nuclear and geothermal power in his first secretarial order as part of the department’s vision to “unleash American energy innovation.” And in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax credits for nuclear and commercial-scale geothermal projects were largely preserved even as those for wind and solar were drawn back.

For years, geothermal energy has largely been restricted to areas with significant volcanic or tectonic activity, with easily accessible heat, steam or hot water close to the Earth’s surface. Because of those limitations, large-scale geothermal projects have been geographically limited—found mainly in regions such as Iceland, New Zealand and the western United States.

However, technological advances in the oil and gas industry have opened up new opportunities for geothermal exploration.

According to Jamie Beard, founder and executive director of the geothermal nonprofit Project InnerSpace, hydraulic fracturing—which helped touch off the boom in U.S. natural gas along with horizontal drilling—can now be used to tap into the energy source in locations and at a scale that wasn’t previously possible.

Project InnerSpace, which has previously received funding from Giving Green and was just announced as a recipient of its next round of grants, is developing additional tools and technologies to tap into that new potential.

According to Beard, one of the largest barriers to geothermal development she heard from the private sector, governments and funders was an inability to know where they should drill. In response, Project InnerSpace developed GeoMap—which Beard describes as “Google Earth for geothermal.”

Unlike similar paid services that Beard says can sometimes cost millions of dollars, GeoMap is free. It allows stakeholders to utilize hundreds of layers of subsurface and surface data to analyze the expected cost of geothermal projects anywhere in the world.

“Funding entities are using it for diligence. Governments are using it to build policy. Every geothermal startup in the world uses it,” Beard says.

She thinks those advances—along with model projects the group has helped develop through its “GeoFund”—will help make geothermal energy an attractive investment even for companies that traditionally rely on fossil fuel extraction.

“How do you build a business model for geothermal that will actually attract the oil and gas industry? A business model where they will want to drill for geothermal, because it makes business sense for them to drill for geothermal?” Beard said.

“If we crack that code, you crack geothermal at scale globally.”

Some oil and gas companies have shown interest in the technology in recent years. Devon Energy invested $100 million into a Houston geothermal startup in early 2024, while BP and Chevron took part in a $40 million investment round for startup Eavor Technologies in 2021.

Still, there is likely some way to go before Beard’s vision comes to fruition. According to a 2024 report from the International Energy Agency, only about 15 percent of geothermal capacity is currently operated by oil and gas companies. And the industry has been slower to embrace geothermal compared to other clean energy investments, says the Journal of Petroleum Technology.

Next-generation nuclear fission, too, was highlighted by Green Giving’s report as a key opportunity to promote clean firm power.

Nuclear accounts for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. power supply, but building out additional capacity has been constrained by cost, Stein said.

Safety regulations put in place after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 have led to a much more complex and lengthy approval process for new nuclear projects, according to Stein. In addition, because these projects are significant undertakings, they face the same considerable regulatory hurdles that any major infrastructure project is required to undergo.

“The same reason it takes billions of dollars to build a subway in Manhattan is like the same reason it takes billions of dollars for [nuclear development],” Stein said.

But similar to geothermal energy, Giving Green sees recent technological advances in nuclear power as an opportunity to build new projects at greater speed and reduced costs than previously possible.

“The promise of these next-generation nuclear designs is that they can be more modular,” Stein said. “Learn how to build it, get it permitted, get it approved, learn how to build it really well, and then build it over and over and over.”

Giving Green’s report acknowledges the hurdles that will have to be cleared to achieve those goals. Advanced nuclear—like next-gen geothermal—is not yet a mature technology and will require sustained research, development and demonstration before it can move toward widespread and competitive deployment, the report says.

It also highlights risks about the viability of advanced nuclear, saying that the technological progress and political conditions that its future depends on are uncertain.

Beyond highlighting philanthropic opportunities to advance clean firm power, the report also says clean energy deployment of all forms, including wind and solar, need better regulatory processes—from accelerating federal permitting to modernizing the interconnection process.

Federal permitting reform, in particular, has received significant bipartisan attention in recent months—and support from industries across the energy sector.

One such legislative attempt, the SPEED Act, was introduced by Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and committee member Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine).

The bill would make significant changes to how the federal government conducts environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), considered the bedrock of environmental law.

Those changes would include limits on what projects would be subject to NEPA review and the scope of those reviews; raise the bar for courts to overturn the decisions of federal agencies overseeing those reviews; and establish a 150-day deadline to sue federal agencies over their permitting decisions—a drastic reduction from the current six-year statute of limitations for energy projects.

However, some Democrats and environmental groups have cast doubt on whether the benefits of any permitting reform bill, even a technology-neutral one, would be felt equally across the energy sector.

“I am personally deeply skeptical that we can negotiate in good faith right now to try to accelerate permitting of any kind, while there is an ongoing bad faith attack against solar and wind,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) said during a September hearing for the bill.

That sentiment was echoed by critics such as Marlyn Twitchell, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center.

“Given the administration’s war on renewable energy projects, this bill would do little but SPEED the climate crisis and the fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and oppressive heat that have already killed so many Americans and so severely damaged our homes, public lands, and economy,” Twitchell said in a September press release.

Stein acknowledged those fears but sees a way forward.

“I do share those concerns that the devil is really going to be in the details,” Stein said. “I think I’ve seen some senators say, ‘If there’s going to be permitting reform, we need some legal guarantee that the administration will not just cancel renewables projects.’ And I do think that that’s something that could be built into any legislation.”

To Stein, the promise of technological advances and bipartisan support for clean firm power, plus the potential to find compromise on deploying clean power more efficiently, leaves significant room for hope despite the political climate.

“I think that despite headwinds, there’s a lot that civil society can do at all levels,” Stein said. “It is a responsibility we have to try to bridge the gap and solve problems, rather than withdrawing to our specific camps or specific places where people agree with us.

“So I kind of want to be the voice for optimism here and say, ‘Look, it’s tough times, but we can still get things done—and this is a long-term fight.’”

Cohen, the head of Clean Air Task Force, agreed.

“Climate is a marathon, not a sprint,” he said. “So this too shall pass.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2205280577-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 05:57:30.939024

The Trump administration's return to power has unleashed an ambitious offshore energy program that dwarfs previous federal leasing initiatives. Through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the administration has mandated 36 total lease sales spanning from 2025 through 2040, representing a dramatic expansion of U.S. offshore lease sales under Trump's administration compared to the Biden era's more restrictive approach.

This comprehensive leasing framework encompasses 30 separate auctions in the newly designated Gulf of America and 6 additional sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet region. The sheer volume of acreage being offered approximately 81 million acres across both regions establishes this as the largest offshore leasing initiative in modern American history.

The economic implications are substantial, with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) implementing the 12.5% minimum statutory royalty rate to encourage robust industry participation. This rate, representing the lowest permissible under federal law, signals the administration's commitment to attracting maximum investment while still generating significant federal revenues from these offshore resources.

Historical data reveals that previous administrations typically conducted between 1-3 offshore lease sales annually, making Trump's program of multiple sales per year through 2040 an unprecedented commitment to domestic energy production. The timeline begins aggressively, with the first major sale, Big Beautiful Gulf 1, scheduled for December 10, 2025, just weeks after the program's announcement.

Strategic Geographic Focus Areas

Gulf of Mexico: America's Premier Offshore Energy Hub

The Gulf of America, spanning approximately 160 million acres of outer continental shelf, represents the cornerstone of Trump's offshore strategy. The inaugural Big Beautiful Gulf 1 (BBG1) sale will offer 80 million acres for development, making it one of the largest single lease offerings in federal history.

Resource assessments indicate the Gulf contains extraordinary potential:

29.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil reserves

54.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources

Existing infrastructure supporting rapid development

Proven geological formations with high success rates

The Gulf's strategic advantages extend beyond raw resource potential. Decades of development have created a mature ecosystem of pipelines, refineries, and support infrastructure that can rapidly accommodate new production. Water depths range from shallow nearshore areas to ultra-deepwater regions exceeding 10,000 feet, offering opportunities for operators with varying technical capabilities and risk tolerances.

Environmental considerations have been carefully incorporated, with specific exclusions for the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary and previously withdrawn environmentally sensitive areas. The Eastern Gap region, extending beyond U.S. territorial waters, remains excluded to maintain clear jurisdictional boundaries.

Alaska's Cook Inlet: Northern Energy Frontier Development

Alaska's Cook Inlet represents a complementary northern component of the administration's strategy, with 1 million acres designated for the inaugural Big Beautiful Cook Inlet 1 (BBC1) sale scheduled for March 2026. This marks the beginning of a six-auction series extending through 2032.

Cook Inlet's operational environment presents unique considerations:

Seasonal ice conditions requiring specialised equipment

Limited existing infrastructure compared to the Gulf

Proximity to Anchorage providing logistical advantages

Harsh weather patterns affecting operational windows

The region's resource potential, while smaller in absolute terms than the Gulf, offers strategic advantages including reduced transportation costs to West Coast markets and potential integration with trans-Alaska pipeline infrastructure. Historical production from Cook Inlet has demonstrated the area's commercial viability, though previous leasing activity had been limited under recent administrations.

Economic Incentive Structure and Industry Participation

Royalty Framework Designed for Maximum Participation

The administration's decision to implement the 12.5% minimum statutory royalty rate across all lease sales represents a calculated strategy to maximise industry participation while ensuring federal revenue generation. This rate structure provides several key advantages:

Competitive Global Positioning: The 12.5% rate compares favourably with international offshore leasing terms, particularly when combined with the U.S.'s stable regulatory environment and existing infrastructure. Furthermore, trump finalises Gulf oil lease plans while Norway's offshore royalty rates typically range from 20-28%, and the UK North Sea imposes rates between 10-40% depending on field characteristics and production levels.

Investment Certainty: By establishing a consistent rate across all sales through 2040, the administration provides the long-term price certainty that major oil companies require for multi-billion dollar offshore development projects. These projects typically require 5-10 years from lease acquisition to first production, making predictable fiscal terms essential.

Revenue Sharing Structure: Federal law mandates that a portion of offshore lease revenues flow to coastal states through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act and similar programs. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama receive substantial annual payments that support coastal restoration and infrastructure projects.

The revenue potential is substantial. Historical Gulf of Mexico lease sales have generated between $100 million to $9.5 billion per sale, depending on oil prices, acreage offered, and industry confidence. With oil prices currently above $70 per barrel and strong industry demand for domestic production opportunities, the 36 planned sales could generate tens of billions in federal revenues over the program's duration.

Comparison with Previous Administration Approaches

Biden vs Trump: Contrasting Energy Philosophies

The contrast between the Trump and Biden approaches to offshore leasing reflects fundamentally different energy philosophies. The Biden administration, operating under Inflation Reduction Act constraints, conducted only three offshore lease sales during its tenure, emphasising environmental protection and climate considerations over production maximisation.

Key differences include:

Sale Frequency: Trump's 36 sales over 15 years averages 2.4 sales annually, compared to Biden's approach of approximately one sale per year. This represents more than a doubling of lease sale frequency.

Acreage Scope: While Biden-era sales typically offered 10-20 million acres per auction, Trump's BBG1 offering of 80 million acres demonstrates a commitment to maximum resource access. However, this expansion comes amid concerns about us economy tariffs that could impact global energy markets.

Regulatory Streamlining: The Trump administration has modified environmental review processes to reduce approval timelines while maintaining safety standards. Specific changes include expedited NEPA reviews and streamlined consultation requirements.

Climate Considerations: Biden's approach incorporated extensive climate impact assessments and prioritised renewable energy development on federal waters. Trump's framework focuses primarily on traditional oil and gas development with climate considerations limited to statutory requirements.

Historical Context of Federal Offshore Programs

U.S. offshore leasing began in the 1950s with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, establishing federal jurisdiction over offshore resources. Peak leasing activity historically occurred during energy crisis periods, including the 1970s oil embargos and the early 2000s price increases.

The current program's scale exceeds even these historical peaks. During the Reagan administration's peak offshore period (1983-1988), federal lease sales averaged 15-20 million acres annually. Trump's program proposes offering an average of more than 50 million acres annually, representing unprecedented resource access.

Environmental and Regulatory Framework

Protected Area Considerations and Exclusions

Despite its expansive scope, the Trump offshore program maintains important environmental safeguards through specific area exclusions and regulatory requirements. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, encompassing critical coral reef ecosystems, remains completely off-limits to development.

Additional environmental protections include:

Marine Protected Areas: Previously designated marine sanctuaries and protected zones maintain their protective status

Endangered Species Consultations: All lease areas require biological assessments and consultations with the National Marine Fisheries Service

Seasonal Restrictions: Certain areas face temporal drilling restrictions during marine mammal migration periods

Water Quality Standards: All operations must comply with Clean Water Act discharge requirements

The regulatory framework continues to require comprehensive environmental impact statements for major offshore projects, though the Trump administration has streamlined review timelines to reduce project delays. Industry operators must still demonstrate technical capability and financial responsibility to handle potential environmental incidents.

Industry Safety and Operational Standards

Offshore drilling operations remain subject to stringent federal safety requirements established following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident. These include:

Blowout Preventer Requirements: All drilling operations must utilise certified blowout prevention systems with regular testing and inspection protocols.

Well Control Standards: Operators must demonstrate well design integrity and maintain qualified personnel for all critical operations.

Spill Response Capabilities: Companies must maintain oil spill response plans and equipment positioning requirements based on operational location and scale.

Environmental Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of air and water quality around offshore installations remains mandatory.

Important Note: While the approval process has been streamlined, federal safety and environmental standards remain substantially unchanged from previous administrations, ensuring continued protection of marine ecosystems and operational safety.

Industry Sectors Positioned for Growth

Major Players and Market Opportunities

The expanded U.S. offshore lease sales under Trump's administration create substantial opportunities across multiple industry sectors. Integrated oil companies with established Gulf of Mexico operations are particularly well-positioned to capitalise on the increased acreage availability.

Primary Beneficiaries Include:

Major Integrated Companies: Organisations with existing deepwater expertise and infrastructure

Independent Offshore Specialists: Companies focused specifically on offshore development

Service Sector Providers: Drilling contractors, subsea equipment manufacturers, and support vessel operators

Technology Companies: Firms providing advanced drilling and production technologies

The service sector expansion opportunities are particularly significant. Increased drilling activity will drive demand for:

Offshore drilling rigs and specialised equipment

Subsea installation and maintenance services

Marine transportation and logistics support

Engineering and technical services

Supply chain implications extend far beyond the immediate offshore sector, creating opportunities for steel manufacturers, equipment suppliers, and coastal infrastructure developers. In addition, the newmont executive leads us energy council strategy demonstrates industry leadership coordination in this expanding sector.

Employment and Economic Multiplier Effects

Historical analysis of offshore development indicates substantial direct and indirect employment creation. Each major offshore project typically generates:

Direct Employment: 500-2,000 jobs during peak construction phases

Operational Employment: 100-500 permanent positions per major facility

Indirect Benefits: 3-5 additional jobs for each direct offshore position

Regional Economic Impact: Significant multiplier effects in coastal communities

Louisiana, Texas, and Alaska stand to benefit most significantly from increased offshore activity. These states possess existing workforce capabilities, educational institutions, and infrastructure to support expanded operations.

Long-Term Strategic Energy Implications

Energy Security and National Defense Considerations

The Trump administration's offshore expansion serves multiple strategic objectives beyond simple resource development. Increased domestic production enhances energy security by reducing dependence on potentially unstable international suppliers and creating buffer capacity during global supply disruptions.

Strategic Advantages Include:

Supply Chain Resilience: Reduced vulnerability to international supply interruptions

Price Stability: Increased domestic production capacity providing market stabilisation

Geopolitical Leverage: Enhanced U.S. position in international energy diplomacy

Export Capacity: Surplus production available for allied nation support

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve integration also benefits from increased domestic production, potentially allowing for reserve rebuilding during favourable market conditions while maintaining emergency response capabilities. Moreover, this expansion aligns with broader critical minerals energy transition initiatives.

Global Market Positioning and Competition

U.S. offshore expansion occurs within a complex global energy landscape where American producers compete with OPEC+ nations, other non-OPEC producers, and emerging renewable energy sources. The Trump program positions the U.S. as a potential swing producer capable of responding to global market conditions.

Competitive Factors Include:

Production Cost Advantages: Gulf of Mexico production costs often below $50 per barrel

Technology Leadership: Advanced U.S. drilling and production technologies

Infrastructure Maturity: Existing pipeline and refining capacity supporting rapid scaling

Regulatory Stability: Predictable operating environment compared to many international alternatives

Export implications are substantial, with increased production supporting expanded LNG and crude oil export capabilities to European and Asian markets seeking alternatives to traditional suppliers. Consequently, these developments must be viewed alongside australia resource energy exports challenges in the global context.

Technological Innovation and Future Development

Advanced Drilling and Production Capabilities

Modern offshore technology enables development of previously inaccessible resources while improving operational efficiency and environmental performance. Current technological capabilities include:

Deepwater Drilling Advances:

Extended reach drilling capabilities exceeding 40,000 feet

Automated drilling systems reducing human error risks

Real-time formation evaluation and decision-making

Enhanced well control systems preventing blowouts

Production Technology Evolution:

Subsea processing systems reducing surface infrastructure requirements

Enhanced oil recovery techniques maximising reservoir productivity

Digital twin technology optimising production operations

Predictive maintenance systems minimising operational disruptions

Environmental Technology Integration

The offshore sector increasingly incorporates environmental technologies that reduce operational impacts while maintaining economic viability:

Emission Reduction Systems: Advanced flare and vent capture technologies

Water Treatment Innovation: Improved produced water handling and discharge systems

Marine Life Protection: Acoustic monitoring and marine mammal protection systems

Decommissioning Technology: Advanced platform removal and seafloor restoration techniques

Carbon capture and storage potential in offshore settings represents a significant future opportunity, with depleted offshore reservoirs potentially serving as CO2 storage sites while maintaining ongoing production operations.

Development Timeline and Market Expectations

Near-Term Implementation Schedule (2025-2027)

The aggressive timeline established by the Trump administration requires rapid industry mobilisation and regulatory processing. Key near-term milestones include:

December 10, 2025: Big Beautiful Gulf 1 lease sale bid opening

March 2026: Big Beautiful Cook Inlet 1 lease sale

2025-2026: Initial exploration program planning and permitting

2026-2027: Seismic surveys and exploration drilling commencement

Successful bidders typically require 18-24 months for initial exploration activities, meaning first drilling results from the December 2025 sale could emerge by late 2027. High-potential discoveries would then require additional appraisal drilling and development planning.

Medium-Term Production Projections (2028-2035)

Realistic production timelines from new lease areas suggest meaningful output beginning in the early 2030s. Major offshore projects typically require:

Exploration Phase: 2-3 years for discovery and appraisal

Development Planning: 2-3 years for engineering and regulatory approval

Construction Phase: 3-4 years for platform installation and infrastructure

Production Ramp-up: 1-2 years to reach full production capacity

Based on these timelines, peak production from Trump's lease sales would likely occur during the 2035-2040 timeframe, potentially adding 1-3 million barrels per day to U.S. production capacity depending on discovery success rates and development decisions.

The fund drew $5.5 billion in pledges on the first day of the U.N. climate summit, as Norway and France joined Brazil and Indonesia in investing.","Belem, Brazil — Officials from countries most vulnerable to global warming offered searing dispatches of life on the front line of a warming planet Friday, as world leaders gathered on the edge of the Amazon rainforest for the annual United Nations climate talks.

Ahead of Monday's official kickoff, officials have sought to build support for initiatives to protect forests and to streamline carbon markets, which seek to reduce the emissions that drive warming. But the meetings also took time to hear impassioned testimony about the harms climate change is dealing around the world.

Haitian diplomat Smith Augustin, whose country was pummeled by Hurricane Melissa, appealed to wealthier countries that produce the greatest share of the world’s emissions to support Haiti in preparing for bigger storms. Developed countries pledged $300 billion to help poor nations cope with climate shocks at last year’s summit, but the money has yet to be distributed.

“The hurricanes and the heavy rain devastated my country,” said Augustin. “Developing countries, and especially the small island states, are the least responsible for climate change.""

Kithure Kindiki, Kenya’s vice president, said rescuers in his country are still searching for scores of people missing after a deadly landslide triggered by torrential rain sent muddy water crashing into villages last week.

“A previously once-in-a-century cycle of extreme droughts alternating with devastating floods continues to wipe out lives,” he said. “This has now become common.”

And Kalani Kaneko, the foreign minister of the Pacific Island nation of the Marshall Islands, said his country already is living a nightmare.

“All we have to do is look out our front doors to witness the impact of climate change,” he said. “Now the sea rises, the coral dies and the fish stock leaves our shores for cooler waters.”

Time running out

Officials warn that it has become almost impossible to keep global warming below the key Paris Agreement benchmark of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).

Last year was the hottest year on record. Scientists say that every fraction of a degree of atmospheric heating unleashes longer droughts, deadlier heat waves and more intense storms.

Hurricane Melissa has made that painfully clear, said Racquel Moses, director of the Caribbean Climate-Smart Accelerator, a coalition investing in climate resilience.

“It will be much, much harder to ignore the Caribbean, to talk around the issues that are absolutely real, because we just had this experience,” said Moses, who has family in Jamaica. “The very way that we live is dependent on these negotiations going according to plan.""

Reduced summit participation hangs over talks

World leaders who were not in the room on Friday were perhaps as important as those who were.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who calls climate change a hoax and prioritizes fossil fuels, boycotted the summit, leaving a hole that many other world powers sought to fill.

Although China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India also skipped the conference, the officials sent in their place used the podium to revive lagging enthusiasm about the global energy transition and assure the gathering that multilateralism was not dead just because the U.S. wished it so.

Praising his country's massive installations of wind and solar power, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang promised to “accelerate the green transition in all areas.” Although China is by far the world's biggest carbon emitter, Ding made clear it was still a leader in switching to cleaner forms of energy.

“China is a country that honors its commitments,” he said.

Indian diplomat Dinesh Bahata on Friday touted his country’s expansion of renewables to half of all energy capacity, portraying the Global South as bending toward the future of affordable, clean power while political calculations trapped wealthier nations in an outdated addiction to fossil fuels.

“While developing countries take decisive climate action,” he said, “developed countries fall short.”

Others criticized that imbalance, with Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chairman of the African Union Commission, questioning how developing nations were expected to decarbonize at a time when financial assistance for poor countries is faltering and the U.S., the world's biggest oil producer, is cashing in on heightened demand for hydrocarbons.

“We do not ask for charity, but for climate justice,” he said.

Maina Vakafua Talia, the environmental minister of the island nation of Tuvalu, at one point addressed Trump directly over the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. “Mr. President, this is a shameful disregard for the rest of the world,” he said.

The White House shot back that Trump “will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Progress on forest protections and carbon markets

Attendees said they made progress on two initiatives over the past two days: Financial incentives to support endangered forests and a shared global carbon market.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was working to win support for a signature new fund that would pay 74 developing countries to better preserve their rainforests.

The fund drew $5.5 billion in pledges on the first day of the U.N. climate summit, as Norway and France joined Brazil and Indonesia in investing. Germany said Friday it would make a “considerable” commitment. The scheme eventually seeks to leverage investments into $125 billion.

Finland's President Alexander Stubb hailed the fund as a model for how to drive climate solutions.

“What we might be seeing now, according to studies, is a turn of the tide on carbon dioxide emissions,” he told The Associated Press. “This is because of financing. This is because of innovation. … That’s why I think (the fund) is a good idea.”

Also on Friday, Brazil and the European Union announced that they were joining forces with China and several other countries to create a coalition aimed at uniting the world's different emission trading systems into a single global carbon market.

A shared carbon pricing framework would motivate countries and companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by allowing those that pollute less than their assigned emission caps to sell credits to counterparts that exceed theirs. It has long been notoriously difficult to get nations on the same page about emission limits and prices.

Indigenous people eye a spot at the table

Brazil has billed this summit in the Amazonian city of Belem as uniquely inclusive of Indigenous leaders who have long been sidelined from decision-making in past climate talks despite feeling the most adverse effects of global warming.

Lula's government, which includes Brazil's first-ever Indigenous Peoples' Ministry, expects over 3,000 Indigenous delegates to participate this month as both members of civil society and negotiators. For comparison, last year's summit in Azerbaijan drew just 170 Indigenous people.

“This time, world leaders are coming Belem, to the heart of the Amazon, closer to our homes, our rivers, our territories,"" said Olivia Bisa, leader of the Chapra nation in Peru. Although Indigenous people cannot represent tribal nations in the talks, Bisa and others will have a greater role as delegates negotiating on behalf of their nation-states.

“We need to be in the room, not right outside of it,"" she said.

Their protests have also shined a light on the contradictions of host Brazil promoting itself as a defender of the Amazon rainforest. Lula's recent approval of an oil drilling project at the mouth of the Amazon river has set off demonstrations and outrage.

On Friday, outside Belem in the wider state of Para, hundreds of Indigenous people scaled cargo boats on the strategic Tapajos River to denounce separate plans for a new railway that would slice through their lands.

“This is our message to the leaders of the world,” Marília Sena, a leader of the Tupinamba nation, told reporters. ""We want people to see us who have been here for centuries, caring for the forest and the river.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87144335007-ap-25310640937115.jpg?crop=5659,3184,x0,y294&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 12:06:45.142855

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India's ethanol, but that's beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP.","Bengaluru, India — India's push to blend ethanol with gasoline shows the benefits and challenges of the sustainable fuel efforts being showcased at global climate talks this week.

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world's most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, being showcased Friday at the COP30 climate summit, provides political support for expanding biofuels and relatively low-emission hydrogen-based fuels. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

India's rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India's northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

Mann said prices for sugarcane have also dropped this year. He said it’s good that the government is tackling climate change, but it should put farmers and their prices ahead of ethanol mandates.

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India's ethanol, but that's beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP. “With the push for E20 blends or even more, a lot more area has to be cultivated which in turn means it’ll be replacing other crops,” she said.

Balancing India's needs

Climate experts said biofuel production can have minimal environmental impact when it’s made from waste or inedible vegetation and processed in facilities that run on clean energy. But when crops are grown explicitly for biofuels, it has a higher carbon footprint because of the fertilizer and fuel involved.

India’s ethanol strategy is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions, cut oil imports and boost agriculture, said Purva Jain, an energy specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But she said a faster transition to infrastructure for electric vehicles might be better. A 2022 study by her organization found that installing solar power for EV charging can be a much more efficient land use than growing crops for biofuel.

However, ethanol producers have invested significant sums in manufacturing and need a steady, growing market for their product now, said CK Jain, president of the Grain Ethanol Manufacturers Association. He said India should increase the percentage of ethanol mixed with gas and encourage the sale of compatible vehicles.

“We need to have higher blending as soon as possible, otherwise the industry will go into deep financial trouble,” Jain said.

Other experts advocated for a middle ground.

A 10% blend of ethanol with gasoline, can be a “win-win” solution said Natarajan of CSTEP. She said that would allow for use of existing crops without putting too much pressure on increased cultivation.

Khare, the YouTube influencer, said keeping lower blends available would help older vehicles.

“The government can bring E20 or even up to E85 programs on top of that, that’s completely fine. But consumers need to be given the option,” he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87147200007-ap-25309752249366.jpg?crop=6499,3656,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 13:01:54.666017

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world’s most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, discussed Friday at the COP30 climate summit, aims to quadruple the use of sustainable fuels around the world by 2035. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

COP30 organizers said Friday that 19 countries have agreed to support the pledge.

“Commitments like this gain traction over time,” said Mauricio Lyrio, secretary for climate, energy and environment for Brazil’s foreign ministry. “Therefore, 19 endorsements so far are an excellent result. And the variety, above all, is a testament to the fact that we are on the right track and that the cause resonates throughout the world.”

India’s rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India’s northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 MWe of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output.
The Calvert Cliffs NPP is located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Lusby in Calvert County, Maryland.
Besides Calvert Cliffs, other Constellation power facilities in Maryland are the Conowingo Dam, the Perryman natural gas plant in Aberdeen, the Philadelphia Road oil plant in Baltimore and three wind farms in Western Maryland.
He said such an agreement could provide Constellation with the confidence to apply for a new 20-year licence for Calvert Cliffs.","Baltimore-based US power utility Constellation has announced a long-range proposal to invest in up to 5,800 MWe of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland. To meet the state’s near-term needs, Constellation submitted battery storage and gas generation proposals to the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) as part of a state programme to fast-track permits for large-scale energy projects. Longer term, the company has proposed a range of new and existing nuclear investments, including a plan to work with state leaders to explore building new NPPs in Maryland.

With respect to near-term projects, Constellation President & CEO Joe Dominguez, said: “Constellation hopes to be a thought partner as Governor Moore and other policymakers consider the state’s many choices.… We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want. Therefore, our plan presents natural gas generation as one of a number of options, with an explanation of the utility work that will be needed to secure this option.”

He added: “What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation…. Constellation has extended the lives of our wind assets for another 20 years, and we are working with willing customers to support the relicensing of the Calvert Cliffs clean nuclear plant.”

He said Constellation was “excited to work with Governor Moore, other state policymakers, and all Maryland stakeholders to investigate the development of new nuclear power in our state just as dozens of states across America are doing today”. He noted: “Importantly, all our investments have been and will be done without any cost to Maryland families and businesses. We are not now and never will be a monopoly that seeks guaranteed profits.”

The full plan starts with more than 1,500 megawatts of fast-track projects that could help address near-term needs, including up to 800 MWe of battery storage capacity and more than 700 MWe (six units) of existing gas-fired power generators that could be rapidly deployed in Maryland and later converted to operate on hydrogen fuel. Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 MWe of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.

Longer term, the company has proposed potential investments in up to 4,000 MWe of new and existing nuclear projects. These include:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Centre: Relicensing the state’s only NPP to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 MWe of generation that serves more than 1.3m homes. Without licence extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036. The two pressurised water reactors (PWRs) rated at 863 MWe and 855 MWe were commissioned in 1975 and 1977.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10%, or 190 MWe, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 MWe of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output.

In addition to investments in new generation, Constellation seeks the to make better use of the energy resources already available in the region by working with large businesses to lower their consumption during peak times, helping to free up capacity for new energy users, relieve strain on the grid and lower overall costs. Constellation plans to make these “demand response” programmes more impactful by using AI to create a 1,000 MWe “virtual power plant” on the regional grid.

The Calvert Cliffs NPP is located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Lusby in Calvert County, Maryland. It generates approximately 40% of Maryland’s total power and a significant majority (around 87%) of the state’s clean energy. In February 2009, Calvert Cliffs set a world record for PWRs by operating 692 days non-stop. In 2008, unit 2’s capacity factor was a world-record high of 101.37%.

Besides Calvert Cliffs, other Constellation power facilities in Maryland are the Conowingo Dam, the Perryman natural gas plant in Aberdeen, the Philadelphia Road oil plant in Baltimore and three wind farms in Western Maryland.

Previous efforts to build a third reactor at Calvert Cliffs came to nothing. Constructing a new, large-scale reactor would take “maybe 10 years from start to finish” said Mason Emnett, Constellation’s Senior Vice President for Public Policy.

Emnett said adding a third nuclear reactor to Calvert Cliffs would probably cost around $10bn. A small modular reactor (SMR) might reduce this by several billion. Making technological upgrades, which could boost output by 10%, would probably cost around $1bn.

Constellation is looking to the companies that operate data centres, for support. Emnett said Constellation is in talks with large-load customers who could sponsor upgrades at Calvert Cliffs or other sites, in exchange for pulling power from those sites. He said such an agreement could provide Constellation with the confidence to apply for a new 20-year licence for Calvert Cliffs.

“We talk to customers about risk-sharing arrangements, but from the customer’s perspective, it’s difficult to bear a lot of that development risk when that’s not their expertise,” Emnett said. “They’re not power developers.” He suggested that state officials could take steps to back nuclear and encourage Constellation to keep operating the facility or grow its footprint.",https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/calvert-cliffs-30.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 09:19:14.218558

The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.
The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs.
“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.
States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Near the end of his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that aimed to reduce harmful, planet-warming pollutants emitted by refrigerators and air conditioners. The bipartisan measure brought environmentalists and major business groups into rare alignment on the contentious issue of climate change and won praise across the political spectrum.

Five years later, the second Trump administration is reversing course, as it moves to loosen a federal rule — based on the 2020 law — that requires grocery stores, air-conditioning companies and others to reduce powerful greenhouse gases used in cooling equipment.

The shift in approach has upended a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to quickly phase out domestic use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and are considered a major driver of global warming.

The proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency highlights the second Trump administration's drive to roll back regulations perceived as climate-friendly, even at the cost of causing disarray for the very business interests it is claiming to protect. The plan is among a series of sweeping environmental rollbacks that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said will put a “dagger through the heart of climate change religion.”

The HFC proposal will help “make American refrigerants affordable, safe and reliable again,” Zeldin said in a statement.

But environmentalists say the plan will exacerbate climate pollution while disrupting a years-long industry transition to new coolants as an alternative to HFCs.

With HFCs one of the main drivers of extreme heat and pollution, any delay in their phaseout “is going to be have negative outcomes and significant ones,” said Kiff Gallagher, executive director of the Global Heat Reduction Initiative, an international effort to reduce trapped heat that is warming the planet.

Industry groups supported the phaseout

The 2020 law signed by Trump, known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, phased out HFCs as part of an international agreement on ozone pollution. The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chemistry Council, the top lobbying group for the chemical industry, were among numerous business groups that supported the law and an international deal on pollutants, known as the Kigali Amendment, as wins for jobs and the environment. U.S. companies such as Chemours and Honeywell developed and produce the alternative refrigerants sold in the U.S. and around the world.

The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs. Zeldin said the Biden-era rule did not give companies enough time to comply and the rapid switch to other refrigerants had caused shortages and price hikes. Some in the industry dispute this.

In September, the EPA announced it is relaxing standards for cold storage warehouses and other cooling equipment and delaying other aspects of the HFC rule until 2032.

EPA now says the rule is bad for business

On a visit this summer to a refrigeration facility in swing-state Georgia alongside Vice President JD Vance, Zeldin said the administration was responding to grocery stores and refrigeration companies that have complained about the federal rule.

“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.

Zeldin said the so-called Technology Transitions Rule, finalized under former President Joe Biden, has been restricting access to refrigerants Americans need to cool their homes and businesses, while costs are going up and supply is going down. “It was costing more to be able to fix that system,"" Zeldin said.

Alta Refrigeration, along with grocery stores, the semiconductor industry and residents across America, were dissatisfied with the rule, he said, vowing to “fix this mistake.”

The Food Industry Association, which represents grocery stores and suppliers, applauded the EPA plan, saying the current rule “imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines.” Zeldin’s proposal “achieves the intended environmental benefits without placing unnecessary and costly burdens on the food industry,” said Leslie Sarasin, the group’s president and CEO.

Jorge Alvarez, co-founder of iGas USA, a Florida air conditioning company whose products include HFCs, said the Biden rule was “shoved down our throats” and threatened to create havoc. The delay “gives industry a chance to create new refrigerants, and we will,” he said.

The rule's rollback sparks confusion over Trump's strategy

But the change in tack comes after industry players had already made adjustments to ensure they could meet the goals set in motion by the 2020 law.

“Changing the schedule now would disrupt planning and inject uncertainty across the market,” said Samantha Slater, a senior vice president at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, which represents more than 330 HVAC manufacturers and commercial refrigeration companies.

Manufacturers have already retooled product lines and certified models based on the current timeline, she said, noting that nearly 90% of residential and light commercial air conditioning systems use substitute refrigerants.

A delay would give an advantage to foreign-based competitors that did not invest in alternative refrigerants and risks “higher costs for U.S. consumers,” Slater said.

Chemours, the Delaware-based chemical giant that is a leading producer of alternative refrigerants, said in a statement that it has “consistently supported an orderly phasedown schedule of HFCs as outlined in the AIM Act.''

Delays to the transition “risk undermining and stranding U.S. manufacturing and innovation investments, while also increasing uncertainty and supply chain inefficiencies, ultimately driving up consumer costs,'' said Joe Martinko, president of Chemours’ Thermal & Specialized Solutions business.

Even with the holdup, “the transition to low-global warming potential refrigerants is well underway,'' he said.

A temporary shortage this summer of cylinders used by HVAC contractors — which Zeldin and others have cited as a reason to delay the EPA rule — has been resolved, Martinko and other industry representatives said.

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the current rule ensures an efficient, affordable phasedown of harmful HFCs, while offering industry regulatory uniformity and a way to remain globally competitive.

He said the federal rule averts a previous patchwork of state laws and regulations. States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.

“Weakening the rule will confuse the market,'' he said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n5yYiOJz1hsj0gRFQTeFgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/9e485f020e41f955cea8d1385ab4cb74,N,,2025-11-08 10:18:08.893326

BYD possesses numerous advantages compared to other companies, allowing BYD to create electric vehicles that are less limited while designing and releasing the vehicles more quickly than many legacy carmakers. The growth it has achieved throughout the years has allowed it to compete with the American and Japanese automakers that have always dominated the technology side of the industry.

How the quiet giant learned to grow and conquer the world step by step

BYD has created a structured plan for what it intends to do, which includes developing high-value, yet affordable EVs utilizing the company’s exclusive technology and using this to penetrate the market, which is primarily dominated by established automakers. Its decision to enter Japan shows its intent to compete in complex markets with high barriers to entry.

How BYD is reinventing electric vehicles with cutting-edge technology

BYD is highly valued due to its innovation across the entire stack, beyond the motors and batteries it typically covers. With its Blade LFP batteries and purpose-built EV platforms, it can outperform competitors who retrofit ICE models, resulting in lighter, cheaper, longer-range vehicle production with quicker manufacturing periods.

BYD’s upcoming ultra-compact “kei” EV vehicle series launch set for Japan is a further example of its ambition to offer an EV in both mainstream and niche markets that have been historically dominated by more entrenched market players, just like this unprecedented gasoline-free Japanese powertrain.

A clear example is BYD’s “Racco,” a dedicated electric vehicle for Japan’s stringent kei-car classification. While having a range of approximately 112 miles and certified for 100 kW fast charging, Racco applies superior EV quality to small or compact vehicles. The Racco was explicitly designed for Japan and shows that BYD is not entering the category too late.

How a single move put the U.S. and Japan on alert in the global power game

BYD’s entry into the kei-car segment in Japan suggests that now every market is up for grabs. This threatens the share of the domestic market and illustrates the limits of domestic trade protections. BYD’s global scale and supply chains will allow it to minimize tariffs and redefine the competitive space to compel the U.S. and Japan to rethink potential policies, subsidies, and manufacturing on the pages of EVs.

For American and Japanese manufacturers, the invitation is not optional: act quickly to invest in EVs, gain control of battery and software development, optimize your manufacturing and supply chains, and engage consumers in a value conversation, not just about your brand. Anything less and you may just find yourself sitting back watching an industry disruptor, such as this, take your market share, determine pricing, and establish technology standards.

The emergence shows that in the automotive space, leadership is no longer assured by being an incumbent. By utilizing technology, scale, and speed, BYD is rewriting the rules of engagement, compelling legacy vehicle manufacturers to adapt or else risk being eclipsed in an industry driven by perishable speed that sacrifices tradition in favor of speed, just like this groundbreaking innovation, connecting 100 cities.

Unfortunately for Ford, sales never quite took off in the way it was hoping, and there's a good chance many of those Q3 sales were motivated by Republicans' decision to end the federal EV tax credit.
It doesn't sound like Ford's executives have officially made the decision to kill off their electric truck, but per the WSJ's report, they're seriously considering it.
That's partly because Ford made sure it had the capacity to build as many as 150,000 F-150 Lightnings per year, easily more than three times the actual demand.
That truck, however, isn't expected to go on sale until sometime in 2027, so if Ford did decide to kill off the F-150 Lightning, it would be a while before its new, smaller alternative hit dealer lots.","It's been a little more than three years since Ford officially revealed the F-150 Lightning, the fully electric version of its popular full-size pickup truck, and in that time, Ford's seen sales steadily tick up. In Q3 this year, Lightning sales were even up nearly 40%. Unfortunately for Ford, sales never quite took off in the way it was hoping, and there's a good chance many of those Q3 sales were motivated by Republicans' decision to end the federal EV tax credit. And according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal, it may soon be lights out for the Lightning.

It doesn't sound like Ford's executives have officially made the decision to kill off their electric truck, but per the WSJ's report, they're seriously considering it. On the one hand, it cost them a lot of money to develop, and year-over-year sales have been increasing, but on the other hand, it's only on track to sell about 30,000 Lightnings this year, which isn't very many when you're Ford, and you expect to sell more than 750,000 F-Series pickups this year. It also doesn't help that the least-expensive Lightning you can buy now starts at about $55,000, which is a lot more than the roughly $40,000 base price we were originally promised.

Now that Republicans have gotten rid of the federal tax credit, the effective cost of buying a new F-150 Lightning is even higher than it was back in September, which isn't great news at a time when Republican economic policies are also making everything more expensive. As Adam Kraushaar, owner of the Lester Glenn Auto Group, told the WSJ, ""The demand is just not there. We don't order a lot of them because we don't sell them.""

On top of that, it also didn't help that a recent fire at a supplier's factory caused an aluminum shortage that forced Ford to temporarily pause Lightning production, and we also know Ford has delayed the next-generation F-150 for at least a year, as it attempts to figure out the best way forward.

All told, Ford has reportedly lost about $13 billion on EVs since 2023, which, even in the business world, is a lot of money. That's partly because Ford made sure it had the capacity to build as many as 150,000 F-150 Lightnings per year, easily more than three times the actual demand. If Ford had been able to convert initial interest — it allegedly received more than 200,000 reservations for the Lightning — into higher sales, the massive investment in EVs may have been worth it, but that's just not what happened.

As Ford admitted recently, the kinds of customers who are interested in EVs tend to be more interested in smaller, less expensive options. But while some of its competitors appear to be giving up on all things electric, even if Ford does kill off the F-150 Lightning, it's still working on new EVs that people might actually want (and be able to afford) to buy. Back in August, the Michigan-based automaker revealed that it had developed both a new EV platform, as well as a new production system that would allow it to build several new EVs more cheaply and might even allow it to compete with the Chinese automakers currently threatening to eat Ford's lunch.

While Ford says it plans to build several different EVs on its new platform, the first vehicle we'll see is a new truck. Except, instead of being big enough that you might think crushing children was part of the official design brief, it will be smaller and, perhaps most importantly, cheaper. According to Ford, its upcoming smaller electric truck will start at about $30,000 without any tax credits and offer as much passenger room as a Toyota RAV4, while also being just as quick as a four-cylinder Mustang.

That truck, however, isn't expected to go on sale until sometime in 2027, so if Ford did decide to kill off the F-150 Lightning, it would be a while before its new, smaller alternative hit dealer lots. Then again, if sales aren't high enough to justify continuing to build the Lightning, then maybe it's for the best, at least from Ford's perspective.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/ford-may-soon-kill-off-the-f-150-lightning-to-focus-on-smaller-cheaper-evs/l-intro-1762524465.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 05:18:24.595687

“By 2025, over 60% of American farm companies are projected to adopt advanced seeds for improved sustainability.”

Introduction: The Role of American Farm Companies in 2026

In 2026, the strength and stability of the American farm company network continue to secure the nation’s place as a leader in sustainable and innovative agriculture. As the world grapples with rising food demand, unpredictable climate change, and environmental concerns, American farm companies are increasingly taking pivotal actions. These companies—ranging from leading seed producers to livestock breeders, technology service providers, and renewable energy solution suppliers—form an ecosystem that not only sustains rural communities but also sets global standards in food security and environmental stewardship.

As we look toward 2026 and beyond, the merging of innovation with tradition is more evident than ever. American seed companies, livestock genetics innovators, farmland trusts, and wind energy firms are collaborating—directly and indirectly—to ensure farms are resilient, sustainable, and equipped to meet today’s and tomorrow’s challenges.

This article offers a comprehensive look at the American agri-sector’s 2026 trajectory, spotlighting the ongoing transformation driven by advanced technologies, resource management, renewable energy integration, and data-enabled services such as those offered by Farmonaut. We’ll dive into the current state and future direction of:

American farm company restructuring and innovation

The rise of advanced seed technologies from top American seed companies

Breakthroughs in American cow breed genetics and sustainable animal agriculture

The role of American farm land trust organizations in conservation

How energy—especially from wind turbines—is being harnessed for farm sustainability

Through this exploration, we’ll clarify how American agriculture continues to lead, adapt, and set examples for a sustainable future.

The Evolution of the American Farm Company

The concept of the American farm company has transformed dramatically over the last decade. Where once farming was seen as the dominion of multi-generational families managing traditional row crops or livestock, today’s American farm company is far more diverse, professionalized, and technologically advanced. Companies now range from independent crop producers and family-owned livestock operations to vertically integrated agribusinesses, precision farming technology firms, and corporate service providers.

In 2026, the backbone of American agriculture rests on these companies’ ability to identify, adapt to, and lead innovation—all while maintaining the integrity and tradition that are characteristic of rural communities and farmland values. This balancing act revolves around clear pillars:

Resilient and adaptive seed technologies

Genetically improved livestock breeds

Land and resource conservation practices

Integration of renewable energy sources

Data-driven monitoring and operational optimization

The ability to continue thriving in an increasingly complex ecosystem is a testament to the vital role these companies play in shaping the future of the American nation and global food systems.

Key Characteristics of Today’s Leading American Farm Companies

Deep commitment to sustainability and land management for economic, social, and environmental resilience.

Adoption of advanced genetics and biotechnology in both plant and animal operations to meet market and environmental demands.

Continued integration of renewable energy and digital monitoring for lower costs, increased productivity, and lower carbon footprints.

Establishment of partnerships with farmland trusts, advocacy organizations, and tech companies to address development pressures and climate change.

With this foundation, let’s explore the crucial components of this evolving agricultural ecosystem, starting with the science behind seeds.

American Seed Companies & The Seed Science Revolution

If American agriculture is an intricate machine, seeds are its gears. American seed companies are the force driving forward resilience and productivity by developing crop varieties that are high-yielding, resilient to climate stress, and less dependent on chemical inputs.

By 2026, the adoption of advanced seeds—especially for corn, soybeans, and wheat—is nearing universal levels, with estimates showing over 60% of all U.S. farmland planted with genetically improved and climate-adaptive seeds. Seed companies have utilized molecular breeding programs, gene editing, and biotechnology to:

Enhance drought and pest resistance while still prioritizing flavor, nutrition, and quality.

Enable farmers to maintain yields despite unpredictable weather conditions.

Reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, thus supporting farmland and ecosystem health.

Case in Point: Drought-Tolerant Corn & Soybeans

American seed companies at the forefront have successfully released lines of corn and soybeans capable of using less water and still delivering strong yields, even during extended dry periods. Developments like gene-edited traits for root optimization or enhanced photosynthetic efficiency are becoming common in commercial seed catalogues.

The result? Not only are farmers less vulnerable to less predictable weather and climate volatility, but the land itself is under less pressure to deliver, reducing stress on water tables and surrounding ecosystems.

For farmers wishing to maximize the efficiency and traceability of their crops, blockchain-based traceability tools—like those provided by Farmonaut—are now an important resource. These tools ensure that every step, from seed selection to harvest, is documented and traceable, increasing transparency, food safety, and alignment with evolving marketplace demands for responsibly grown food.

Today, American farm company strategies are incomplete without the inclusion of advanced genetics, transparency, and digital traceability across the agricultural value chain.

American Cow Breed Genetics: Transforming Livestock Sustainability

Alongside crop innovation, American cow breed genetics have advanced rapidly in the past few years, further reinforcing the nation’s ability to supply the world with high-quality beef and dairy products while simultaneously respecting the need for sustainable farming practices.

Breeds like Angus, Hereford, and Holstein have been selectively bred for trait optimization across disease resistance, feed efficiency, meat yield, and milk quality. Modern American farm companies involved in cattle breeding now use genomic tools and data analytics to:

Accelerate genetic improvements across entire herds;

Ensure herds are healthier and more productive;

Reduce environmental impact by selecting for traits like lower methane production and enhanced feed-to-milk or feed-to-meat ratios.

These advances directly benefit farmers economically but also respond to the consumer demand for higher animal welfare, traceability, and quality assurance in both beef and dairy supply chains. Blockchain-based traceability—supported by platforms such as Farmonaut—enables robust verification of genetic lineage and animal welfare credentials.

“Renewable energy use on US farms is expected to increase by 35% by 2026, boosting resilient agriculture practices.”

Focus on Breed Diversity and Resilience

In 2026, American farm companies are investing in multi-trait, multi-breed herds. This means not just relying on a single cow breed, but leveraging hybrid vigor and crossbreeding for further resilience. This strategy supports continued productivity regardless of shifting disease pressures, climate influences, or consumer trends.

The benefits of these breeding programs extend beyond productivity:

Reduced disease risk through genetic diversity

Improved land use via targeted feeding and rotational grazing systems

Economic viability through premiums for certified, traceable, and high-welfare animal products

Farmland Trusts & Land Conservation: Preserving the Backbone

As America’s rural populations fluctuate and urbanization continues, American farmland trusts play an increasingly vital role in protecting agricultural lands from being lost to infrastructure development and non-farm use. These trusts work directly with farmers, municipalities, and policy makers to:

Implement conservation easements that keep land available for farming in perpetuity;

Support sustainable land management practices including cover cropping, rotational grazing, and biodiversity enhancements;

Preserve soil health, water resources, and the overall ecosystem, ensuring farming can continue sustainably for future generations.

A key part of these efforts is their focus on the triple bottom line: productivity, environmental health, and rural economic sustainability. Increasingly, American farm companies and seed companies are partnering with or taking cues from these land trusts to align their management practices with conservation priorities.

In supporting and following recommendations from trusts, companies defend the long-term economic viability of American agriculture.

Renewable Energy Integration: American Wind Turbine Companies on the Farm

The integration of renewable energy into farming operations is one of the most exciting trends for 2026. American wind turbine companies now routinely design, install, and service wind energy systems—tailored for the unique demands of large farms, ranches, and rural communities.

Wind energy is especially attractive to farmers because it allows them to:

Reduce operational costs and reliance on grid-based fossil fuels

Generate new revenue by selling surplus energy back to utilities

Decrease their farm’s overall carbon footprint and meet increasingly strict environmental standards

The complex ecosystem that is the modern American farm company is further enhanced by renewable integration. Many farms—particularly in the Midwest, Great Plains, and parts of California and Texas—are already reporting substantial energy cost savings and long-term farm resilience due to on-site wind and solar systems.

For those managing large-scale or multiple farm locations, energy integration is made more seamless with digital monitoring tools—like the real-time monitoring and carbon footprint tracking solutions available from Farmonaut. These tools offer farmers the ability to measure, report, and improve their renewable energy performance and sustainability metrics.

As grid fragility and weather-driven power outages become more common in the U.S., integrating renewable energy is one of the single most important resilience strategies for American farm companies today.

We boast the third-highest production rate for marketed natural gas among the states, accounting for approximately 5% of the country’s total natural gas reserves.
This is why it’s imperative that Louisianans take note of the European Union adopting its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.
This includes affiliates, with no connection to the European Union whatsoever, that fall under the Directive’s rules if their parent company operates in an European Union market.
The consequences of this would reverberate throughout the energy economy and every sector connected to it in our state, putting jobs at risk.","Louisiana’s thriving energy economy is a testament to the state and federal regulatory environments that allow it to flourish, because both balance growth with ensuring that the highest safety and environmental standards are followed to the letter of the law.

This balance affords us both residential and industrial electricity rates that are significantly lower than national averages. Yet that is not enough for the European Union, which sought to impose statutes, signed an ocean away, on American businesses — including those in Louisiana. President Trump was right to sink these efforts.

It bears remembering that most of the restrictive energy policies that have been attempted in states like California and New York were inspired by European nations like Germany and the U.K, who learned the hard way by seeing their energy prices triple and their industries fall into decline as a result.

We know better in Louisiana because energy is more than just part of our economy — it’s a defining industry for our state. The United States led the world in natural gas exports last year, with Louisianans handling over 60% of it. We boast the third-highest production rate for marketed natural gas among the states, accounting for approximately 5% of the country’s total natural gas reserves. The energy industry employs thousands of families across the state while maintaining the highest environmental and labor standards.

This is why it’s imperative that Louisianans take note of the European Union adopting its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. These standards would present no concern if they were only seeking to regulate inside Europe; the issue is that the Directive is an unwelcome export of those rules to the rest of the world.

Under its language, any company with an annual revenue from the European Union market exceeding 450 million euros, or about $486 million, is affected. This includes affiliates, with no connection to the European Union whatsoever, that fall under the Directive’s rules if their parent company operates in an European Union market. This overreach imposes new red tape and exposes American businesses that employ thousands of Louisianans to additional liabilities dictated by Brussels.

If this sounds familiar, the United Nations recently garnered headlines because of its International Maritime Organization’s plan to pass a “net-zero framework” that would levy a de facto carbon tax of up to $12 billion annually. This too would fall on one of our great Louisiana industries — shipping — and on everyday Louisianans because it would raise the cost of all goods moving by ships, which The Wall Street Journal called “the ultimate in taxation without representation.”

We should recognize the International Maritime Organization plan and the European Union directive for what they truly are: an attempt by other governments to force their broad restrictions on labor and environmental governance on more competitive, more sustainable American companies. If they are to succeed, we could see American growth throttled to the same degree as the Europeans, which is something we cannot risk in today’s hypercompetitive global climate, particularly in energy markets.

The stakes for Louisiana couldn’t be higher, especially with the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. As one of America’s top exporters of liquefied natural gas and a provider of critical supply to Europe — which is reducing its own reliance on Russian gas — facing European mandates such as carbon neutrality and mandated “climate transition plans” risks undermining our role as a global energy leader. The consequences of this would reverberate throughout the energy economy and every sector connected to it in our state, putting jobs at risk.

We can’t afford to wait and see what the impact of these regulations will be. Just look at the difference in gross domestic product growth between the European Union and the U.S. over the last two decades or so. In that time, our economy grew nearly 90%. As for the European Union, it managed only 13.5% growth. As two international economic superpowers, that stark difference in growth can be primarily explained by the European Union’s onerous regulations.

While President Trump was right to punt these rules for a year at the International Maritime Organization, there’s a way to fix this once and for all, and legislation already stands on the House and Senate to block the European Union from this extraterritorial regulation. Knowing the stakes, I urge Louisiana’s House and Senate leaders to defend the freedom of America’s businesses from European regulations. Our families, workers and energy producers shouldn’t have their futures decided by foreign bureaucrats who have no business telling Louisiana how to work.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/af/6af6c1df-29c4-4b00-b513-23e7ffb27209/68dab86a2580a.image.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 08:59:01.475535

And now for your environmental reports:

The U.S. Department of Energy just closed on a nearly $1.6 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources for a fertilizer facility in West Terre Haute that would inject over 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface —and local residents are speaking out. This type of carbon sequestration, the process of capturing and storing emissions in tanks, is touted as a win for reducing carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Yet the pressurized CO2 stored in these underground tanks can escape leading to heavy metal contamination and potentially undrinkable water quality.

Wabash Valley Resources plans to use carbon capture and storage technology in its fertilizer production, one of the cheaper industries to take advantage of this process. Energy Secretary Chris Wright framed it as reducing America’s dependence on foreign fertilizer sources, saying the project relies on “American coal, American workers, and American innovation.”

Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson called the project “exceptionally dangerous and risky,” arguing that the extended Terre Haute community would be exposed to significant threats to their environment, health, and water should the tanks ever be compromised. He emphasized that this project will increase toxic emissions, CO2 emissions, and is a false solution to the issue of pollution. Yet the EPA issued permits early last year allowing Wabash Valley Resources to construct wells. In fact, in early August, the EPA found that the injection and monitoring wells would have “no significant impact” on the environment. Some supporters even argue that this development would economically benefit Hoosier farmers.

But this project highlights a fundamental question in climate policy: Is carbon capture a necessary means to reduce emissions, or is it a lifeline to fossil fuel companies who let polluters keep polluting while putting communities at risk? For residents near West Terre Haute, this is about their water, their land, and who gets to decide what happens in their backyards. With construction potentially beginning soon, this issue remains an active topic of concern.

As world leaders prepare to gather in Brazil next week for the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP 30, a chorus of voices are issuing an urgent call for “courageous action to protect God’s creation and people. “ Those voices are a collection of U.S. Catholic bishops and relief organizations are issuing an urgent call for meaningful commitments to climate change mitigation. The leaders are urging countries to invest in resiliency efforts, commit to bold mitigation that reduces harmful emissions, pledge recovery initiatives for vulnerable communities, and provide transparent climate finance including debt relief. This faith-based call for climate justice emphasizes that climate action surpasses environmental or even economic issues. Course-correcting climate change is an imperative that connects caring for the planet with caring for the world’s most vulnerable communities. As COP30 convenes in the Amazon, home to Earth’s largest rainforest, the question is whether world leaders will match moral urgency with concrete commitments.

New York continues to drive progress, becoming one of the first states to require that every public school student—from kindergarten through high school—learns climate science.

These climate science classes will cover what’s causing climate change, local and global impacts as well as conservation and solutions. These concepts can be taught as stand-alone courses or by weaving lessons into existing classes through an interdisciplinary approach. In the current school year, 561 districts enrolled more than 135,000 students in climate-related courses, but this new requirement sets lesson standards for everyone, no matter where you live or which school you attend.

This legislation joins similar policies in California, Connecticut, Illinois, and New Jersey. Across the country, this shift considers what students need to thrive as adults—not just traditional academics, but tools to understand and address the environmental challenges they’ll inherit.

The nonprofit organization Climate Central has stepped in to rescue a critical climate tracking tool that the federal government abandoned earlier this year—a NOAA database that’s been documenting the United States’ costliest weather disasters for over four decades.

During just the first six months of 2025, there have been 14 separate weather and climate disasters in the U.S., costing over $101 billion, with the Los Angeles wildfires in January becoming the costliest wildfire event on record at over $60 billion. The average number of these extreme events has surged from about three annually during the 1980s to 19 events per year over the last decade making data collection essential in order to inform preparedness and response plans. Senior climate scientist Adam Smith, who led the project under NOAA for 15 years, will now maintain the database at Climate Central.

This database serves as a tool that communities, researchers, and even insurance companies use to understand escalating climate risks and build resilience. In a time when extreme weather is becoming our new normal, having reliable data to inform our decisions has never been more critical.

Many federal tax incentives for energy-efficient home improvements — including appliance upgrades — are set to expire at the end of this year, meaning homeowners who don't act fast could miss out on thousands in savings.

The Inflation Reduction Act created a new wave of federal rebates and tax credits to help households switch to cleaner, more efficient electric appliances. But as Canary Media reported, many of these tax credits will sunset by late 2025, even though some rebate programs will continue.

That means the clock is ticking if you want to fully take advantage of everything available to you.

You could snag up to $840 in federal rebates for a new electric or induction stove. The U.S. Department of Energy's Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate Program covers new and replacement electric stoves, cooktops, ranges, and ovens — including induction models that are far safer and faster than gas.

Gas stoves release harmful methane and nitrogen dioxide, which can worsen indoor air quality and cause respiratory issues. Induction models are not only safer but also around three times more efficient than gas-based models, cooking your food even faster and saving you money on monthly energy bills.

For renters or anyone not quite ready for a kitchen overhaul, plug-in induction burners start at only around $50, offering a quick and affordable way to cook cleaner and safer in your home.

Homeowners can claim tax credits by filing IRS Form 5695 when submitting their 2025 taxes, and rebates are managed at the state or tribal level via the Department of Energy's Home Energy Rebates Portal.

Just make sure to act fast, as upgrading to an energy-efficient appliance now could mean hundreds in immediate savings and a more comfortable, pollution-free abode. With many of these federal tax credits approaching their expiration date, switching to an induction stove might just be one of the smartest, healthiest, and most cost-effective upgrades there is.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-11-08 07:00:16+00:00,the Guardian,Electric cars: could leasing a used EV help you afford one? - The Guardian,"Jasper Jolly, www.theguardian.com, jasper-jolly",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/nov/08/electric-cars-leasing-used-ev-secondhand,"“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker.
The Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV.
Salary sacrifice The best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whose employers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme.
Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.
Holding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them.","When Anthony Santos was looking for a car to replace his Audi Q3, a diesel SUV, he felt reluctant about making the switch to an electric car.

“I was considering it, but I probably wouldn’t have,” says Santos, a sales manager at RWinvest, a property investment company in Liverpool. But when he started looking at his options the ability to lease a used electric vehicle (EV) caught his eye.

A couple of years ago someone looking for their next car would have been hard pushed to find a used EV – let alone lease one – but that is changing fast.

There are now 1m EVs on British roads, and the cars bought by early adopters are hitting the secondhand market.

Generally speaking EVs have lost value more quickly than petrol or diesel cars, which is a big problem for the owners of leasing companies, rental businesses or corporate fleets. But the flipside for consumers is that it is possible to find a cheap leasing deal.

In the second quarter of 2025, the number of used car leases in the UK rose by 166%, compared with the same period a year ago, with electric cars driving the growth, according to the latest data available from the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), a lobby group.

“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker. From about 15% of sales in 2024, used EVs now make up nearly half its business.

At Octopus EV, which is part of the UK’s largest energy supplier, the number of used EV leases has doubled in the last year.

The picture is helped by fact that big players in the leasing market, including Lloyds Banking Group’s Lex Autolease, BNP Paribas’s Arval, and the independent group Zenith, have started now offer leases on used EVs.

With the average price tag of a new electric vehicle sitting at £50,000, putting them out of reach of many Britons, in the summer the government launched a subsidy scheme. But buying secondhand makes going electric even more affordable.

Santos discovered that he could lease a lightly used Mercedes-Benz EQA without paying anything upfront. His company offered a salary sacrifice option (more on that later) via the Electric Car Scheme, which meant he could pay £360 a month for a car that would usually cost £570.

“There was no deposit – the tax benefits really made sense,” Santos says. “That’s what made me move forward with it.”

How leasing works

People who lease their cars pay a monthly fee, typically for two or three years, avoiding the need to stump up tens of thousands of pounds upfront. As well as the car, costs such as road tax, breakdown assistance, service and maintenance are often included – but typically not things such as insurance.

Leasing a used EV is a lot cheaper than buying a new one, even for vehicles in good condition that are only two or three years old. That means more expensive models can be more affordable, making it easier for people on lower incomes to cut their carbon emissions.

The Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV. On a standard lease a new model costs about £567 a month, but that falls to £292 for a used model on salary sacrifice. Volkswagen’s ID.4 SUV similarly falls from £506 to £296 a month, a decrease of 42%.

However, not every cost will be picked up by the owner. Lessees will still have to pay damage outside fair wear and tear, and some also add an excess mileage charge. While 10p a mile may not sound like much, high-mileage drivers will have to consider whether they will face a big extra bill when they hand the car back.

Salary sacrifice

The best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whose employers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme. The key thing about salary sacrifice is that the cost is deducted from your pay before tax – lowering your tax bill. How much you save depends on your tax bracket: so lower-rate taxpayers save 20%, higher-rate taxpayers (salaries of £50,271 to £125,140) save 40%, and 45% above that.

Ian Hughes, the chief executive of the corporate and consumer business of Zenith Group, says salary sacrifice has been “a major foundation stone of the transition” to electric cars due to the tax advantages.

Many employers offer salary sacrifice – ranging from very small companies to household names such as HSBC, BT and Jet2, as well as a number of NHS trusts. There are usually no fees for the employee, but employers pay the scheme provider the equivalent of the tax saved from lower national insurance contributions.

Often the companies offering salary sacrifice impose conditions, such as a minimum contract length, or a gross basic salary above a certain threshold. People leasing will also have to go through a mandatory credit check, as well as affordability checks to make sure they can handle the monthly payments.

There are still options for someone whose employer does not offer a salary sacrifice scheme. Carwow’s “Leasey” leasing service, for example, offers used EVs. An electric 2022 Mini Cooper S with 17,400 miles on the clock would cost £256 a month. That is still significantly more than the £209 offer for those able to use an employer’s scheme, but well below the £310 a month (on top of a £3,000 upfront payment) for the equivalent new model bought from Mini directly.

Gary Comerford, a consultant who runs the EV Musings podcast for electric car drivers, says his experience of leasing a used EV is “very smooth” but adds that he would not say it is flawless. He could not do a test drive before committing via Car360, although he had the option to return with no questions asked within the week. He paid a deposit of £1,200 and pays £310 a month for a 2021 Polestar 2.

“As long as you can work within your budget it’s quite easy to get a lease,” Comerford says – although he adds that limiting tax benefits to salary sacrifice is unfair to self-employed people like him.

Some optional extras can be included with the car (and can benefit from salary sacrifice tax savings), such as car insurance, home chargers, and even electricity.

At the end of the term the choice is generally to either extend your lease or hand the car back, although some companies also offer the ability to buy the car outright. Note though: early returners will probably end up paying an early termination fee (although fees for salary sacrificers are usually waived if they leave they employer through resignation, redundancy or dismissal).

If it works for you, and you meet the conditions, used leases make it much easier to drive an EV, says Zenith’s Hughes. “The very, very exciting opportunity is it lowers the price of entry from an affordability perspective,” he says. Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.

Beating depreciation

Leasing companies are not offering deals out of the goodness of their hearts. Offering used EVs helps them cope with their least favourite word: depreciation. They bought a load of electric cars a couple of years ago, only for secondhand, or “residual” prices, to drop more than expected amid slower overall demand for EVs.

Leasing companies have a large supply of rapidly depreciating vehicles, says Toby Poston, the BVRLA chief executive. They do not want to sell at a steep loss, so leasing helps solve a problem.

Holding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them. The industry’s experience with thousands of electric cars is that there are far fewer breakdowns, compared with equivalent petrol or diesel cars, meaning they are less likely to face huge repair bills as the vehicles age.

Hughes expects Zenith’s cars to go through two or even three drivers over eight years before they sell it on – potentially meaning no residual loss whatsoever. (Contrary to one persistent anti-EV claim, meaningful battery degradation is “just not a thing” for the average car, he says. And most EVs come with eight-year manufacturer warranties on batteries, which means leased cars would be covered.)

Without costly breakdowns to worry about there is “less potential risk” so it easier to offer leases, Poston says. At the same time, there is “overproduction of cars across the world”, he adds. “The deals you can get now are stupendous.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8457473ebcf6edf59c0f4338b362d1484c63aab2/1480_0_5555_4444/master/5555.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a27e8e2ed0418e5b352baf50475b612",N,,2025-11-08 02:18:01.403592

Rising rates Oregon customers of monopoly electric utilities have also experienced higher-than-average rate hikes in recent years.
Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011.","In a rare departure from the norm, one of the three monopoly electric utilities operating in Oregon is asking state regulators for permission to lower rates for residential customers in 2026.

The reduction, though small at less than 1%, is the result of Idaho Power’s break with coal, according to recent filings with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission. The utility’s roughly 14,000 residential customers who live in eastern Oregon will likely save less than a dollar a month. Idaho Power’s request could be on the commission’s agenda in early December, according to Kandi Young, a commission spokesperson.

It’s the result of the company saving $1.3 million by ceasing operations of a coal-burning power plant in Nevada, and through lower regulatory costs since a Boardman coal plant it co-owned with Portland General Electric in eastern Oregon was fully decommissioned in recent years, the filings explain.

Idaho Power plans to end coal-burning operations at the last coal plant it owns, along with PacifiCorp, in Wyoming by 2030, and to convert the facility to burning natural gas. The company has a goal to reach a 100% “clean energy” portfolio for power by 2045, though for now that involves natural gas — almost entirely methane gas, a powerful heat-warming greenhouse gas.

“Idaho Power has a detailed resource planning process that continually seeks the least-cost, least-risk resources to serve our customers,” Jordan Rodriguez, a company spokesperson, said in an email.

The cost savings from ditching coal come as President Donald Trump and his administration fight to keep coal-burning power plants running past dates many utilities had set for decommissioning them.

Experts have found coal power is significantly more expensive than alternative energy sources. And because so many coal plants in the U.S. are more than 50 years old, reviving them will needlessly cost ratepayers more than they need to pay for power. Coal is also among the primary sources of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions globally, according to the International Energy Agency.

In October, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced a $625 million investment “to expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry,” which includes $350 million in funding to recommission or modernize existing coal-fired power plants. But in the last four years, more than 100 such plants have closed because they’re not cost-effective to operate anymore, according to researchers at the Ohio-based nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.

Electricity prices have risen across the U.S. in recent years — about 13% on average since 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration — in part due to the rise of massive new users like data centers, artificial intelligence processors and bitcoin mining, as well as growing electrification across sectors. But costs have gone up more steeply in several states that rely heavily on coal, including Kentucky and West Virginia. Electricity rates in West Virginia, where coal powers more than 80% of consumed electricity, are up nearly 25% since 2022.

Rising rates

Oregon customers of monopoly electric utilities have also experienced higher-than-average rate hikes in recent years.

Rates for residential customers of Pacific Power and Portland General Electric are up about 50% since 2020.

Officials from both companies blame rising inflation, building infrastructure for more clean energy generation and storage, increasing costs to buy power, higher insurance costs and new customer demand. Power demand from large industrial customers, such as new data centers, is up more than 34% in the last five years, while residential demand is up 5%.

“It’s not very common for a utility to request a decrease in rates, but it does happen occasionally,” said Charlotte Shuff, a spokesperson for the Citizens’ Utility Board, a watchdog group established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of utility consumers.

“What’s more common is a rate decrease after a utility requests an increase,” Shuff said.

Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011. It initially asked the state’s Public Utilities Commission for permission to raise rates 27%, but was ultimately allowed a 4% increase. The company recently asked Idaho regulators to allow it to raise rates 17% on Gem State customers in 2026 for infrastructure upgrades, new energy storage facilities and wildfire prevention.

In its latest request to Oregon’s Public Utilities Commission to lower rates for Oregonians, the company said despite its savings, it will need to spend more than $500,000 on wildfire prevention work in the state in the year ahead.",https://corvallisadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/020325_intermountain_power_plant_06_720.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 06:18:16.898337

On The July 28, 2025 episode Economist Christian Briggs joins News Today to break down President Trump’s historic $2 trillion trade deal with Europe, calling it the most consequential agreement yet.

At the time of the episode’s release, the landmark accord outlined $750 billion in American energy exports paired with $600 billion in foreign investment directed toward U.S. infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean energy projects. Briggs explains how this framework is designed to stimulate domestic production, reduce European dependency on Russian energy, and generate sustainable employment across multiple industries.

“I think it's going to be a trillion dollar win”, said Briggs. “Not just from the selling of the product, but from the direct investments over the next 3 to 5 years.”

Briggs details how the policy could add over 200,000 new high-wage jobs through expanded LNG terminal construction, transportation upgrades, and advanced manufacturing initiatives. The episode also addresses macroeconomic outcomes, including projected GDP growth, supply chain resilience, and strengthened U.S. leverage in global energy markets.

The discussion highlights how the deal’s structure enhances American competitiveness while reinforcing strategic independence from adversarial energy suppliers. Briggs characterizes the move as a calculated economic and geopolitical masterstroke that will bolster U.S. industrial strength and long-term prosperity.

Greenidge Generation and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation have reached a settlement regarding Greenidge’s Title V Air permit renewal application. The company, located in Dresden in Yates County, operates Bitcoin miners using “behind the meter” power from its gas-powered electric generating facility. Additional power generated at the facility is sold into the electric grid.

Under the terms of the agreement, the NYS DEC will issue a final Title V permit modification and renewal for the facility, after the appropriate public process.

Greenidge applied for a renewal of its five-year Title V air permit in 2021. The application was denied in 2022, with the DEC stating ""renewal of the Title V permit would be inconsistent with or would interfere with the attainment of the Statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits established in Article 75 of the Environmental Conservation Law (ECL)"" based on the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CPCLA), that went into effect in 2020.

In 2024, filed suit seeking to overturn the DEC’s denial of the air permit application. The settlement dictates Greenidge will discontinue its appeal.

Additionally as part of the settlement, the permit will require a 44% reduction in permitted emissions by 2030, exceeding the goals set by the CLCPA, and a 25% reduction in actual emissions in that same time frame. According to Greenidge Generation, the 25% condition marks the first of its kind in a Title V air permit renewal in New York State.

During these past four years, the company has been allowed to continue electric and cryptomining operations as the matter regarding the air permit renewal application was reviewed by the NYS DEC and courts.

The Greenidge facility has also been the subject of legal action by environmental agencies and organizations, alleging the facility’s operations violate the state’s CLCPA, and that discharges into Keuka Lake violate the Clean Water Act. All court rulings have ultimately been in favor of Greenidge.

The Dresden facility was purchased by Greenidge in 2016 and converted from a former coal-fired plant to a natural gas facility, beginning electricity production for the local grid in 2017. The company later added a behind-the-meter cryptocurrency datacenter that uses electricity produced at the site and, according to Greenidge, does not burden the local grid. The company said it has invested more than $100 million in the facility and now accounts for nearly 10% of Yates County’s local tax revenues.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/tiogapublishing.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/82/982cccd8-6e41-53f4-8fb3-0444b586b66a/690ed5b6a04c9.image.jpg?crop=1919%2C1009%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-08 07:59:12.098844

“It’s important to note that there are dozens of different incentives, each with its own characteristics.
Some of them require evaluating the returns they generate for the country, and that must be considered when deciding on cuts,” one source explained.
To achieve that goal, in addition to the 10% linear cut, Mr. Guimarães’s proposal suggests higher taxes on companies under the presumed profit regime.
Lawmakers also noted that the exact number of existing tax incentives in Brazil remains uncertain.","Congress is expected to introduce a proposal in the coming weeks for a gradual reduction of tax incentives, with phased cuts through the end of 2032, when the transition period of the tax reform ends. According to lawmakers involved in drafting the bill, the aim is to create a more structural measure rather than a simple “patch” to help the government meet its 2026 fiscal target.

Another point viewed skeptically in Congress is the government’s plan to implement a “linear” cut—that is, an equal reduction across all incentive programs, done in a single step. “It’s important to note that there are dozens of different incentives, each with its own characteristics. Some of them require evaluating the returns they generate for the country, and that must be considered when deciding on cuts,” one source explained.

There are currently three bills under discussion focusing on incentives. One, authored by Senator Esperidião Amin, addresses the periodic review of criteria for granting benefits and governance rules. Another, from the government’s leader in the Lower House, José Guimarães, proposes a 10% across-the-board cut in non-constitutional tax benefits and an increase in taxation under the presumed profit regime. The third, by Congressman Mauro Benevides, provides for a minimum 10% reduction in tax, financial, and credit incentives, but the government considers it ineffective because it does not specify how the cut would be implemented.

Mr. Benevides is reviewing the Guimarães bill in the Finance and Taxation Committee (CFT) and will later move to the Constitution and Justice Committee (CCJ). The proposals by Mr. Benevides and Mr. Amin have already been granted urgent status, allowing them to go directly to the floor. According to sources involved in the talks, the government’s preferred points will likely be incorporated into the bills already under consideration.

In an interview with Valor, Lower House Speaker Hugo Motta said there is a tendency to combine the texts. Recently, after a meeting with members of the economic team and Senate President Davi Alcolumbre, it was decided that Congressman Aguinaldo Ribeiro would serve as the rapporteur on the issue. He was already acting as rapporteur for Mr. Amin’s bill.

Mr. Motta proposed a “stair-step” cut to Finance Minister Fernando Haddad months ago during discussions on the decree that raised the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF) rates. However, the idea was not well received by the economic team because it would spread out the fiscal impact over time and not address the 2026 fiscal challenge—the year the government aims for a primary surplus of 0.25% of GDP. The Finance Ministry declined to comment.

To achieve that goal, in addition to the 10% linear cut, Mr. Guimarães’s proposal suggests higher taxes on companies under the presumed profit regime. However, the expectation is that the final report in the Lower House will not include this measure, given its high chance of rejection. “The political environment will also be crucial in this process. Only proposals with secured support will be brought to a vote,” the same source said.

Lawmakers also noted that the exact number of existing tax incentives in Brazil remains uncertain. The Federal Revenue Service estimates about R$600 billion annually in tax breaks, but the government has suggested the figure could be as high as R$800 billion. “We’re waiting for the Revenue Service to send us the correct figures so we can better plan potential cuts,” said one of those involved in the discussions.

Another common complaint about Speaker Motta is the frequent fiscal surprises. “We go to bed thinking about one proposal and wake up to another—a pay raise for the Judiciary, R$5 billion in extra defense spending outside the fiscal framework, and so on,” said an aide.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/O5l4QJxvQP8oR6eedG-RDdkmmTM=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/t/q/8HB7tUQgKwgDHjBp8tig/mauro-benevides.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 07:58:35.543431

But how is it enforceable?”Pima County Supervisor Matt Heinz told Arizona Luminaria about Beale’s commitments.
In June, the Pima County Board of Supervisors voted to sell county-owned land to Beale for the future development of a massive data center.
Right now, the only agreement in place is the land sale.” “This is a new project,” Pima County Supervisor Jen Allen told Arizona Luminara of the current plan for the data center.
“Let’s put pen to paper and get a contract, legally binding and enforceable, that the people of Pima county can rely on,” Heinz said.","Beale Infrastructure — the company behind the controversial Project Blue data center — announced Thursday it will match all of its local energy use with renewables and invest $15 million in education, workforce development and community programs. But with no signed agreements or details on how those commitments would be enforced, Pima County officials say the promises offer more publicity than protection.

“Beale’s commitment to pursue 100% renewable energy for its Pima County data center is a

significant additional investment and reflects the company’s dedication to sustainable

infrastructure development,” according to the Nov. 6 letter from the company. “To achieve this, Tucson Electric Power (TEP) will serve the data center through an energy supply agreement and Beale will seek to accelerate the development of new renewable energy resources for TEP’s grid that produce enough energy to match 100% of the data center’s energy consumption — at the data center’s cost.”

“I love that. It’s great. Fantastic. But how is it enforceable?”Pima County Supervisor Matt Heinz told Arizona Luminaria about Beale’s commitments.

A memo from County Administrator Jan Lesher echoed the concern about enforceability. “While Beale states in their letter that details will be captured in a future agreement instrument, at this time there is no specificity on how the Beale commitments would be incorporated into an appropriate form of enforceable agreement to ensure future compliance,” according to the memo.

Lesher also noted the lack of specific information throughout Beale’s memo, including how future new clean energy generation would be developed or paid for, the time frame, and the dollar amount of investment.

“As stated in their letter, Beale has decided to move forward with the project even though Pima

County has unresolved questions at this time,” Lesher’s memo said.

The memo noted that in September the county suggested to Beale various community investments, including “clean energy generation, workforce development, broadband infrastructure, transportation infrastructure and climate mitigation in the form of home weatherization.” Beale chose to focus on “clean energy generation and work development options.”

A group that formed in opposition to the project, No Desert Data Coalition, responded to Beale’s announcement the same day.

“Once again, Beale Infrastructure brings forward vague promises of investment in workforce development that would only serve their own extractive industry. All while failing to address the outstanding public health and environmental concerns that have been raised since the inception of this ill conceived project.”

The coalition warns the county against “getting fooled a second time” by Beale.

They add: “Our community wasn’t fooled by Beale’s initial propaganda, and we aren’t fooled by this latest round of green washing and empty labor promises.”

Heinz said that Beale is “under tremendous pressure” to close the land sale before the end of the year. In June, the Pima County Board of Supervisors voted to sell county-owned land to Beale for the future development of a massive data center. Initially, the sale depended on the City of Tucson annexing the land so they could supply water to be used to cool the servers.

Heinz voted for the project. The board voted 3-2 in favor, with supervisors Jen Allen and Andrés Cano voting against.

After strong public opposition against the data center, the city unanimously rejected the annexation, but then Beale decided to go forward with the project anyway, saying it would use air-cooling technology rather than water. The land sale hasn’t yet closed.

“They want to get this project going, I understand that,” Heinz said. “But my priority isn’t Beale or the labor unions, my priority is to make sure the county has an agreement in place that will hold everyone to their commitments. Right now, the only agreement in place is the land sale.”

“This is a new project,” Pima County Supervisor Jen Allen told Arizona Luminara of the current plan for the data center. “We need a new contract, and these things that they are putting out now need to show up in the contract. This is just them putting out a letter and getting some press and trying to frame themselves as doing good, but it needs to be integrated into a contract.”

Besides the promise to use renewable energy, Beale’s community investment initiative includes a “$5 million scholarship fund designed to support STEM education and trade school training in Pima County.”

Despite county supervisors repeatedly stating that there is no legal means to back out of their agreement to sell the land to Beale, community members have continued to voice their staunch opposition to the project, crowding into supervisors’ meetings and laying out the environmental harms the data center may herald.

At the Nov. 4 supervisors meeting, union members also made their position clear: they want the data center and the construction jobs it will bring, even if those jobs end once the build is complete.

As the standoff continues, Beale has now added community benefits to the package. And yet skepticism remains.

“If in four years, if things change with Beale, what can the county do to enforce any of that?” Heinz said, referring to their commitments.

“Let’s put pen to paper and get a contract, legally binding and enforceable, that the people of Pima county can rely on,” Heinz said.",https://azluminaria.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCF7364.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 09:18:55.439080

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a member of the U.S. Joint Economic Committee (JEC), released the following statement following a new report by JEC Democrats estimating that annual electricity costs for the average New Mexico household are increasing by approximately 8% this year under President Trump:

“When you work hard in America, that should mean something. At the very least, it should mean you don’t have to make tradeoffs between your health care, rent, and energy bills. I am fighting to bring costs down so this can be a reality. But President Trump’s war on affordable, American-made energy, his massive tariff-taxes, and his assault on health care are making things worse, not better.

“Every hardworking person in New Mexico deserves stability and financial security. Period. I’ll continue fighting to make that a reality for all families in our state.”

On the campaign trail and throughout his second term, President Trump repeatedly promised that he would slash electricity prices in half. However, according to new JEC projections, annual electricity costs for the average New Mexico household are increasing by approximately $90 this year, which is 8.1% higher from 2024 to 2025. JEC found that electric bills have increased in 47 states, with consumers in 10 states paying at least 10 percent more for electricity.

Heinrich’s Actions to Lower Utility Costs and Fight Against Trump’s War on Affordable, American-Made Energy

As Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Heinrich has been fighting to lower energy costs and fight against Trump’s war on affordable, American-made energy.

Last month, Heinrich delivered remarks on the Senate floor, blasting President Trump for waging a war on American-made energy — causing energy costs to skyrocket and killing good-paying jobs. Heinrich’s speech came shortly before Senate Republicans once again blocked legislation he has led with U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.), which would have terminated Trump's harmful executive order that is wreaking havoc on working families, raising electricity bills, killing high-quality jobs, and undermining American energy independence.

Heinrich also sent a letter demanding that U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought restore funding for 223 energy projects in Democrat-led states that were unlawfully canceled. The funding for these projects was approved and appropriated by Congress.

In September, Heinrich sent a letter to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright expressing serious concerns surrounding the DOE’s cancellation of two dozen clean energy projects. The cancellation of these projects comes as energy demand continues to grow and consumer electricity bills surge as a result of the Trump Administration’s attacks on clean energy across the country.

In August, Heinrich released fact sheets that outline how the Trump Administration’s actions and Republicans’ Big, Bad Bill raises utility costs for cash-strapped American families.

Heinrich also hosted a roundtable discussion on how many jobs the Trump Administration will kill and how much they will raise New Mexicans' utility bills as a result of Trump’s Big, Bad Bill.

In late July at an ENR hearing, Heinrich raised the alarm on the energy affordability crisis facing working families and cited irresponsible actions taken by the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans that will raise energy costs on working families — including the passage of their Big, Bad Bill.

In early July, Heinrich grilled several pending Trump Administration nominees on the President’s Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) budget request and Republicans’ Big, Bad Bill, which will raise costs on American families by gutting investments in energy efficiency and clean energy programs.

In June, Heinrich slammed the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright over the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 26) budget request for the Department of Energy, which guts funding for energy programs that ensure Americans have access to affordable, domestic sources of energy and support our research and energy leadership should be shared goals.

In May, Heinrich urged the Trump Administration to immediately reverse course on its plan to illegally and unilaterally terminate the ENERGY STAR program. The ENERGY STAR program saves the average American household $450 on utility bills each year simply by choosing ENERGY STAR certified products.

In late February, Heinrich led his colleagues in delivering remarks on the Senate floor ahead of forcing a vote to end President Trump’s war on affordable, American-made energy. Earlier that month, Heinrich and Kaine introduced legislation to terminate President Trump’s national energy emergency and hosted a press conference to call on their colleagues to support this bill.

Excellencies,

Friends,

Over three decade ago in Rio, humanity set a new course of global climate cooperation.

Ten years ago, in Paris, we took a major step forward.

Without that act of collective courage, we would still be heading for an impossible future of unchecked heating, of up to 5 degrees.

Because of it, the curve has bent below 3°C – still perilous, but proof that climate cooperation works.

The clean energy revolution is booming, though we need to ensure all countries can get fully on board.

Last year, two trillion dollars flowed into renewables – twice as much as fossil fuels.

Ninety per cent of new power capacity worldwide was renewable.

Our focus today – climate plans and climate finance – are the spark that can accelerate action, driving green growth and resilience for every nation.

Our analysis shows progress: not just in bending the emissions curve, but more credible, whole-of-economy plans; stronger links to adaptation, just transitions, and gender equality; closer alignment with the Global Stocktake and with real-world delivery.

And, we see major economies saying they will strive to do better.

Because nations that move fast will gain the greatest share of the clean-energy boom reshaping global growth.

I commend those who have submitted their plans – and urge those who haven’t to do so now.

Here in Belém, we must accelerate on all fronts. That means doubling down on international cooperation. Our not-so-secret weapon in the climate fight.

But we all know that plans without finance cannot reach their full potential.

Finance is the great accelerator.

The Baku to Belém Roadmap charts the path from $300 billion a year to $1.3 trillion by 2035 – and it must become reality.

This is shared interest, not charity – an investment in stability and prosperity.

Every dollar invested in climate solutions brings multiple dividends: jobs, cleaner air, better health, resilient global supply chains, stronger energy and food security.

To unlock that transformation, finance must be scaled up, sped up, and spread out – reaching every nation, fast, fair, and in full.

Friends, the Paris Agreement has proved that global cooperation is working to deliver progress, but still not fast enough.

Ten years on, we must prove it again – by making this extraordinary framework work faster and fairer, for everyone, everywhere.

History will not ask what we intended.

It will ask what we achieved.

Thank you.",https://unfccc.int/themes/custom/unfccc/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-08 05:18:20.480627

• Review the technical setup for FMTL here.

The new fund comes amid a revived focus on critical metals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements — commodities now considered as crucial to modern economies as oil once was. These materials lie at the heart of clean energy and advanced manufacturing supply chains, both of which have been under increasing strain from geopolitical and logistical challenges.

First Trust said the ETF is designed to track the Indxx Global Critical Metals Index, which identifies companies generating significant revenue from the mining or processing of those key materials. The benchmark includes developed and emerging market firms outside of Vietnam that are part of the Minerals Security Partnership, a coalition focused on securing reliable mineral supply chains.

The index has been designed to segment eligible companies into three broad themes reflective of their role in global industry: firms supplying sustainable energy metals used in projects including solar and wind power; those involved with next-generation mobility metals that are crucial for the manufacture of electric vehicle batteries; and producers of other metals necessary for high-technology industries, such as semiconductors, consumer electronics and LED lighting.

Together, these segments capture the backbone of the materials economy, driving both the clean energy transition and the digital revolution.

The launch comes at a moment when areas beyond the obvious clean energy plays are also gaining prominence, such as solar and wind ETFs, and toward the supply chain enablers behind them. By offering targeted exposure to metals producers and refiners, FMTL could serve as a backdoor play on the green transition and the tech hardware boom alike.

Executives at Indxx, the index provider, say that the partnership reflects the global pivot towards securing materials needed for the next wave of industrial and technological growth.

As countries double down on resource independence and investors chase the next structural growth theme, First Trust's new fund positions itself squarely at the intersection of energy security, electrification and innovation — a vein that's getting harder to ignore.

Ford paused F-150 Lightning production at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan in October 2025, officially citing the Novelis aluminum shortage. The company prioritized conventional F-150 and F-150 Hybrid production instead, revealing where profits truly lie. Ford COO Kumar Galhotra told media the company would restart Lightning production “at the right time” but declined to provide any timeline.

“F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3,” Ford spokesperson Ian Thibodeau said in a statement to CNBC. “Right now, we’re focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis. We have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center back up at the right time, but don’t have an exact date at this time.”

The carefully worded response notably avoids any commitment to the Lightning’s long-term future. Industry analysts interpreted the vague timeline as evidence Ford may never restart production.

Mounting Losses Drive Discontinuation Discussions

Ford’s Model E division has lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025, contributing to $13 billion in cumulative EV losses since 2023. The Lightning itself has consistently lost money on every unit sold despite starting at $54,780, with many models selling for upwards of $80,000.

The financial pain intensified immediately after the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. In October 2025—the first full month without the $7,500 incentive—Ford’s overall EV sales plummeted 24% year-over-year. Lightning sales specifically dropped 17% to roughly 1,500 units, according to the Detroit News.

Since launching in May 2022, Ford has sold fewer than 100,000 Lightning trucks total through October 2025. Sales this year through October reached only 24,577 units—essentially flat compared to 2024 despite the Lightning initially receiving over 200,000 non-binding reservations that failed to convert to actual purchases.

Industry-Wide Electric Pickup Struggles

The Lightning’s troubles reflect broader challenges across the electric pickup segment. Ram parent Stellantis canceled plans for a fully electric Ram 1500 earlier this year, instead moving forward with an extended-range EV that includes a gas engine to recharge the battery. The Wall Street Journal report also cited sources saying General Motors executives have discussed discontinuing some electric trucks.

Tesla’s stainless steel Cybertruck, which briefly outsold the Lightning in 2024, has seen sales plummet in recent months. EV startup Rivian Automotive cut jobs this year as production challenges mounted. Even after the Lightning reclaimed the top spot in Q1 2025 registrations with 7,913 units versus the Cybertruck’s 7,126, the entire segment remains niche and unprofitable.

David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, told reporters: “Given weak EV demand, the Lightning long in the tooth, the need for more ICE F-150 capacity to make up for the Novelis fire, and a new generation EV truck in the works, it’s not shocking to see the rumor.”

Tax Credit Expiration Reshapes EV Market

The elimination of federal EV incentives has fundamentally altered the economics for both buyers and manufacturers. Congress passed legislation in July 2025 terminating both the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs effective September 30. The credits had been a cornerstone of U.S. EV policy since 2008, helping offset the higher upfront costs of electric vehicles.

Without the tax credit, a $65,000 Lightning effectively costs buyers $72,500—a price point that makes gas-powered F-150s significantly more attractive to traditional truck buyers. The Lightning’s value proposition always rested on federal subsidies bridging the gap between electric and conventional pricing.

Industry analysts predict sustained sales declines as the post-incentive market reality sets in. Toyota, Honda, and other manufacturers have already adjusted EV production plans downward in response to weakening demand.

Next-Generation Plans In Question

Ford had been planning a second-generation electric pickup, internally nicknamed T3, for production at its BlueOval City plant in Tennessee starting in 2028. However, the potential Lightning cancellation raises questions about whether Ford will proceed with that investment given the massive losses from its current EV portfolio.

CEO Jim Farley recently warned that Chinese automakers could “put us all out of business” with their manufacturing capacity and cost advantages. The company’s struggles to make EVs profitably while competitors like Tesla generate healthy margins suggests Ford may need to fundamentally rethink its electrification strategy rather than simply launching new models.

Ford plans to hire 1,000 workers at factories in Michigan and Kentucky to boost conventional F-150 and Super Duty production by 50,000 vehicles in 2026—a clear signal about where the company sees sustainable profits in the truck market.

EVXL’s Take

The F-150 Lightning’s potential demise tells a story that goes far beyond one vehicle. This is about the consequences of building an EV strategy around expensive, low-volume flagship products subsidized by taxpayer dollars rather than developing genuinely competitive electric vehicles that can succeed on their own merits.

EVXL has been tracking this trajectory for months. Back in May 2025, the Lightning was still beating the Cybertruck in quarterly registrations—7,913 versus 7,126. That seeming victory masked the underlying reality: both trucks were struggling, and the Lightning was only “winning” in a market that barely existed.

When the Novelis fire hit in September, Ford’s response revealed everything. The company immediately prioritized aluminum for profitable gas-powered F-150s while the electric Lightning sat idle. That wasn’t a supply chain decision—it was a business reality check. The Model E division had already lost $1.4 billion in Q3 2025 alone, and Ford couldn’t justify feeding scarce materials into a money-losing product.

The September 30 tax credit expiration simply accelerated the inevitable. Without $7,500 in federal subsidies, the Lightning’s value proposition collapsed. A well-equipped Lightning at $70,000-$80,000 competes directly with gas F-150s that cost $40,000-$50,000 and offer better range, faster refueling, and the utility truck buyers actually need. The math never worked without taxpayer support.

Ford’s predicament illustrates the fundamental flaw in U.S. EV policy that prioritized compliance and political optics over genuine market development. The Inflation Reduction Act funneled billions into expensive EVs that couldn’t compete without subsidies, creating temporary demand that evaporated the moment incentives ended. Meanwhile, Chinese competitors like BYD spent the same years building genuinely affordable EVs with profitable business models.

The broader question is whether traditional automakers can transition to electric vehicles at all. GM is quietly discussing cuts to its electric truck lineup. Stellantis canceled the electric Ram. European manufacturers are retreating from aggressive EV commitments as losses mount. Even Tesla’s market share is slipping as competition intensifies.

Ford bet billions on electric F-Series trucks being its “Model T moment”—a revolutionary product that would transform transportation. Instead, the Lightning may become the industry’s cautionary tale about the perils of subsidized electrification strategies divorced from market realities. The next-generation T3 truck planned for 2028 now looks increasingly unlikely, and Ford’s entire EV strategy faces a reckoning.

The data center needs at least 2600 megawatts.
Meta’s data center will need roughly three times the amount of electricity that the city of New Orleans uses in a year and increase Entergy's electric needs in the state by around 30%.
The Treaty Oak solar farms are expected to break ground before the end of the year, said Chris Elrod, CEO of the Austin-based company.
The 185 MW solar farm in Morehouse Parish, expected to come online in 2027, is the third large-scale solar project in the rural northeast Louisiana parish.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has signed a deal with a developer for two large-scale solar farms in rural Louisiana, projects tied to the tech giant's construction of its largest data center yet in the state's northeast.

The 385-megawatt projects, with developer Treaty Oaks, will generate enough power for around 80,000 homes. Meta will purchase the solar energy generated at the two sites in Morehouse and Sabine Parishes.

The clean energy will flow directly to the region's grid, helping Meta offset a small portion of the emissions from the three gas-fired electricity plants being built for its $27 billion AI data center in Richland Parish. The data center needs at least 2600 megawatts.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's founder, said in July that he planned to expand the massive data center — originally planned to sit on land the size of 70 football fields — to a footprint rivaling Manhattan, though some have cast doubt on if that could be possible.

Meta’s data center will need roughly three times the amount of electricity that the city of New Orleans uses in a year and increase Entergy's electric needs in the state by around 30%. Future expansions could ratchet up these figures much higher.

“When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid – and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy while contributing to local energy resilience and economic growth across Louisiana,"" Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said in a statement.

Meta is also planning to bring an additional 1500 MW of renewable energy to the grid through its contract with Entergy, the state's largest utility. The agreement with Treaty Oak and another with a company for a solar farm in Ouachita Parish are separate from the Entergy process, said Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle.

The Treaty Oak solar farms are expected to break ground before the end of the year, said Chris Elrod, CEO of the Austin-based company. The ""Hollis Creek"" project in Sabine Parish will sit on 2,300 acres of former timberland, and the ""Beekman"" project in Morehouse Parish will sit on 1,600 acres.

Elrod said the company intentionally set out to develop in Louisiana because of growth in the state's digital infrastructure, such as data centers, and manufacturing industries.

""It's a major milestone for our company and we're looking forward frankly to doing a lot more in the state of Louisiana,"" Elrod said.

'Lost a lot of our tax base'

The solar developer entered into a 15-year agreement with Meta, the same length of time as the tech company's contract with Entergy. Treaty Oak has completed all of the permitting and authorizations needed in both parishes, Elrod said, as well as tax abatement agreements in the form of payment-in-lieu-of-taxes, or PILOTs.

The projects are expected to generate over $100 million in state and local tax revenue and bring 300 jobs during the height of construction, according to Treaty Oak. The developer also has Louisiana projects in Vernon and Rapides Parishes, Elrod said.

The 185 MW solar farm in Morehouse Parish, expected to come online in 2027, is the third large-scale solar project in the rural northeast Louisiana parish. Two other tech giants, Amazon and Microsoft, are already purchasing clean energy generated in Morehouse Parish, said Kay King, CEO of the parish's economic development corporation. She said she's thrilled to have Meta as a new partner in the parish, which borders Richland Parish.

King stressed that in recent decades Morehouse Parish has lost almost all of its major industries, leading to a depressed tax base. Some 30% of the population live below the poverty line, half of the children in the parish live below the poverty line and 63 percent of households experience financial hardship.

The clean energy projects bring additional tax revenue during the construction process, King said, and while they don't yield many permanent jobs, the improved grid indirectly leads to more opportunities. For instance, the companies bringing energy infrastructure ""practically have to build the roads,"" which are in poor condition, King said.

""We've lost a lot of our tax base here and that's as important as creating jobs,"" King said. ""You have to be able to provide people with the amenities they're looking for. You have to fix their potholes, you have to keep your roads up, you have to improve the schools.""

The solar developers also improved road conditions in Sabine Parish, in the western-central part of the state where the other new 200-megawatt farm will be located. Bill Weatherford, the secretary treasurer of the Sabine Parish Police Jury, said they were able to negotiate ""a very favorable agreement"" with Treaty Oak. The company has already spent around $1 million on road improvements, he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/21/221d11c8-6513-5af1-a0e4-d5074c5c8c85/6893bb6edd10b.image.jpg?crop=1801%2C946%2C0%2C102&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-07 23:18:09.983857

The purpose of the public hearing is to offer all interested persons an opportunity to comment on current preliminary design plans for the Intersection improvement project at U.S. 40 and C.R. 600 E in Hancock County, Indiana. Doors will open at 5:30 PM to view displays and meet the project team, followed by a presentation at 6:00 PM and an opportunity for public comment. The display area will remain open until 7:30 and project team members will be available to give any further explanations of materials. The project is needed to address the history of severe right-angle crashes and congestion at the intersection. From 2022 to 2024, 12 of the 15 reported crashes were right-angle collisions. Additionally, traffic volumes on the north and south approaches of C.R. 600 E. have exceeded the road’s capacity, leading to long delays and safety concerns. The purpose of the project is to reduce the number of right-angle crashes and reduce traffic congestion on C.R. 600 E. during peak travel times. As proposed, the project involves the construction of a reduced conflict intersection (RCI) by eliminating the cross-street left turns and introducing a two-stage crossing to reduce unsafe operations. Drivers from C.R. 600 East will be required to turn right onto U.S. 40 and use new U-turn loons (expanded paved areas opposite the median crossovers to provide additional space to facilitate the larger turning path of a commercial vehicle along narrow medians) located approximately 600 feet on either side of the intersection. Left turns from U.S. 40 will remain, but through movements from C.R. 600 E will be restricted by new concrete medians. The project will require approximately 1.40 acres of permanent right-of-way (ROW) and 0.12 acres of temporary ROW. Environmental impacts include approximately 0.021 acres of wetland impacts, 1.73 acres of terrestrial habitat impacts, and 0.09 acres of tree clearing. No stream impacts are anticipated. The maintenance of traffic (MOT) for the project will be implemented in phases. Temporary shoulder closures and traffic shifts will accommodate loon construction, U-turn construction, median construction, and CR 600 E approach construction. MOT details will be presented during the public hearing. Access to all properties will be maintained throughout construction. School corporations and emergency services will be notified of closures prior to construction. Work is anticipated to begin during the 2027 construction season. Federal and State funds are proposed to be used for construction of this project. The cost of the project, including engineering, ROW, and construction, is estimated at $3,973,418. INDOT and the Federal Highway Administration have agreed that this project poses minimal impact to natural environment.

The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time.","The world of car sales is entering a new era. There were hints of it last year, when the sales of hybrid vehicles began to explode, but now, thanks to that already-softening demand of EVs and now the lack of a federal tax credit to incentivize sales, it’s clearer than ever: EVs are on the downturn.

The proof lies in October sales, which were released earlier this week; the first round of real data shows just how important that federal incentive was. It revealed a drop of 43 percent year over year. The numbers are forcing automakers to consider whether building EVs is even worth their time. And the first casualty of that thought process could be one of the most important EVs of the 2020s: the F-150 Lightning.

What else is going on in the world? Tesla CEO Elon Musk finally got approval for his controversial $900 billion pay package, winning more than three-quarters of shareholder votes. Whether he’ll actually perform well enough to earn enough to make him the world’s first trillionaire remains to be seen, though it seems unlikely.

Then there’s Toyota, which is building V6s that grenade themselves. The company has recalled another 127,000 engines for “machining debris” that could cause total failure. Oh, and Tesla has delayed the Roadster again, this time to April Fools’ Day, 2026. Let’s get into it.

Ford Reportedly Might Not Bother With Resuscitating F-150 Lightning Production

Back in September, an aluminum plant in Oswego, New York suffered a big fire that reportedly “leveled” a key part of its facility, according to the Wall Street Journal. This plant supplied aluminum to several automakers producing cars in the U.S., with Ford reportedly being the most affected. It was the biggest user of that plant, sourcing material to build its aluminum-bodied F-150—the most popular passenger vehicle in the country.

In response to this supply chain disruption, Ford paused production of the F-150 Lightning to focus production on the more profitable, higher-demand gas-powered variants. This makes a lot of sense; the F-150 Lightning may have been the best-selling EV truck last quarter, but the 10,000 units moved are just a drop in the bucket compared to the 207,000 gas-powered F-150s sold in the same period.

With demand for electric vehicles now falling off a cliff, Ford is reportedly considering whether to restart production of the F-150 Lightning at all, according to this report from the Wall Street Journal:

Ford Motor executives are in active discussions about scrapping the electric version of its F-150 pickup, according to people familiar with the matter, which would make the money-losing truck America’s first major EV casualty.

The Lightning, once described by Ford as a modern Model T for its importance to the company, fell far short of expectations as American truck buyers skipped the electric version of the top-selling truck. Ford has racked up $13 billion in EV losses since 2023.

Overall EV sales, already falling short of expectations, are expected to plummet in the absence of government support. And big, electric pickups and SUVs are the most vulnerable.

The report goes on to say that no final decision has been made, though considering Ram made the call to cancel its yet-to-be-released EV pickup just two months ago, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Ford follow suit. The signs of reduced EV truck demand are elsewhere in the market, too. Rivian, makers of the R1T pickup, just laid off 600 people. And sales of Tesla’s electric pickup, the Cybertruck, haven’t been doing well for months.

It’s not just the F-150 that’s in danger. WSJ says General Motors executives are considering axing some electric trucks from the lineup, too, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The company builds three electric pickups right now: The Silverado EV, the Sierra EV, and the Hummer EV.

In the near future, I predict the demand for electric trucks will stay level or trickle down slightly. The truth is, most people want a gas engine in their pickups if they want to do pickup things, like towing and hauling. The proof can be seen in reservations for Scout’s new truck, where 80% of buyers want the range extender over the pure EV.

Trucks that rely on battery power alone are not the move for serious tow duty, as pulling all that extra weight zaps range to impractical levels. Plus, electric trucks are usually more expensive than their ICE-powered counterparts. Extended-range EV pickups like the new Scout and Ram’s upcoming 1500 REV have all of the same benefits as a pure EV, plus they can cover the range problem thanks to the onboard gas generator. For most buyers, it’s the logical solution.

Elon Gets His Wish. Now He Has To Make It Happen

Back in September, Tesla proposed a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that, should he accomplish a series of lofty financial benchmarks, would add nearly $900 billion to his net worth, making him the world’s first trillionaire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this proposal faced lots of criticism, seeing as how it would make Musk, already the world’s richest person, the highest-paid CEO in the history of CEOs.

Many believe Tesla’s valuation and future success hinge on Musk staying as CEO, though the South African-born exec seems to believe his most important role will be being in control of the company’s forthcoming robot army. Either way, shareholders of the automaker voted overwhelmingly to ratify the pay package, with Musk celebrating in the only way he knows how: Next to his machines. From Reuters:

The proposal was approved with over 75% support, and Musk bounded to the stage of the company’s annual meeting at its factory in Austin, Texas, accompanied by dancing robots.

Musk, already the world’s richest person, could get as much as $1 trillion in stock over the next decade, although required payments would take the value down to $878 billion.

The vote is crucial for Tesla’s future and its valuation, which hangs on Musk’s vision of making vehicles that drive themselves, creating a robotaxi network across the U.S. and selling humanoid robots, even though his far-right political rhetoric has hurt the Tesla brand this year.

“What we are about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” Musk told a cheering group of shareholders.

[…]

“Other shareholder meetings are like snoozefests, but ours are bangers,” Musk said. “I mean, look at this. This is sick.”

It’s important to note that Tesla won’t just hand Musk $878 billion over the next decade. The package requires him to accomplish some incredibly lofty tasks, including growing Tesla’s stock value by eight times, deploying a million robotaxis, selling a million humanoid robots, selling 20 million more cars, growing full self-driving subscriptions to 10 million users, and increasing operating profits to $400 billion. As I said in my previous coverage of Musk’s pay proposal, doing all of that seems pretty impossible, considering Tesla’s reputation and aging lineup.

Toyota Still Can’t Get Its V6s Right

Last year, Toyota, widely known as builders of some of the most reliable, durable, and longest-lasting vehicles on the planet, caught a lot of flak for having to replace the engines in over 100,000 trucks and SUVs equipped with the company’s relatively new 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6.

Back then, Toyota said leftover machining debris from the factory was wreaking havoc on the V6’s internals, could could lead to engine knock and total engine shutdown. The company quickly reworked its manufacturing process, saying that any engine built after those deemed potentially faulty “were manufactured with new or improved processes that better clear machining debris.”

Well, it turns out that the new process wasn’t good enough, because Toyota is recalling even more V6s for the same problem. From the company’s website:

Toyota is conducting a safety recall involving certain model year 2022-2024 Toyota Tundra, 2022-2024 Lexus LX, and 2024 Lexus GX vehicles in North America. Approximately 127,000 Toyota- and Lexus-branded vehicles (conventional gas models only) are involved in this recall in the U.S.

There is a possibility that certain machining debris may not have been cleared from the engine when it was produced. In the involved vehicles, this can lead to potential engine knocking, engine rough running, engine no start, and/or a loss of motive power. A loss of motive power while driving at higher speeds can increase the risk of a crash.

Toyota says it’s “currently developing the remedy” for this problem, though if I had to guess, it’s probably just going to replace these engines like it did with the last bad batch. If I were an owner, that’s what I’d want. Even if an engine doesn’t immediately fail due to errant metal debris, I’d worry it could be enough to cause serious damage in the long term.

Can You Believe It? The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again

In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time. This comes after reports that Musk had planned to show off the car by the end of this year. The new proposed reveal date isn’t inspiring much confidence. From TechCrunch:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.

Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.”

“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said.

In some even more upsetting news for reservation-holders of the car, Musk went on to say that production of the Roadster won’t begin until 12 to 18 months after the reveal. So, at minimum, it won’t be until April 2027 that this car hits the road—nearly an entire decade since it was first revealed.

If Musk is to be believed, the production Roadster should, at least, be pretty different from the car we saw in 2017. From TechCrunch:

Musk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.

I’ll believe it when I see it (on the road, that is).

Leaders broadly agreed that global climate action is diminishing. In his opening remarks, UN Secretary-General António Guterres criticized countries that have abandoned their climate commitments and “remain captive to… fossil fuel interests.” Leaders from Brazil, Chile, and Colombia echoed this sentiment and urged other leaders not to follow suit. Guterres added that exceeding 1.5°C (2.7°F) of warming is a “moral failure and deadly negligence.”

Roll Call: The World Leaders Summit had only half of the attendance of COP29’s. Leaders from China, the EU, France, the UK, COP29 host Azerbaijan, COP28 host UAE, and Australia and Turkey (both of whom hold competing bids to host COP31) all made opening remarks. The U.S., India, and Russia were notably absent.

New Forest Fund: On the first day of the World Leaders Climate Action Summit, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF). The multilateral fund will pay heavily forested developing countries to leave these ecosystems intact, with 20% of these payments going to Indigenous and local communities. Upon its launch, the TFFF collected endorsements from 53 countries and more than $5.5 billion in pledges, with $3 billion from Norway, $1 billion each from Brazil and Indonesia, $500 million from France, $250 million from Colombia, $5 million from the Netherlands, and $1 million from Portugal, with more pledges expected over the course of COP30.

Local Leaders for Global Action: The COP30 Local Leaders Forum took place on November 3 through 5 in Rio de Janeiro. The COP30 Presidency and Bloomberg Philanthropies co-hosted a series of high-level gatherings that resulted in the release of the Local Leaders Joint Statement on behalf of leaders from more than 14,000 cities, towns, states, regions, and provinces across the globe. The statement presents three commitments in the spirit of “mutirão” (continuous mobilization) to help meet the urgency of climate action this decade: supporting national climate goals by engaging as partners, ensuring a pipeline of over 2,500 bankable local projects, and advancing multilevel action and collaboration to facilitate implementation and accountability within the COP process.

Award Season: Part of the Local Leaders Forum, the 2025 Local Leaders Climate Awards honored the most ambitious and impactful policies, projects, programs, and partnerships spearheaded by cities, states, and regions. There were two winners for each of the six categories: Energy Transition & Smarter Buildings (Boston and Juiz de Fora, Brazil); Clean, Reliable Transportation (Oslo, Norway, and São Paulo, Brazil); Safer Infrastructure for a Changing World (Beijing, China, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Healthy Cities, Strong Communities (Sofia, Bulgaria, and Barcarena, Brazil); Sustainable Waste Solutions (Quezon City, Philippines, and Salvador, Brazil); and Power of Partnership (Scotland and Piauí, Brazil).

A Tale of (More than Two) Cities: The C40 World Mayors Summit, co-hosted by London Mayor and C40 Cities Co-Chair Sadiq Khan and Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, kicked off the Local Leaders Forum with a gathering of nearly 100 mayors. Kate Johnson, regional director for North America at C40, stated on EESI’s podcast that C40’s main goals for the summit are to give hope that city-level climate action can accelerate progress towards national goals, to inspire confidence among mayors who are facing political headwinds, and to influence momentum at the upcoming negotiations in Belém.

EESI Podcast: “Smaller Scale, Greater Impact: Subnational Climate Diplomacy at COP30”

Mind the Gap: Each year ahead of COP, the UN Environment Programme publishes the Emissions Gap Report and the Adaptation Gap Report, designed to highlight the difference between climate commitments made and actual progress achieved. The Emissions Gap Report, bluntly titled Off Target, states that keeping warming to under 1.5°C (2.7°F) and 2°C (3.6°F) would require “rapid and unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions far above what has been pledged.” It adds that in a best-case scenario, warming would be kept to 1.9°C (3.4°F), and emphasizes that the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is expected to cut progress by about 0.1°C (0.18°F). The Adaptation Gap Report, Running on Empty, found adaptation financing needs of developing countries to be 12 to 14 times greater than current finance flows.

And Another Emissions Report: The new Rhodium Climate Outlook 2025 generally echoes the findings of the Emissions Gap Report, leading with the headline, “although we’ve avoided the most catastrophic projections, the world is on track to exceed 2°C [3.6°F] of temperature rise.” The report details sector-by-sector emissions, highlighting that the industrial sector is responsible for the highest share of emissions globally and is projected to remain in that position through 2050.

EESI Briefing: How Can We Cut Industrial Emissions?

Green Climate Fund: The Green Climate Fund was established in 2015 by countries under the UNFCCC. In the 10 years since, funding for mitigation and adaptation projects has reached $19.3 billion (up from $145.8 million), and project support has expanded to 134 countries (up from eight countries). Together, these projects have avoided the equivalent of 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. At its most recent meeting last week, the Green Climate Fund board approved a record $3.26 billion for projects in developing countries.

Representation at COPs: A report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development examines the history of Indigenous Peoples’ engagement with and access to the UNFCCC process and that of its two sister conventions, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. The report details how Indigenous knowledge is currently incorporated into the draft indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation.

Private Sector in São Paulo: The Bloomberg-sponsored COP30 Business and Finance Forum took place in São Paulo, Brazil, earlier this week. Coming out of this event, the We Mean Business Coalition penned a letter to world leaders. The core message is twofold: national governments should commit to high ambition at COP30, and reconsider the way their domestic clean energy finance incentives are written in order to boost private sector investment. The letter specifically calls for redirecting the $1 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies to the clean energy transition. The letter’s signatories represent more than 135,000 companies.

The event follows the Governor’s recent signing of new legislation and funding to propel and maintain the state’s leadership in the quantum industry, research, and development.

Quantum: computing capability for the future

Quantum computing has the potential to solve equations in mere minutes that would take existing computers thousands of years to complete — enabling immense potential to enhance medication discovery, improve artificial intelligence tools, combat climate change, and model complex scenarios. Quantum sensing can revolutionize how we see the world, and quantum communication can usher in unhackable quantum networks.

During today’s convening, officials and experts in the field discussed recent breakthroughs and near-term use cases in quantum computing, sensing, networking, and materials & devices (M&D) — tools and technologies likely to revolutionize medicine, climate research, security, and the way we connect to the world. The Governor opened the event with a video message.

They also examined how California’s national quantum centers, national labs, and quantum foundries can provide shared infrastructure and secure testbeds, standardize materials and devices, and move prototypes toward deployed systems for critical applications such as drug discovery and advanced manufacturing.

The Golden State’s quantum advantage

California is uniquely positioned to lead in this critical sector. It is the only state home to both the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy quantum research centers, produces the nation’s top quantum talent, is headquarters for the world’s leading quantum companies, and has five of the world’s top fifteen artificial intelligence programs — at UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, UCLA, Stanford and Caltech.

“Quantum California brings together some of the world’s best researchers, most successful businesses, and top state leaders to advance technology, science, and economic strength — and ensure that California remains the world’s innovation hub,” said University of California President James B. Milliken. “From our campuses to our national labs, UC researchers are at the vanguard of quantum breakthroughs, paving the way to a healthier, safer, and more prosperous California. UC is proud to join our partners in this effort.”

Leading quantum research centers are also based at UC Berkeley, UCLA, USC, and Stanford, alongside industry partners like the Google Quantum AI Campus (affiliated with UC Santa Barbara), Microsoft’s Station Q Lab (UC Santa Barbara), and the Amazon Web Services Center for Quantum Computing (Caltech).

“Berkeley is thrilled and honored to be the launchpad for ‘Quantum California,” said UC Berkeley Chancellor Rich Lyons. “Our university excels at what this moment demands: fueling and facilitating the free exchange of ideas between academia, industry, and the government in pursuit of discoveries that will advance the health, well-being, and security of the American people.”

Investing in the technologies of the future

As breakthroughs in research increasingly rely on advanced technology, California is investing in emerging fields such as quantum to drive innovation across disciplines. In October, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation and announced new funding to propel the state’s quantum industry, a key tradeable “bet” sector under the California Jobs First Economic Blueprint.

Assembly Bill 940, authored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), will drive California’s efforts forward by creating a statewide strategy to transform quantum research into industry output. Under the bill, GO-Biz will publish a strategic framework, aligned with the state’s Economic Blueprint, to help grow the quantum economy in regions throughout the state. This framework, paired with a $4 million investment from the state’s budget, will support a robust talent pipeline, foster new research and development, and unlock new possibilities across strategic sectors and industries.

“Quantum California is about turning discovery into opportunity so that our state’s research powerhouses can connect with entrepreneurs and companies to drive real innovation, investment, and job creation,” said Dee Dee Myers, Senior Advisor to Governor Newsom and Director of the GO-Biz. “No other place in the world has the ability to bring together this depth of talent, technology, and creativity as a force for economic progress.”

California’s economic strength

California is not only a national economic powerhouse — it is driving the future. The state is one of the world’s largest economies, feeds the country, and leads the nation in new business starts, access to venture capital funding, manufacturing, and agriculture. With an increasing state population and record-high tourism spending, California’s economy continues to grow across key regions and sectors — proving that innovation and inclusion go hand in hand.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Quantum-California.png,N,,2025-11-07 21:18:29.591179

Climate policy reversals under Trump Trump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.","ATHENS, Greece (AP) — U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday condemned the COP30 environmental summit as harmful and misguided — defying the global scientific consensus and concern by governments worldwide on climate change.

“It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told The Associated Press at the close of a two-day business conference in Athens. He added that he might attend next year's summit “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

Wright’s comments came as world leaders gathering over 5,000 miles away, on the edge of the Amazon in Brazil, blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for his absence from the United Nations-sponsored discussions on climate change running through Nov. 21. His remarks echoed the U.S. administration’s rejection of global climate agreements and Trump's prioritization of fossil fuels.

The White House confirmed Friday the U.S. will send no high-level officials to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Wright led a senior U.S. delegation to Athens for talks centered on boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe and Ukraine. Among them were Interior secretary Doug Burgum, deputy secretaries and the new U.S. ambassador to Greece and close Trump ally, Kimberly Guilfoyle.

At the forum, top U.S. officials criticized European Union carbon reduction policies, arguing they undermine economic growth, democratic alliances, and global leadership in AI and energy innovation.

A world away, leaders take aim at Trump's claims

It was a stark contrast with the Brazilian city of Belem, where world leaders at COP30 issued urgent warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming, driven in large part by emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said a “moral failure” to act would trigger rising hunger, displacement, and environmental damage.

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.

Latin American leaders attending COP30 in Belem took swipes at Trump for his stance on climate discussions.

“Today Mr. Trump is against humanity. His absence is proof of that,” Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said in his speech on Thursday. “What should we do then? Leave him alone. Oblivion is the biggest punishment.”

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva struck a more moderate tone regarding Trump’s absence, expressing hope that his U.S. counterpart would eventually change his mind.

“President Trump told me he doesn’t believe in green energy, Lula told reporters earlier this week. “He will believe in it, because he'll realize that we don’t have much of an alternative.”

Trump wasn’t the only one staying away; the summit was also notably absent of leaders from China and India. Together, these three nations are the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Wright — a former fossil fuel executive who has been a leading voice against efforts to fight climate change — defended Washington’s stance, arguing that global gatherings should prioritize energy access, growth and technological advancement over what he described as fear-driven environmentalism.

“Gatherings of global leaders and businesses should be about humans … not on the desire to scare children and grow government power,” he told the AP in Athens. “They’ve lost the plot.”

The Belem talks opened as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, the World Meteorological Organization reported Thursday.

Climate policy reversals under Trump

Trump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

At the start of his second term, Trump again withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, while the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations.

Trump created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers. Under executive orders, the EPA and other federal agencies have sought to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.

“Perhaps in no other time in history have leaders in Washington been more determined to pull the United States backwards in the fight against the climate crisis,"" Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Friday in a statement.

Smith",,,,,https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2025/11/07/the_texas_energy_experiment_1146123.html,"It is not as well known that Texas also leads the U.S. in electricity production using renewables.
In the first half of 2025, Texas led the nation in renewable energy production, 181,000 GWh.
Texas also leads in the installation of new solar and wind capacity and battery storage.
In 2025, Texas is installing enough new solar capacity to exceed California’s utility-scale solar capacity.
There are several reasons: Texas has a state-wide electric grid managed by ERCOT (The Electric Reliability Council of Texas).","A very important experiment is being conducted in Texas. It will demonstrate the relative merits of electricity production using fossil fuels versus solar and wind based upon cost, availability and reliability.

We know that Texas is a fossil fuel powerhouse accounting for about 42% of oil production and 27% of natural gas production in the U.S.

It is not as well known that Texas also leads the U.S. in electricity production using renewables. In the first half of 2025, Texas led the nation in renewable energy production, 181,000 GWh. California was second with 85,000 MWh.

Texas also leads in the installation of new solar and wind capacity and battery storage. Texas has the largest wind capacity of any state by a wide margin. In 2025, Texas is installing enough new solar capacity to exceed California’s utility-scale solar capacity. Texas also leads on the installation of utility-scale battery capacity needed to stabilize the electric grid by storing electricity when renewable electricity production exceeds demand and releasing electricity when demand exceeds supply.

How is this possible? There are several reasons:

Texas has a state-wide electric grid managed by ERCOT (The Electric Reliability Council of Texas). Thanks to this grid, it is easy to connect the best areas for solar and wind farms to electricity customers throughout the state.

Texas has a competitive retail electricity market. Producers have incentives to use the lowest cost sources for electricity and pass the lower costs on to customers. Low electricity prices result from the use of low-cost natural gas, not just renewables. The average electricity rate in Texas is 12 cents/kWh compared to the national average of 15 cents/kWh. The average rate in California is 30 cents/kWh.

Texas favors new development and it is easier and quicker to get new energy projects approved and implemented than in most other states.

The state leads in the addition of utility scale batteries to store electricity to smooth out supply and demand to stabilize the grid. ERCOT actively manages the grid in real time. Large electricity users can be required to adjust their electricity use when total demand is high. Additions to solar, wind and battery capacities has added to electricity reserves and strengthened the state’s ability to reduce or avoid blackouts and brownouts during times of peak demand.

Texas’ abundant and low-cost electricity will be a big help in developing the state’s economy. Low-cost electricity from renewables will support Texas’ production of green hydrogen, a fuel for the future.

California is second to Texas in renewable energy. However, California has among the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S. and imports up to 25% of its electricity. This is in spite of having excellent potential for solar and wind projects. California does not have a competitive electricity market. The Public Utilities Commission approves electricity rates requested by the state’s three large utilities. This high and rising cost of electricity in California works against the greater use of electricity from renewables for transportation, home heating and other uses being mandated by the state.

Conclusions.

The current administration is cancelling or discouraging renewable energy projects and their federal subsidies. However, solar and wind farms with battery backup are increasingly the lowest cost source of electricity in many locations.

Longer-term renewables future success in the U.S. will depend upon the cost and reliability of electricity from renewables compare to fossil fuels without subsidies and other government incentives. Based upon what is happening in Texas and many other locations, renewables could increasingly be the preferred alternative. For cost comparisons without subsidies, an adjustment is needed to eliminate the fossil fuel subsidy associated with the ability to discharge greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere for free.

(DTN) -- The Trump administration granted two full small-refinery exemptions, 50% exemptions on 12 petitions and denied two other petitions for compliance years 2021 to 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a Renewable Fuel Standard announcement on Friday.

The announcement comes as the agency also considers public comments made on a proposal to reallocate biofuels gallons lost on 140 partial and full exemptions granted by the administration recently.

""With most of the old petitions now cleared, EPA is committed to working with DOE (U.S. Department of Energy) to address new petitions as quickly as possible and within the 90-day statutory review period, ... "" the EPA said in a news release.

""Furthermore, on Sept. 16, 2025, the agency announced a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking that takes into consideration the expected impacts of the Aug. 22, 2025, SRE decisions. EPA is reviewing comments on the supplemental proposed rule as the agency continues to work on final regulations for the 'Set 2' rule. As stated in the (supplemental proposal), EPA intends to update the agency's projections of exempted gasoline and diesel volumes in the final rule based on any additional SREs issued after the proposal, including the petition decisions in this action.""

EPA said announcement was part of the Trump EPA's ""commitment to get the RFS program back on track"" with an approach that recognizes ""some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others"" and that EPA's relief should reflect those differences.

""EPA is reaffirming the agency's policy of returning RFS compliance credits, known as renewable identification numbers, previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year,"" the agency said.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement he questions EPA's decision.

""Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,"" Cooper said.

""EPA added another 14 small-refinery exemptions to the already-massive pile today, based on the agency's questionable new approach to determining whether those refiners experienced 'disproportionate economic hardship.'""

Cooper said the RFA continues to dispute the notion that SREs are ""warranted at all"" since the agency's own analysis shows that all refiners -- large and small -- face a proportional RFS compliance obligation and pass their RIN costs through to buyers of their refined products.

""The silver lining here is that EPA is returning expired RINs to the six refineries who were granted exemptions from their 2021 and 2022 RFS obligations,"" Cooper said.

""However, more than 500 million valid RINs will be issued to eight refineries who were gifted exemptions from their 2023 and 2024 obligations, meaning there are now more than 2.5 billion RINs associated with 2023-2025 SREs that are likely to be dropped back onto the market in the months ahead.""

Cooper said if EPA decides not to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes, the ""impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating.""

He said EPA's decision further underscores the ""crucial need"" for EPA to finalize 2026-2027 renewable volume obligations that fully reallocate any and all SREs granted, or expected to be granted, for the 2023-2027 compliance years.

A trade and climate partnership would serve the common interest of both China and Europe.
But it can be envisioned only if China ends its support for Russian aggression and adopts a more neutral stance.","GENEVA/PARIS – In early 2021, the European Union shelved the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment it had negotiated with China after the United States signaled its disapproval. At the time, deferring to the new US administration seemed prudent, because Europe was eager to rebuild transatlantic unity after Donald Trump’s first term. For a while, it looked like a wise move: US President Joe Biden soon rejoined the Paris climate agreement and proclaimed that “America is back.”

To be sure, the relationship between Europe and the Biden administration was not frictionless, especially after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which mobilized tens of billions of dollars to support US industries. Overall, though, transatlantic disputes were contained, and America’s steadfast support for Ukraine appeared to have shored up transatlantic relations.

But since Trump’s return to the White House, transatlantic solidarity has again curdled into strategic vulnerability. Sweeping US tariffs have hurt friends and foes alike. Fearing a complete withdrawal of US military support for Ukraine (or worse), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to a one-sided handshake trade deal with Trump in Scotland. Meanwhile, the US has continued to dismantle the postwar order, regarding it as what Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls a “weapon being used against us.”

After again withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, Trump is actively undermining renewable energy and climate action more broadly. In mid-October, the US unilaterally sabotaged a recently agreed International Maritime Organization compact on reducing emissions from shipping; and this month, it will do what it can to derail an ambitious agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil.

Tragically, with the world missing meaningful chances to keep global temperatures near the Paris targets, the risk of a deeper unraveling has grown. That may suit US short-term interests and the fossil-fuel lobbies, but it will spell disaster for the planet – especially the most vulnerable developing countries.

The one point on which Republicans and Democrats agree is that China must not be allowed to supplant the US as the de facto leader of the international order. While the latest rapprochement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may de-escalate bilateral tensions for a while, it certainly does not change the nature of a rivalry that will shape international relations for many years, if not decades.

Faced with American nationalism and Chinese assertiveness, Europe can no longer afford strategic passivity. Despite its economic weight, it has not been a player in this game, and certainly not in the contest for global dominance.

As a supporter of a rules-based international order, Europe cannot side comfortably with either China or Trump’s America. But in an increasingly multipolar world, it does have enough clout to tilt the balance one way or another. While it has so far sided with the US, the Trump administration’s unpredictability and belligerence give Europe reason to consider alternative options.

Yes, the EU has its own grievances vis-à-vis China. But the two also have ample common ground, not least when it comes to climage change and the energy transition. As the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gases and top producer of clean tech, China’s manufacturing future hinges on the success of the global green transition.

China and Europe thus share a strategic interest in advancing the climate transition across emerging markets and low-income countries. After all, the fate of the climate – and of the natural environment – increasingly depends on developing economies, which already account for the bulk of current and future emissions. If their growth continues to be powered by fossil fuels, the resulting climate-driven damage will impose mounting costs on everyone. As we show in a recent policy paper, it is far more cost-effective to help emerging markets and developing economies expand through renewable energy than to pay for rapidly increasing climate-related costs.

To that end, a pragmatic partnership between Europe and China could help not only Europe and China, but all current and future generations. What would it take to pull it off? Given low mutual trust, several conditions must be met.

First, trade frictions must not become a stumbling block as Chinese net exports surge (owing to weak domestic demand), and as trade is redirected away from the US and toward Europe. To prevent increased frictions, both sides must show maturity and agree on a clear quid pro quo.

As French and German economists proposed in a recent memo to both governments, Chinese access to the European market should be unconditional for certain goods such as solar panels, but still conditional on Chinese direct investment in, and technology transfers to, Europe for goods like electric vehicles; at the same time, imports should remain severely restricted in certain industries deemed critical for national security.

The second and most challenging condition is geopolitical. Most Chinese analysts regard Europe as a mere vassal of the US, and see the war in Ukraine as a conflict between the latter and Russia over their relative spheres of influence.

Europeans, of course, have a different reading. They see Russia as an aggressive neo-imperial power that aims to get its hands on Europe if it can manage to neutralize Ukraine. In a context where the US is increasingly fixated on Asia and the rivalry with China, the Kremlin’s brazen hybrid war on Western Europe makes its intentions clear. A trade and climate partnership would serve the common interest of both China and Europe. But it can be envisioned only if China ends its support for Russian aggression and adopts a more neutral stance. The quid pro quo would be that Europe asserts real strategic autonomy vis-à-vis the US.

If Europe and China can meet these conditions, they can lay the foundation for a green, rules-based partnership – not against America, but in defense of the global commons and their own future.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/622685ad20f6960922635517853bb189.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 01:19:05.669195

The shutdown plan of the DOE reveals what projects and departments are essential to serving American energy priorities and which are not. Congress should make this restructuring of the DOE permanent by defunding projects and offices that are not contributing to a reliable, cheap, and secure energy supply.

The DOE Shutdown Plan

Under the Antideficiency Act, government agencies must halt activities that do not have appropriated funds unless they are expressly authorized by law, necessary to discharge the President’s constitutional duties, or required for the protection of life and property. Of the DOE’s 15,523 employees, 9,816 (63%) were furloughed on September 30, 2025, and 5,707 (37%) were retained as “essential.”

The DOE’s plan is built around those guardrails. Essential activities performed by the DOE are primarily focused on nuclear security issues (i.e., experts on naval nuclear reactors and nonproliferation staff stay on duty to monitor and secure nuclear materials). Other departments that have received the essential designation include the Power Administrations, the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, and the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence.

Most DOE offices closed during the government shutdown are resource and advocacy offices that issue grants and fund energy projects outside of the scope of national security or constitutional duties.

Not All Operating DOE Offices Are Truly “Essential”

Most offices under the essential heading are fulfilling constitutional duties or ensuring the security of essential personnel or property.

Others that do not perform these essential functions continue operating because they have current appropriations, not necessarily because they are national priorities.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) leads efforts to develop and implement clean energy technologies and is part of the grant issuing process for those projects. Because of advance appropriations, they can continue this work with the nearly $8 billion dollars in budgetary resources available.

Similarly, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED)has over $10.5 billion in available budgetary resources that they can use to continue funding “green” energy projects and promoting decarbonization initiatives despite the government shutdown.

The DOE’s four Power Marketing Administrations (Bonneville, Southwestern, Southeastern, and Western Area) should face tougher scrutiny from Congress despite their continued operation during the shutdown. The Bonneville Power Administration operates under an indefinite appropriation and has funds available to continue operating fully during the government shutdown. The other Power Marketing Administrations still have budgetary resources available to them and have continued to operate and provide power during the shutdown.

Power Administrations were created to sell federal hydropower and support rural electrification. Today, they function as government-run utilities with access to taxpayer money. The shutdown is an opportunity to re-evaluate the usefulness of these Power Administrations and whether they are still necessary. Rural electrification is well established with state and regional energy markets operating electricity generation and transmission systems across America. These Power Administrations should be phased out and removed to minimize the distortion of energy prices and allow more market competition between energy producers.

When the government reopens, Congress should consider defunding and phasing out these entities as part of the effort to right-size Washington and bring the growing national debt under control.

Office Closures that Should be Made Permanent

The DOE shutdown plan includes thirteen offices that it considers non-essential. Primarily, these offices focus on implementing climate programs, grant distribution, or industrial policy initiatives are not deemed necessary for the protection of life and property.

For example, the Arctic Energy Office largely funds studies, partnerships, and initiatives that focus on energy development in Alaska and the Arctic that do not contribute to nationwide energy reliability or security. They primarily focus on introducing and experimenting with renewable energy in the Arctic regions, such as the Alaska Solar Microgrid Working Group.

Similarly, the Indian Energy Policy and Programs Office provides grants, technical assistance, and planning support to Tribal governments for energy projects. In the absence of this Office, private partnerships and state-level programs could support Tribal energy development without requiring federal funds.

The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization should be removed entirely. This office promotes contracting opportunities for small and minority-owned businesses within DOE. Tax dollars should not be steered towards identity-based categories and DEI targets which results in the government picking winners and losers. Grants to minority-owned businesses are not essential to protect public safety and do not serve to enhance the performance of our energy grid.

Other offices providing grants or loans with little real value added include the State and Community Energy Program, the Loan Programs Office, the Office of Technology Commercialization. None of these offices provide critical funds for energy reliability or securing energy grids from attacks. Instead, they increase government interventions in the energy marketplace, driving up prices and reducing competition. Grants to “green energy sources” are not dispatchable, meaning that they cannot provide power when it is needed most, forcing utilities to maintain backup systems powered by fossil fuels or nuclear energy or else be unable to supply power when demand peaks. By subsidizing these projects, American consumers receive more expensive energy with less reliability. Offices dedicated to funding these projects are not serving the American people and should be closed.

The Energy Information Administration collects and publishes energy data, forecasts, and statistics. Although this data is useful, pausing these reports during a shutdown does not stop government operations or energy delivery. Congress should reassess whether to restart the office at its current scale, as many energy statistics are already produced by industry and independent analysts.

A Path to Sound Policymaking

Policymakers should use the DOE’s shutdown plan and office designations as a prioritization map going forward. Certain functions and projects that are still operating cannot fail without harmful effects: safeguarding nuclear materials, defending the energy system against cyber and physical threats, and meeting specific constitutional and legal obligations.

To prevent taxpayer funds from continuing to support wasteful energy initiatives, reforms such as the OCED Elimination Act of 2025 (H.R. 4172) sponsored by Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX-26) are needed.",https://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/matthew-henry-yETqkLnhsUI-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 00:22:14.071505

The other big utility in Michigan, DTE Energy, is taking a different approach.
Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece.","Michigan regulators on Thursday adopted landmark standards for the booming data center industry with a plan they say tries to protect residents from subsidizing the industry's hefty energy use.

In a 3-0 vote, the Michigan Public Service Commission adopted a rate structure that requires data centers and other energy-intensive industries in Consumers Energy's territory to sign long-term power contracts with steep penalties for exiting early.

The order also requires Consumers to show that data centers will shoulder all costs to build transmission lines, substations and other infrastructure before adding them to the grid.

Commission Chair Dan Scripps called it a ""balanced approach"" that shows Michigan is ""open for business from data centers and other large load customers, while also leveraging those potential benefits of the growth … in a way that's good for all customers.""

The deal disappointed some environmentalists, who had pushed for explicit requirements that data center power come from renewable sources. Michigan utilities are legally required to achieve 100% clean energy by 2040. They must detail how they plan to meet that requirement in filings next year.

""While the order includes important consumer protection terms, the commission missed an opportunity to emphasize the importance of the state's climate goals,"" said Daniel Abrams, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

The rate structure applies to customers whose energy use exceeds 100 megawatts. Data centers are among very few industries that demand that much power. Often, they demand an order of magnitude more.

Consumers serves 1.9 million customers across much of the Lower Peninsula. Company spokesperson Matt Johnson said officials are still reviewing Thursday's order and ""its impact on all stakeholders.

""Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state's economic development,"" he added.

The deal comes amid an uncertain time for the data industry, which is growing fast because of artificial intelligence. Much more energy is needed to power the transformation, but many industry analysts fear rising AI stocks are a bubble and demand for the technology won't materialize, leaving utilities and ratepayers to pick up the infrastructure tab for failed projects.

Hoping to avoid such an outcome, Consumers in February proposed special regulations that would lock data centers into 15-year contracts that guarantee consistent electricity use and require payments even if a facility ceases or downsizes operations mid-contract.

The commission's decision Thursday approves much of that request, with some significant modifications.

The other big utility in Michigan, DTE Energy, is taking a different approach.

Rather than establishing a blanket rate structure like Consumers, DTE wants to negotiate its first data center contract individually while aiming to avoid public vetting of the deal.

After announcing last week that it had inked an agreement to supply power for a proposed Stargate data center in Saline Township, DTE filed a draft 19-year contract with state energy regulators and requested swift approval without a public hearing.

Michigan law allows such expedited reviews in cases that would bring no added costs to utility consumers.

DTE officials argue adding the Stargate data center to its system will help keep rates down for everyone by spreading fixed costs among more paying customers.

""Given the sizable affordability benefits for our customers, as well as the economic impact the project will have, we think moving forward in this fashion makes the most sense,"" spokesperson Jill Wilmot said.

But DTE officials also stated in its filing that the company expects to spend some $500 million upgrading its transmission system and building a substation to serve the data center. Critics argue the utility is so intentionally vague it is impossible to vet DTE's claims about affordability.

""It's just highly concerning that they are trying to keep this somewhat private, because there's so much at stake,"" said Bryan Smigielski, a Michigan organizer with the Sierra Club.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also opposes DTE's quest for expedited review, and has requested a thorough vetting of the proposed contract.

Members of the Public Service Commission have not decided whether to grant DTE's request for quick approval, Scripps said.

Michigan's data center electricity rate deliberations come amid a surge of interest from developers looking to take advantage of new tax breaks that could save the industry tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers last year voted to exempt large data centers from Michigan's 6% sales and use tax in an effort to lure the industry to Michigan.

Beyond the Stargate campus, DTE is in late-stage negotiations for another 3 gigawatts' worth of data center capacity, while Consumers Energy is nearing deals for three large data centers amounting to a collective 2 gigawatts of power.

Developers are also scoping out rural land throughout the southern Lower Peninsula, from the Grand Rapids area to the outskirts of Monroe.

The wave of interest could have big implications for water and land use in Michigan. Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece. Those that use water vapor to cool the servers inside the facilities — the industry's most common cooling technique — also use large amounts of water.

STATE NEWS

VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS SECURE WINS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT: Democrats in Virginia had a historic election night, securing more seats in the House of Delegates than they’ve had in three decades while sweeping all three statewide offices. Energy affordability was top of mind for Virginia voters, who are facing rising costs and utility bills from data centers. Virginia LCV’s Political Action Committee invested more than $3 million this cycle through field, mail, digital, and direct contributions, knocked over 208,000 doors, and mobilized more than 400 volunteers. Read more about Virginia LCV’s role in the 2025 elections.

VALCV TAKE: VALCV Executive Director Michael Town said, “Tonight was an incredible night for Democrats who ran and won on a message of putting Virginians – not big corporations – first, addressing rising energy costs, and standing up for an affordable, clean energy future. By and large this was a message that resonated with voters, and the incoming majority – the largest in three decades – now has a mandate to deliver on policies that cut energy bills, hold big corporations accountable, and secure our transition to an affordable, clean energy future. After four years of stalled progress in Virginia, we look forward to working with the new ‘Conservation Majority’ to get this done.”

AFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY CHAMPIONS WIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION RACE IN GEORGIA: In a historic election, Dr. Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard were elected to Georgia’s Public Service Commission. These wins mark the first time a Democrat has won a statewide, nonfederal office in Georgia since 2006. Georgia Conservation Voters Action Fund (GCVAF) played an integral role in this race, spending more than $2.3 million this cycle and targeting over 1.8 million voters through billboards, SMS texting, direct mail and digital ads squarely focused on costs. GCVAF also published a webpage where voters could see just how much their bills have risen.

GCV TAKE: Georgia Conservation Voters Executive Director Brionté McCorkle said, “The message of this election is unmistakable: Georgians demand an end to utility bill rate hikes and corporate politics as usual on the PSC. Georgia Conservation Voters and our affiliated entities invested over $3 million in these elections, marking our largest investment ever because we had to make sure voters knew the stakes at the ballot box – from utility bills to corporate polluters.”

MIKIE SHERRILL WINS NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR’S RACE: In New Jersey, former Representative Mikie Sherrill celebrated a decisive victory in the governor’s race, beating her opponent Jack Ciatarelli by a wide margin. New Jersey LCV Victory Fund invested over $1.7 million in a campaign showcasing Ciatarelli’s costly energy policies, successfully driving up his unfavorability. Sherrill is a dedicated climate champion who has committed to declaring a statewide energy emergency and full rate freeze on day one in office to address rising utility costs and hold Big Polluters accountable.

NEW JERSEY LCV TAKE: New Jersey LCV Executive Director Ed Potosnak said, “Mikie Sherrill’s historic win in Tuesday’s election marks a strong rebuke of the right-wing, MAGA agenda parroted by Jack Ciattarelli. The environment was on the ballot in the Garden State – and we were there from the beginning as the first issue group to endorse Mikie Sherrill for Governor and invested the largest ever to elect her because of her unflinching support for the environment and offensive to lower electricity costs by rapidly expanding the cheapest source of power, clean energy.

“Her victory ensures that a strong environmental champion will be taking the reins of our state, one who is laser-focused on lowering skyrocketing electricity prices with new sources of clean energy which is the cheapest source of power. We look forward to working with Governor-elect Sherrill and continuing New Jersey’s role as a national leader in environmental protection, safeguarding clean drinking water, preserving open spaces and advancing clean energy. We know that robust environmental policies create good union jobs, lower costs for working families, and ensure all New Jerseyans, regardless of zip code, can breathe clean air and drink pure water. Working together, we know that we can build a stronger and more prosperous future for ourselves and our children, one where clean energy powers our state, creates union jobs, improves public health, and lowers costs for overburdened families.”

MAINE REJECTS LIMITS ON VOTING: Voters in Maine rejected Question 1, a ballot measure that would limit absentee voting and impose onerous voter ID requirements. The state overwhelmingly voted to keep the current system in place, ensuring changes that may limit people from voting will not be enacted.

MCV TAKE: Maine Conservation Voters said, “Mainers from all over the state overwhelmingly said no to limits on absentee voting and harmful voter ID requirements. Mainers know our election system works and allows voters to cast their ballot in a way that best suits their needs. We have some of the highest voter turnout of ANY state in the country to prove it!

“Today, the message from voters is clear – our system works, and we don’t want changes that would stop people from voting. We are immensely proud of the coalition that drove these results and of the Mainers everywhere who made their voices heard. There are still many fights ahead, but please take a moment today to celebrate and enjoy this hard-earned victory.”

NATIONAL NEWS

ENERGY AFFORDABILITY DRIVES DEMOCRATIC WINS ACROSS THE NATION: In Georgia, New Jersey, and Virginia, Democratic candidates responded to voters’ concerns on energy cost and celebrated wins across the board. Decisive victories for Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Democratic candidates for Georgia Public Service Commission proved that electricity bills are the kitchen table issue driving Democratic wins in 2025 and beyond.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber said, “In Georgia, New Jersey, and Virginia there was a clear line drawn between candidates responding to voters’ concerns about energy costs with real solutions, and those toeing the MAGA party line. Candidates who ignore rising energy costs do so at their own peril. This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump Administration’s ban on clean energy, multi-million dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher.

“Cost of living continues to be a major issue on voters’ minds, with rising energy costs among their top household budget concerns. Recent polling shows that the majority of voters believe that elected leaders have an impact on electricity costs. A majority of Americans also attribute rising costs to the GOP agenda, utility companies, and Big Oil CEOs. The reasoning is simple. The public understands that actively blocking the development of the cheapest and fastest-to-deploy power sources–wind, solar, and battery storage – only leads to more expensive options dominating the grid.”

More than 40% of Oklahoma’s energy generation comes from wind turbines and solar companies are showing increased interest in building projects in the state. Yet Oklahoma’s position as a top-tier renewable energy producer may fade following the passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Signed into law July 4, the megabill slashed tax incentives for wind and solar projects that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which were lauded as the U.S.’s first climate change mitigation law and passed during the Biden administration.

These cuts are expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Without tax credits the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies will most likely respond by building fewer of these projects, and those facilities that do come on line will be much more costly.

When that occurs, it’s expected that the country will increase generation of electricity from natural gas plants which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar operations.

That shift will hit states hardest that do not diversify their energy resources and require that a specified percentage of the electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resources.

In Oklahoma, Energy Innovation predicts that electricity rates for residential, commercial and industrial consumers will grow between 60% and 350% over the next decade. That means $100 annual increases in household energy bills by 2030 and $540 by 2035. There is also a dire forecast for decreased economic activity. Their modeling suggests that Oklahoma will lose out on significant planned private investment and suffer job losses.

These cuts along with multiple laws passed by the 2025 Oklahoma Legislature that tightened regulations on wind and solar energy will at the very least slow down if not effectively stop the state’s renewable energy development.

The One Big Beautiful Bill was signed into law about two weeks after representatives from utilities and the Southwest Power Pool warned the Oklahoma Corporation Commission that the state would see a significant energy demand that is likely to outgrow its current supply.

Clearly, our electric utilities and regulators were caught off guard by the biggest jump in demand in a generation. One of the things they didn’t properly plan for is artificial intelligence, an immensely power-hungry technology, and the accompanying explosion in data centers.

One data center today consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but some of those currently under construction will require 20 times more.

As projections soar the question about the energy sources that will power the increased demand remain unanswered.

Natural gas in Oklahoma makes up about half of its generation. But it’s unclear if an adequate number of new plants will be built in time since gas-fired turbines, which are used in a majority of the country’s facilities, are backlogged for up to seven years.

Over-reliance on gas plants, coupled with mistaken assumptions about their reliability, is a significant grid vulnerability.

Gas plant operations are particularly susceptible to damage and disruptions during extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and severe as the climate changes. Remember in 2021 Winter Storm Uri hit the central United States and knocked nearly a quarter of the affected area’s power plant capacity offline. Gas plants accounted for most of the failed capacity.

Utilities can bolster grid reliability by utilizing clean energy solutions. Pursuing clean energy solutions instead of fossil fuels lessens not only global warming emissions but also toxic air pollutants that harm public health, particularly in communities of color where gas plants are disproportionately located. Further, these demand-side solutions can reduce the need for new infrastructure and decrease the land-use impacts that come with large-scale projects.

Ratepayers should not bear the burden of hosting dirty gas plants whose pollution puts their health at risk nor should they be responsible for the infrastructure and service costs associated with rapid load growth due to large users such as data

Our legislators, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as well as utilities themselves should create unique electricity rate structures, or tariffs, for data centers. What this means is that data centers should be subject to rates, terms, and conditions that are more appropriate to how they use energy and their impact on the grid. Utility costs have long been assigned to the customers that cause those costs, at least in theory.

Meanwhile, utilities must prioritize the use of renewables, efficiency, energy storage, and other grid-supporting technologies to meet this demand.

Throwing new gas plants at the problem is an ineffectual attempt to keep up with energy demand predictions. We must recognize the paradigm shift that load growth from data centers represent and stop trying to solve new problems with old tools.

Conventional fertiliser production is heavily dependent on natural gas and coal, releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Instead of using fossil fuels to power industries, geothermal energy provides a clean, consistent, and locally available source of power.
Beyond its technical achievements, the green fertiliser innovation carries a powerful message: the transition to sustainable development is already underway.
The green fertiliser initiative embodies the spirit of innovation and self-reliance that is driving transformation across East Africa and beyond.","For decades, many farmers across the region have faced unpredictable fertiliser prices, high import costs, and erratic supply chains. However, a groundbreaking innovation recently realised in Kenya is transforming the way energy and agriculture intersect. Now, geothermal power can be utilised to produce ammonia and fertiliser locally, rendering the high costs and supply chain inconsistencies concerns of the past.

Developed by KenGen in partnership with China’s Kaishan Group, the fertiliser plant will use around 165 megawatts of geothermal power from Olkaria to synthesise green ammonia, which is then converted into fertiliser, projected at up to 480,000 tonnes annually. This development reflects a broader transformation in which clean energy and technology are woven into the fabric of daily life and livelihoods.

The green fertiliser plant will use steam to produce ammonia, the key ingredient in most fertilisers, without relying on fossil fuels. Through this process, renewable energy is directly linked to food production, demonstrating how sustainable technologies can drive both environmental and economic progress.

Locally produced fertiliser powered by renewable energy offers a path toward greater stability, affordability, and independence. It means that food producers can plan with confidence, grow more sustainably, and reduce the costs that often strain smallholder farmers.

What makes this project especially significant is its “green” foundation. Conventional fertiliser production is heavily dependent on natural gas and coal, releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By using geothermal energy, the new facility drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions, cutting more than half a million tonnes of CO₂ annually, equivalent to removing over 100,000 cars from the road. The result is an agricultural solution that not only feeds communities but also protects the planet.

This shift carries three broad benefits that extend well beyond agriculture itself:

Empowering communities and strengthening livelihoods

Sustainable fertiliser production opens new opportunities for employment, training, and innovation. Thousands of jobs are expected to be created in construction, operations, and maintenance, boosting local economies. Farmers will gain access to more reliable fertiliser supplies, leading to improved yields and incomes. This ripple effect can enhance food security, reduce poverty, and strengthen community resilience in both rural and peri-urban areas.

Pioneering a new model of clean industrial growth

The project demonstrates how renewable energy can be the foundation for modern manufacturing. Instead of using fossil fuels to power industries, geothermal energy provides a clean, consistent, and locally available source of power. This model of clean industrialisation could be replicated across the region, where abundant natural resources, such as geothermal energy, wind, and sunlight, offer immense potential. It signals a future in which sustainability and economic growth are not in conflict but in harmony.

Building a greener, more resilient regional economy

Producing fertiliser locally means fewer imports, lower transport emissions, and greater control over supply chains. It also aligns with global shifts toward sustainable production and trade, giving local products a competitive advantage in international markets. By reducing dependence on external inputs and fossil fuels, the region strengthens its resilience against economic shocks and environmental challenges.

Beyond its technical achievements, the green fertiliser innovation carries a powerful message: the transition to sustainable development is already underway. It shows that the tools to tackle climate change and food insecurity can be homegrown, drawing on local resources and ingenuity. With the right policies and partnerships, such innovations can be scaled to benefit millions, supporting not only agriculture but also the broader goals of clean energy, decent work, and environmental restoration.

Of course, the journey ahead requires commitment. Ensuring equitable access to affordable fertiliser, empowering smallholder farmers, and building the infrastructure to distribute products efficiently will be critical. But the foundation has been laid. The combination of renewable energy and local manufacturing represents a new chapter in how societies can grow food, create jobs, and protect natural resources simultaneously.

This is a glimpse into a future where sustainability is practical, profitable, and inclusive. The green fertiliser initiative embodies the spirit of innovation and self-reliance that is driving transformation across East Africa and beyond. As geothermal steam powers the production of clean, green fertiliser, it symbolises something more profound: the energy of a region ready to cultivate its own sustainable future, one harvest at a time.",https://vellum.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cropped-logo.png,N,,2025-11-07 21:18:43.496945

The majority dismissed these concerns, arguing that as long as any gas furnace types are still available, there is no coerced fuel switching.","On November 4, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit handed down a decision that is bad news for millions of homeowners in need of a new furnace. The only silver lining from American Gas Association et al. v. Dept. of Energy is that it might encourage Congress to step in and address the issue.

The Biden Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a wave of anti-consumer appliance efficiency standards, including one targeting residential gas furnaces. This 2023 rule effectively outlawed non-condensing gas furnaces in favor of condensing models. Condensing gas furnaces are more efficient and can comply with the new standard, but they can create costly installation challenges for millions of homes with venting systems designed for non-condensing models. This mandated transition will be most difficult–and in some cases virtually impossible–for older and space-constrained homes, which are disproportionately owned by low-income homeowners. The American Gas Association cites DOE data estimating that 30 percent of senior households and 26 percent of low-income households would experience net costs from the rule.

The statute authorizing appliance regulations, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), contains provisions protecting consumers from overzealous appliance efficiency regulations that deprive them of any desired product characteristics. Specifically, it expressly forbids any standard “likely to result in the unavailability in the United States…of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary’s finding.” It is hard to imagine any stronger language preserving consumer choice.

Nonetheless, DOE sidestepped this provision by essentially claiming that the specific type of gas furnace is not a protected feature. In the agency’s words, “the technology used to supply heated air or hot water is not a performance-related ‘feature’ that provides a distinct consumer utility under EPCA.”

CEI strongly disagreed with this interpretation. In comments critical of the proposed rule, we said that:

This is an unacceptably narrow reading of the features provision, whose broad language protects every aspect of a product that is of relevance to consumers. Here, the feature at issue is more accurately characterized as the furnace’s compatibility with the home in which it is to be installed – which of course is of great importance to the homeowner.

Unfortunately, a two-judge majority upheld DOE’s interpretation, deferring to the agency and confirming that non-condensing gas furnaces can be eliminated as an option in the regulatory pursuit of efficiency. However, a powerful dissent by Judge Neomi Rao came to the same conclusion as CEI, saying that:

Under the best meaning of EPCA, a “performance characteristic” is a distinctive product attribute that provides utility to the consumer. Non-condensing appliances plainly provide such utility through their unique venting method, which allows for direct integration into many existing exhaust systems without cumbersome and costly retrofits. This integration capability is a “performance characteristic” of noncondensing appliances that EPCA protects from regulatory elimination.

Rao noted that, in light of Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo (2024), DOE’s implausibly cramped interpretation of EPCA’s consumer protections should receive no deference, yet that is precisely what the majority opinion did.

DOE’s rule conceded that some homeowners, when faced with the high costs of a new condensing gas furnace (up to $867 more, according to DOE) would choose electric heat instead. CEI’s comments noted that such fuel-switching to electric is part of the climate agenda-inspired antipathy to natural gas and in any event is forbidden under EPCA’s prohibition against fuel-switching. The majority dismissed these concerns, arguing that as long as any gas furnace types are still available, there is no coerced fuel switching. The dissent argued that making gas versions prohibitively expensive and inconvenient for some homeowners amounts to coerced fuel switching and is one more reason DOE’s rule violates the law.

The case will likely be appealed, but the clock is ticking, and manufacturers need to know well ahead of the rule’s 2028 effective date which models are legal to manufacture and sell. In addition, the Trump DOE can and should revisit the regulation to better preserve consumer choice, but that will also take time and be subject to judicial review.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1344298893-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 18:58:49.747237

But out of the political spotlight, the real story is unfolding in colder homes, emptier fridges and workplaces where people are showing up without pay. The pain can be quiet, cumulative and largely invisible to those in power who call basic assistance like heating help and food security measures “extreme.”

In Maine, the emergency heating assistance program administered by MaineHousing has been halted due to the shutdown. For families already stretched thin, this isn’t a policy inconvenience – it’s a direct threat to their ability to stay warm as temperatures drop. Meanwhile, SNAP benefits are hanging in the balance, leaving households unsure of how they’ll pay for groceries this month.

At the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, more than 7,700 civilian employees are trapped in a cruel paradox. Classified as “essential,” they’re required to report to work during the federal shutdown, yet receive no pay. Because they remain technically employed, they’re ineligible for unemployment benefits. They can’t seek other jobs. They’re working without compensation, expected to shoulder the burden of political gridlock. But for many, that burden is simply too heavy.

And, in the middle of this, Republicans in Washington are arguing that extending health care tax credits, one of the most effective tools for keeping people insured, is somehow “extreme.” Let’s be clear: there is nothing extreme about helping people afford health care.

These enhanced premium tax credits, expanded under the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, have made coverage accessible for millions of Americans. They’ve lowered monthly premiums, stabilized the health care marketplace and helped reduce the uninsured rate to historic lows. If they are allowed to expire at the end of the year, premiums will skyrocket, coverage will drop and the very people already reeling from the shutdown, those relying on SNAP, heating assistance or working without pay, will be hit again.

This isn’t a theoretical policy debate. It’s a question of whether we believe that basic stability, food, heat, health care, is a right or a reward.

Calling these tax credits “extreme” is a rhetorical sleight of hand. It distracts from the real stakes: whether we choose to support working families or let them fall through the cracks. What’s truly extreme is asking people to navigate a shutdown, rising costs and health care insecurity all at once while pretending the tools to help them are somehow too generous or not available when the truth is they are simply being redirected to help fund tax breaks for billionaires.

We must stop framing basic survival as a partisan debate. Programs like SNAP, heating assistance, unemployment benefits and affordable health care aren’t optional extras, they’re essential infrastructure that keep thousands of Mainers and millions of families across the country afloat. These supports not only protect lives, they strengthen our economy with a proven return on investment. When the system falters, especially during a shutdown, these lifelines should never be the first to go, nor should they be used as political leverage.

The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.
""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we're breathing.
DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.
Though LEAN's early mobile testing didn't find St. Rose was an emissions hotspot, according to a report on that work, IMTT agreed to finance additional LEAN sensors.","After months of work and political wrangling over potential legal impact, a new, small network of air sensors began collecting real-time data in four Mississippi River communities and has already detected spikes in pollution since going live in September, an environmental group says.

For years, community and environmental advocates have argued that the state should require real-time, fence-line air monitoring around the state's major industrial facilities to supplement its regional network with more localized data. But the idea has faced resistance from industry, regulators and legislators over the cost, the fear of false positives and of providing fuel for lawsuits.

Located between Baton Rouge and New Orleans , new AQMesh sensors sponsored by environmental group LEAN represent a different tack, putting monitors in the community and offering, the nonprofit's officials believe, the potential to spur voluntary air quality improvements even if the sensors' data don't have regulatory teeth.

""It is our hope that by shining a light on contaminants in the air, we can show companies where their operations are having potentially adverse impacts on neighboring citizens, as well as on company workers, and can spur constructive discussions of ways to reduce emissions and lessen the health impacts,"" Marylee Orr, LEAN's executive director, said in a statement.

The AQMesh sensors can't carry the force of law because they don't meet a new state equipment standard, LEAN officials acknowledge, but they insist the accuracy is close to regulatory-level equipment.

Financed with part of a $500,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant, the four LEAN air sensors are located in Alsen, Geismar, St. James and Donaldsonville. The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.

Running since the beginning of the year, the four sensors were first calibrated for months standing next to Louisiana regulatory air monitors and were found to meet EPA thresholds for data comparability with the state equipment, LEAN's scientific advisors say.

The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. They also collect data on wind speed and direction, with the information published on LEAN's website every 15 minutes.

These pollutants are regulated by the state and federal government, have known health impacts and are common near industrial sources, but, in many cases, can come from many other sources as well.

Slawomir Lomnicki, an LSU environmental science professor who is advising LEAN, explained that the data so far are providing clear trends, including spikes in Geismar for volatile organic compounds, a class of chemicals that can be tied to toxic industrial pollution.

""When we look at the correlation between atmospherical conditions and these pollutants, in many cases, you can see a very clear correlation with the direction from where the plume is coming,"" he said.

'This is historic'

LEAN officials say they have been meeting with community members to discuss the data and then will facilitate meetings between residents and area companies ""to explore ways to correct and prevent emissions incidents.""

The arrival of the sensors has sparked a mix of praise and criticism from community groups, as well as caution from industry and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we're breathing. And now, we—the people—can be part of the solution,"" Pastor Harry Joseph, LEAN's local community shepherd, who oversees the air quality sensor in St. James Parish, said in a LEAN statement.

DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.

The Louisiana Chemical Association, a key trade group for river industries and outspoken critic of the cost and feasibility of public fence-line monitors, said it wants to review the findings ""to better understand"" them, ""confirm their methods and quality controls, and interpret how the results compare with reported emissions data from state and federal authorities.""

""Ambient measurements can reflect background levels and non-industrial contributors, including traffic and other businesses, so we want to ensure these are properly taken into account,"" said David Cresson, president and CEO of LCA and its sister organization, the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance.

""We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue.""

Other community groups have criticized the sensors as technologically insufficient, though those criticisms have come in the context of a parallel LEAN project still under development in St. Rose.

Four more AQMesh sensors are in place and being calibrated for future reporting in the St. Charles Parish community, where chronic smells and emissions have fueled concern over a large tank farm owned by International Matex Tank Terminals.

Those sensors come after DEQ removed one of its own community monitors a few years ago that both residents and IMTT had wanted to remain.

Though LEAN's early mobile testing didn't find St. Rose was an emissions hotspot, according to a report on that work, IMTT agreed to finance additional LEAN sensors. The data will be collected by a third party and published in real time on LEAN's website, like the current data.

Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh, who leads the St. Rose community group Refined Community Empowerment, said she didn't trust LEAN's early hotspot findings and argued the LEAN sensors won't provide specific enough information about what kinds of toxic chemicals are in the air.

Traci Johnson, IMTT's vice president for environment, health, safety and security, said the company followed LEAN's recommendations on which chemicals the sensors should test for.

'What's going on here?'

In 2024, as environmental groups began proposing their own community-based systems and conducting other efforts like mobile air monitoring, the Legislature pushed through new rules that barred data from these systems from being used for regulatory actions or lawsuits if they didn't match federal standards for regulatory air monitoring equipment.

That law is the subject of a 1st Amendment lawsuit brought in federal court by environmental groups, though not LEAN.

Larry Starfield, a retired top EPA official and lawyer who also advised LEAN, said that while the sensors are not the same as regulatory air monitors, they have seen great improvement in accuracy over the past decade and come at significantly lower cost than regulatory equipment.

Starfield, who spent his last 12 years at EPA as the principal deputy assistant administrator for enforcement before his retirement in 2023, said that LEAN's advance calibration work has shown the results ""are highly consistent with readings that would be expected using LDEQ's regulatory monitor.""

But he added that LEAN's intended application will fit a role that EPA says is acceptable for sensors and won't violate the new state law, highlighting instead elevated emissions in the hopes of voluntary corrections, not to allege violations of law.

""Where you have people living so close to industry, having a local, real-time, every-15-minute look at what's going on in your neighborhood in terms of air quality is just unique, and so it just gives them a chance to raise a flag and say, 'Hey, what's going on here?'"" he said.

Starfield pointed out that the earlier phase of the LEAN project that used the air monitoring car found elevated emissions and a company quickly corrected the problem after it was informed. He called it a ""different way of doing business"" than more traditional, slower methods through enforcement or litigation.

President Donald Trump’s anti-wind energy agenda is harming Louisiana businesses that form the backbone of America’s offshore oil and gas industry, which stands to lose billions if the president fulfills his campaign promise to end construction of offshore wind turbines.

In recent years, offshore leases have opened in state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind farms to be built. Wind technology has advanced, allowing for taller turbines to capture more of the Gulf region’s wind power higher up in the air. A trained workforce, built off the back of oil and gas, provided a wide base of support for the industry to expand.

On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an executive order halting construction on all offshore wind projects. The president has long expressed a dislike of wind turbines, sometimes making dubious claims that they “destroy everything,” are the “most expensive energy there is” and that they produce noise that causes cancer.

These actions and statements have slowed supply chain investments and threatened the jobs of blue-collar workers in Louisiana and nationwide, all while electricity demand is growing, in large part because of increasing numbers of large, power-hungry data centers.

There are no offshore wind projects under construction off Louisiana’s coast, but the state is deeply entwined with developments in other parts of the country. Most of the businesses working on offshore wind farms on the East Coast come from the oil and gas sector in the Gulf of Mexico.

Even without a single industrial-scale wind turbine generating electricity in Louisiana, offshore wind has so far spurred over $500 million worth of supply chain investments in the state, according to Oceantic, an offshore energy trade association with about 400 members worldwide. Almost all of Oceantic’s members work in both the wind and fossil fuel sectors, spokeswoman Stephanie Fracoeur said.

It’s the same across the Gulf South. The offshore wind sector has spurred roughly $14 billion in investments into U.S. supply chain and manufacturing companies, with nearly two-thirds coming from businesses in Republican congressional districts, according to Oceantic.

But those investments have grown risky as many offshore wind projects that were planned have been paused or scrapped altogether.

“Oil and gas hasn’t been exceptionally busy over the last decade, so offshore wind was helping keep many of these companies in business,” Francoeur said. “Unfortunately, these policy changes have put a pause on things … The federal actions have been crippling for hundreds of American businesses that were planning on this work.”

State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, represents an area of the state that has invested and made a lot of money in the wind industry. Lafourche Parish is home to shipbuilders, metal fabricators, ocean crane operators and many other companies in the offshore energy sector. Having once built and serviced the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, these businesses on the bayou were called on to do the same thing for offshore wind farms along the East Coast, Orgeron said.

Orgeron, a former Nicholls State University professor with a doctorate in experimental physics, once managed his family’s offshore vessel business and helped it expand into the wind sector. Like other companies, they didn’t abandon oil and gas; they expanded into wind energy because it offered a stable revenue stream to offset volatile fossil fuel commodity prices, he said. While an abundant oil supply and low fuel costs are good for consumers, Louisiana’s energy service sector hits the doldrums when profit margins lead exploration companies to press pause on their Gulf drilling plans.

“For 60 years, we went through economic booms and busts, and it’s just so nice to know there’s an alternative market where your identical expertise is required and appreciated,” Orgeron said. “I really don’t wanna see one of our down-the-bayou operators lose an alternative revenue stream that’s not tied to the price of oil.”

A handful of offshore wind projects are still in progress on the East Coast, where dozens of Louisiana oil-and-gas service companies are now working.

Jake Cheramie is the general manager of Encore Group, a company in Houma that provides cooks, cleaners, crane operators and other personnel to offshore work sites. Just a few years ago, all of Encore’s clientele were in the oil and gas sector, but Cheramie said Encore gravitated to East Coast wind energy development in 2021. It now encompasses roughly 20% of their business, he said.

“Most of the major vessels in lower Lafourche are up in the Northeast working now, and that’s cool to see,” Cheramie said. “It’s been good to us. I certainly don’t wanna see offshore wind go away.”

Oceantic categorizes Encore as one of many auxiliary services businesses that work for one of Louisiana’s 42 offshore energy companies that currently hold active wind contracts.

Much of the work has gone to shipyards that build vessels that specialize in offshore construction. For instance, Edison Chouest Offshore in Cut Off spearheaded construction of the $97 million Eco Edison vessel for Revolution Wind, a wind farm project off the Rhode Island coast, and other East Coast projects. That single contract, one among several others like it, employed nearly 600 Edison Chouest workers across multiple states.

About a year ago, Encore opened an office in Rhode Island to support its personnel working on the Revolution Wind project. That wind farm made headlines Aug. 22 when the Trump administration rescinded its federal permit and issued a stop-work order, citing vague national security concerns. Scheduled to come online in early 2026, the $5 billion project was about 80% complete at that time.

Revolution Wind sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge sided with the company a month later, ruling the government’s actions “arbitrary and capricious” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns.

The judge’s temporary injunction allowed the company to resume work for the time being, but the order is temporary and could change if the Trump administration succeeds on appeal. The setback has already cost Revolution Wind $77 million, according to company officials who also blamed Trump’s anti-wind policies and tariffs for increasing the cost of steel and other construction materials.

It’s a new reality that Encore and other businesses are having to grapple with. The part of their business model that was the most stable just a year ago has suddenly become shaky.

“Louisiana is going to be one of the hardest-hit areas,” Francoeur said. “Once the current projects are completed, some of those companies will have idle shipyards or idle vessels.”

Cheramie said Encore is working on other offshore wind projects in New Jersey and Virginia but worries about losing them if the Trump administration continues to target the industry. If things stay on track, Encore should have steady work for another two to three years, he said, admitting new contracts for future jobs are now hard to come by.

“There’s been quite a few projects that aren’t being permitted or may be canceled,” Cheramie said.

The pause is largely due to Trump’s executive orders, pausing all wind leases and permitting. He has followed those up with actions that have made business particularly difficult for wind and solar companies, including directing his Commerce Department to investigate the wind sector for any national security implications and directing his Interior Department to block the nation’s largest solar project, which was planned for federal land in Nevada.

“Things are likely not to move forward in the next couple of years because of the actions by the Trump administration to essentially put a pause on federal permitting for offshore projects,” said Madelyn Smith with the renewable energy industry group Southeastern Wind Coalition.

One example is RWE Wind, a German company that held the first federal wind lease off the coast of Louisiana in addition to leases on the East and West coasts. It scrapped all three projects this year and laid off 73 of its U.S. employees after Trump started his assault on the wind sector, according to a Reuters report. The company said it is focusing on onshore wind and solar for the time being while still holding onto its offshore leases.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Many Louisiana-based offshore energy businesses with wind interests refused to speak on the record for this report. The same was true for some trade groups, including the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents members in the offshore wind and fossil fuels sectors.

Orgeron said he has noticed the same pattern among some of his constituents who prefer to not say or do anything that draws attention from the White House.

“I have friends who know they’re in the crosshairs of the Trump administration,” he said. “They’re kinda in a holding pattern.”

There is one active lease in Louisiana state waters for a wind farm, according to the state Department of Energy and Conservation. The Cajun Wind project is proposed by the North American arm of Vestas, a Denmark-based renewable energy company. It’s planned off the coast of Cameron Parish and would generate enough electricity to power 144,000 Louisiana homes at peak output, according to the project’s webpage. It’s unclear when or if Vestas plans to start construction. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Diamond Offshore Wind, backed by the Mitsubishi Corp., initially planned to build a wind farm in Louisiana waters. It abandoned its lease at the beginning of 2025 but terminated its operating agreement in March.

Offshore wind farms are “enormous infrastructure projects,” Smith said. Such projects can take eight to 13 years and millions of dollars to build. Any permitting delay, political uncertainty or disruption in supply can be significant enough to chase off investors, she added.

“It has definitely given some developers pause that there have been so many changes,” she said “They are going to be looking for more stability and clarity in the federal regulatory landscape in order to move forward.”

Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said he doesn’t expect much expansion in offshore wind over the next few years unless the Trump administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which has paused offshore wind leases, reverses its current stance.

That could be detrimental for other industries that need new sources of energy to operate, such as artificial intelligence. The AI sector has been building data centers across the country that require massive amounts of power to operate, such as Meta’s proposed facility in North Louisiana. Data centers will need an estimated 22% more electricity by the end of this year and nearly three times as much in 2030, according to a report by S&P Global.

“We are facing a pretty severe energy crunch, not just in Louisiana, but nationally,” Mahan said. “Any sort of delay that we’re seeing, that is only going to hamper our energy dominance agenda.”

For the time being, many of those in Louisiana’s offshore energy sector are counting the days until the next presidential election, Orgeron said.

“Everybody’s just waiting it out until Trump leaves office,” he said. “I just hope that the president I voted for doesn’t, because of his little idiosyncrasies, destroy it completely.”

Still, the French energy giant would like to invest more in the US, where it’s already one of the largest renewable developers, and it’s also finding opportunities in other parts of the world, Clamadieu said. That includes the Middle East and India, where the focus is “on quick development” and “trying to reduce” investor risks, he said.

Under President Donald Trump, the US has scaled back tax subsidies that were supporting zero emission energy ventures. The Trump administration also has canceled permits for some renewable projects and issued stop-work orders for others.

Among the targets is SouthCoast Wind, an offshore wind farm planned near Massachusetts that’s a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie.

Article content

A federal district court dealt a blow to SouthCoast Wind earlier this week when it ruled that the Trump administration could reconsider a Biden-era permitting decision for the project. The developers are now weighing their options. They still have the underlying government offshore wind lease.

“To be frank, we aren’t expecting to develop this project at this point in time,” Clamadieu said, adding that while it’s not a good thing to wait, “it might be the reality.” Because SouthCoast isn’t as advanced as other wind farms under construction in US waters, “it offers opportunities for us to be a little bit more patient,” he said.

In the meantime, electricity demand is climbing, fed by the fast-growing AI industry and the development of power-hungry data centers essential to support it. Renewable wind and solar are key near-term sources of electricity, as new nuclear projects take years to develop and there’s a shortage of turbines for natural gas power plants.

The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time.","The world of car sales is entering a new era. There were hints of it last year, when the sales of hybrid vehicles began to explode, but now, thanks to that already-softening demand of EVs and now the lack of a federal tax credit to incentivize sales, it’s clearer than ever: EVs are on the downturn.

The proof lies in October sales, which were released earlier this week; the first round of real data shows just how important that federal incentive was. It revealed a drop of 43 percent year over year. The numbers are forcing automakers to consider whether building EVs is even worth their time. And the first casualty of that thought process could be one of the most important EVs of the 2020s: the F-150 Lightning.

What else is going on in the world? Tesla CEO Elon Musk finally got approval for his controversial $900 billion pay package, winning more than three-quarters of shareholder votes. Whether he’ll actually perform well enough to earn enough to make him the world’s first trillionaire remains to be seen, though it seems unlikely.

Then there’s Toyota, which is building V6s that grenade themselves. The company has recalled another 127,000 engines for “machining debris” that could cause total failure. Oh, and Tesla has delayed the Roadster again, this time to April Fools’ Day, 2026. Let’s get into it.

Ford Reportedly Might Not Bother With Resuscitating F-150 Lightning Production

Back in September, an aluminum plant in Oswego, New York suffered a big fire that reportedly “leveled” a key part of its facility, according to the Wall Street Journal. This plant supplied aluminum to several automakers producing cars in the U.S., with Ford reportedly being the most affected. It was the biggest user of that plant, sourcing material to build its aluminum-bodied F-150—the most popular passenger vehicle in the country.

In response to this supply chain disruption, Ford paused production of the F-150 Lightning to focus production on the more profitable, higher-demand gas-powered variants. This makes a lot of sense; the F-150 Lightning may have been the best-selling EV truck last quarter, but the 10,000 units moved are just a drop in the bucket compared to the 207,000 gas-powered F-150s sold in the same period.

With demand for electric vehicles now falling off a cliff, Ford is reportedly considering whether to restart production of the F-150 Lightning at all, according to this report from the Wall Street Journal:

Ford Motor executives are in active discussions about scrapping the electric version of its F-150 pickup, according to people familiar with the matter, which would make the money-losing truck America’s first major EV casualty.

The Lightning, once described by Ford as a modern Model T for its importance to the company, fell far short of expectations as American truck buyers skipped the electric version of the top-selling truck. Ford has racked up $13 billion in EV losses since 2023.

Overall EV sales, already falling short of expectations, are expected to plummet in the absence of government support. And big, electric pickups and SUVs are the most vulnerable.

The report goes on to say that no final decision has been made, though considering Ram made the call to cancel its yet-to-be-released EV pickup just two months ago, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Ford follow suit. The signs of reduced EV truck demand are elsewhere in the market, too. Rivian, makers of the R1T pickup, just laid off 600 people. And sales of Tesla’s electric pickup, the Cybertruck, haven’t been doing well for months.

It’s not just the F-150 that’s in danger. WSJ says General Motors executives are considering axing some electric trucks from the lineup, too, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The company builds three electric pickups right now: The Silverado EV, the Sierra EV, and the Hummer EV.

In the near future, I predict the demand for electric trucks will stay level or trickle down slightly. The truth is, most people want a gas engine in their pickups if they want to do pickup things, like towing and hauling. The proof can be seen in reservations for Scout’s new truck, where 80% of buyers want the range extender over the pure EV.

Trucks that rely on battery power alone are not the move for serious tow duty, as pulling all that extra weight zaps range to impractical levels. Plus, electric trucks are usually more expensive than their ICE-powered counterparts. Extended-range EV pickups like the new Scout and Ram’s upcoming 1500 REV have all of the same benefits as a pure EV, plus they can cover the range problem thanks to the onboard gas generator. For most buyers, it’s the logical solution.

Elon Gets His Wish. Now He Has To Make It Happen

Back in September, Tesla proposed a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that, should he accomplish a series of lofty financial benchmarks, would add nearly $900 billion to his net worth, making him the world’s first trillionaire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this proposal faced lots of criticism, seeing as how it would make Musk, already the world’s richest person, the highest-paid CEO in the history of CEOs.

Many believe Tesla’s valuation and future success hinge on Musk staying as CEO, though the South African-born exec seems to believe his most important role will be being in control of the company’s forthcoming robot army. Either way, shareholders of the automaker voted overwhelmingly to ratify the pay package, with Musk celebrating in the only way he knows how: Next to his machines. From Reuters:

The proposal was approved with over 75% support, and Musk bounded to the stage of the company’s annual meeting at its factory in Austin, Texas, accompanied by dancing robots.

Musk, already the world’s richest person, could get as much as $1 trillion in stock over the next decade, although required payments would take the value down to $878 billion.

The vote is crucial for Tesla’s future and its valuation, which hangs on Musk’s vision of making vehicles that drive themselves, creating a robotaxi network across the U.S. and selling humanoid robots, even though his far-right political rhetoric has hurt the Tesla brand this year.

“What we are about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” Musk told a cheering group of shareholders.

[…]

“Other shareholder meetings are like snoozefests, but ours are bangers,” Musk said. “I mean, look at this. This is sick.”

It’s important to note that Tesla won’t just hand Musk $878 billion over the next decade. The package requires him to accomplish some incredibly lofty tasks, including growing Tesla’s stock value by eight times, deploying a million robotaxis, selling a million humanoid robots, selling 20 million more cars, growing full self-driving subscriptions to 10 million users, and increasing operating profits to $400 billion. As I said in my previous coverage of Musk’s pay proposal, doing all of that seems pretty impossible, considering Tesla’s reputation and aging lineup.

Toyota Still Can’t Get Its V6s Right

Last year, Toyota, widely known as builders of some of the most reliable, durable, and longest-lasting vehicles on the planet, caught a lot of flak for having to replace the engines in over 100,000 trucks and SUVs equipped with the company’s relatively new 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6.

Back then, Toyota said leftover machining debris from the factory was wreaking havoc on the V6’s internals, could could lead to engine knock and total engine shutdown. The company quickly reworked its manufacturing process, saying that any engine built after those deemed potentially faulty “were manufactured with new or improved processes that better clear machining debris.”

Well, it turns out that the new process wasn’t good enough, because Toyota is recalling even more V6s for the same problem. From the company’s website:

Toyota is conducting a safety recall involving certain model year 2022-2024 Toyota Tundra, 2022-2024 Lexus LX, and 2024 Lexus GX vehicles in North America. Approximately 127,000 Toyota- and Lexus-branded vehicles (conventional gas models only) are involved in this recall in the U.S.

There is a possibility that certain machining debris may not have been cleared from the engine when it was produced. In the involved vehicles, this can lead to potential engine knocking, engine rough running, engine no start, and/or a loss of motive power. A loss of motive power while driving at higher speeds can increase the risk of a crash.

Toyota says it’s “currently developing the remedy” for this problem, though if I had to guess, it’s probably just going to replace these engines like it did with the last bad batch. If I were an owner, that’s what I’d want. Even if an engine doesn’t immediately fail due to errant metal debris, I’d worry it could be enough to cause serious damage in the long term.

Can You Believe It? The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again

In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time. This comes after reports that Musk had planned to show off the car by the end of this year. The new proposed reveal date isn’t inspiring much confidence. From TechCrunch:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.

Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.”

“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said.

In some even more upsetting news for reservation-holders of the car, Musk went on to say that production of the Roadster won’t begin until 12 to 18 months after the reveal. So, at minimum, it won’t be until April 2027 that this car hits the road—nearly an entire decade since it was first revealed.

If Musk is to be believed, the production Roadster should, at least, be pretty different from the car we saw in 2017. From TechCrunch:

Musk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.

I’ll believe it when I see it (on the road, that is).

The violations were identified following a U.S. EPA inspection that found massive methane leaks at the facility.

Despite the violations, the landfill recently won approval for a controversial expansion from Benton County.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has notified Coffin Butte Landfill’s owners it has identified seven serious violations of state and federal law at the site, most related to dangerous methane leaks.

DEQ found that the landfill’s gas collection system is not large enough to function properly and that it too often runs without an operating flare to prevent landfill gas from escaping uncombusted; that the company does not monitor for methane leaks as required, or fix methane leaks as quickly as required; and that it does not monitor for and fix tears in the surface cover.

In a pre-enforcement notice issued Nov. 6, DEQ warned owner Republic Services it may be cited and fined for the violations, and asked it to voluntarily take actions to correct the problems.

In its notice, DEQ states the company’s failure to control landfill gas emissions already has had significant environmental and public health impacts.

Phoenix-based Republic Services is the second-largest waste disposal company in the U.S. Company officials declined the Statesman Journal’s interview request.

In an emailed statement, spokeswoman Melissa Quillard said the company will work with DEQ on next steps.

“Much of the notice relates to older matters that have already been addressed"" or matters in the process of being addressed, Quillard wrote.

Quillard did not respond to a follow-up question about which violations have been or are in the process of being corrected, or what specific actions the company has taken.

DEQ’s enforcement action came more than three years after a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inspection found massive methane leaks at the facility, and less than 48 hours after the company won approval for a controversial expansion of the landfill, located just north of Corvallis.

DEQ expects to complete a formal enforcement order, with financial penalties, in early 2026, spokesman Dylan Darling said. That could also include enforceable orders to correct violations.

DEQ enforcing EPA case against Coffin Butte Landfill

Coffin Butte Landfill accepts waste from nearly two dozen Oregon counties and southwest Washington.

It takes most of Marion County’s and all of Polk County’s municipal waste, including some of the waste that previously went to the Reworld Marion incinerator in Brooks. Reworld stopped taking Marion County waste on Dec. 31, 2024.

The U.S. EPA has been investigating the landfill since its 2022 inspection. EPA monitored only a portion of the landfill and documented 61 methane exceedances, 21 of which were more than 20 times over the standard.

During a follow-up inspection in 2024, EPA again monitored only a portion of the landfill and found 41 methane exceedances.

EPA turned the case over to DEQ for enforcement in October 2025, Darling said.

EPA still could pursue its own enforcement action as well, he said.

Republic Services has repeatedly claimed, as far back as October 2023, that EPA had completed its investigation and that the company had already addressed all regulatory concerns.

Meanwhile, Republic Services has been pursuing a controversial expansion of the landfill.

Its first application for a conditional use permit to expand, in 2021, was denied unanimously by the Benton County Planning Commission.

In July 2024, the company came back with another, smaller proposal.

In July 2025, the planning commission again denied the proposal, saying the company had failed to prove the expansion would not seriously interfere with adjacent land uses, alter the character of the area or pose an undue burden on local services.

Republic Services then appealed the planning commission’s decision to the Benton County Commissioners, which decided on Nov. 4 to approve it with more than three dozen conditions.

Darling said the timing of the enforcement action was independent of the local planning decision and was based on when the case was turned over from EPA to DEQ.

DEQ identified 7 serious violations at Coffin Butte Landfill

DEQ’s pre-enforcement notice identified seven violations, all Class III, the most serious.

Two of the violations relate to methane monitoring.

DEQ found that, since 2022, Coffin Butte has exempted large areas of the landfill from required methane monitoring by claiming they were too dangerous or inaccessible to walk upon, in violation of state and federal rules.

It also found little evidence that Coffin Butte has performed remonitoring and repairs where methane exceedances were found, as required.

Four of the violations relate to the landfill’s gas collection and control system, which keeps methane and other gases from escaping to the environment.

DEQ found Coffin Butte used incorrect calculations in a 2021 amended design plan for the landfill, resulting in an undersized gas collection and control system. The company’s calculations did not include waste placed in the landfill before 1998, did not use total waste and did not use required model parameters.

DEQ found Coffin Butte failed to amend the design plan after installing a new enclosed flare in 2024.

It also found that Coffin Butte has reported extensive downtime events for its flares, but has not shut down the gas collection system during those events as required.

And it found that Coffin Butte failed to conduct monthly monitoring at each wellhead, as required. Monitoring for gauge pressure, temperature, nitrogen and oxygen help indicate the performance of the well, and results can require corrective action.

One of the violations relates to the integrity of the cover used where waste has been placed but is not at final grade. Maintaining the landfill cover helps minimize landfill gas leaks to the atmosphere.

DEQ found that while the company consistently reported conducting monthly inspections of the cover and finding no issues or holes, a 2024 EPA inspection found many holes and a significant number of trees, some of which were 3-feet tall, growing through the cover.

DEQ also noted, but didn’t identify as a violation, documented incidences of plumes of dust generated when loads are tipped into the landfill. The company’s air pollution permit requires it to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne.

Coffin Butte Landfill must hire experts, plan for drone technology

DEQ has asked the company to take the following voluntary corrective actions:

By Jan. 1, 2026:

Request a change to its air pollution permit that will allow it to use drone technology to monitor methane emissions. After the company makes the request, the process to change the permit, which includes public notice and comment, will take about six months, DEQ’s Darling said. Senate Bill 726, passed by the Oregon Legislature in June 2025, already requires Coffin Butte to use satellite, airflight or drone monitoring by Jan. 1, 2027.

Submit an operation and maintenance plan for the flare to ensure compliance.

By Feb. 1, 2026:

Submit a plan to update the landfill gas collection and control system that complies with state and federal requirements.

Have a third-party conduct an inspection of the entire landfill’s cover integrity, and submit the findings to DEQ.

Have a third-party conduct a study of fugitive dust control management and options for the landfill, and submit that along with a dust control plan, to DEQ.

Coffin Butte Landfill expansion set for final vote Nov. 17

Benton County Commissioners are scheduled to formally adopt their decision to allow the landfill to expand at a meeting beginning at 9 a.m. Nov. 17 at the county’s Kalapuya Building, at 4500 SW Research Way in Corvallis.

Opponents then will have 21 days to appeal the decision to the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals, if they choose.

LUBA’s decision can be appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals.

We have agreed on these three issues, and tomorrow we will sign a major intergovernmental nuclear energy cooperation agreement with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
This adds a whole new dimension to Hungarian-American cooperation, namely nuclear cooperation.","Péter Szijjártó, Hungary’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will sign an intergovernmental nuclear energy cooperation agreement with his American counterpart, Marco Rubio, tomorrow in Washington.

As the Hungarian minister said, “It is crucial for Hungary’s energy security to increase its nuclear energy capacities. And in order to do it, we need more nuclear fuel. Therefore, while maintaining our existing supplier relationships, we will also purchase American nuclear fuel elements for the first time in Hungarian energy history.”

“In addition, it is important that we store spent nuclear fuel elements safely, so that they cannot be harmful to the environment or health. We are purchasing the most modern American technology available, which will make it possible to store spent fuel elements safely at the Paks Nuclear Power Plant without having to transport them elsewhere,” he added.

The minister also touched on small modular reactors (SMRs) in bilateral cooperation, which will be able to cover the energy supply of a larger industrial area or city.

“So now we have these three areas: nuclear fuel elements, the proper storage of spent fuel elements, and small nuclear power plants. We have agreed on these three issues, and tomorrow we will sign a major intergovernmental nuclear energy cooperation agreement with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This adds a whole new dimension to Hungarian-American cooperation, namely nuclear cooperation. This is one of the most important agreements to be signed tomorrow.”

Péter Szijjártó also touched on the Paks expansion, reminding that this summer the Trump administration removed the Paks construction project from its sanctions list. This exemption is now valid until December. “I hope that tomorrow we will be able to agree on this, or receive a promise that the US government will extend the sanctions exemption for the Paks expansion. We have good reason to hope for this, because if they have already granted an exemption once, why wouldn’t they do so again?”

He noted that American companies are now participating in the Paks investment, as the digitisation of the Paks construction project is being carried out by an international consortium of three companies, one of which is Australian, one Hungarian, and the third American (IBM).

He noted that it is also important for the Americans to exempt Hungary from sanctions on the purchase of crude oil and natural gas.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-25-at-09.03.56.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 21:07:18.105816

As Americans’ concern about the state of the economy has grown, Trump’s has shown no interest in addressing it. He is too busy traveling the world, holding a lavish Great Gatsby party with wealthy friends at Mar-A-Lago as SNAP funding lapsed, and getting a fancy ballroom and bathroom at the White House to pay attention to the needs of American families. Trump is completely out of touch with working families, and shows no interest in addressing skyrocketing health care costs, or in ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

Rep. Don Beyer, Senior House Democrat on Congress’ Joint Economic Committee, said:

“The American people are struggling with higher prices, but Donald Trump doesn’t even want to hear about it. He could not care less.

I’m fond of saying Texas has the best business environment in the galaxy, but now we’re on track to be the best business environment in the universe.

Combined with critical legislation passed during the regular session, including a permanent extension of the R&D tax credit, robust funding in key sectors like space, semiconductors and advanced nuclear power, as well as record investment in education and infrastructure, the propositions approved by Texas voters this week stand to make the Lone Star State’s business environment even stronger, attracting even more people, companies, and entrepreneurs from across the nation and world.

Proposition 1 invests $850 million from the state’s general revenue to fund job-training programs and expansion projects at Texas State Technical College (TSTC), one of the state’s leading producers of skilled workers. This is a win not just for employers, but also for taxpayers and hardworking Texas families who stand to benefit from good-paying, stable jobs.

Proposition 2 permanently bans a state capital gains tax, ensuring Texans will no longer have to pay a tax on profits from selling any asset – including stocks, real estate, and other investments. This proposition will cement Texas’ pro-investment advantage and attract startups, venture capital, and high-growth firms that create jobs and inject massive growth into the Texas economy.

Proposition 4 creates a $1 billion annual state sales tax revenue dedication to the Texas Water Fund, starting in 2027, allowing for an allocation of up to $20 billion toward our state’s long-term water infrastructure needs – including expanding our water supply portfolio, fixing aging systems, and building flood protection projects. This proposition does not increase the current state sales tax rate but instead allows the Legislature to dedicate existing state sales tax revenues to the Texas Water Fund.

Proposition 6 prohibits the state from creating any new taxes on stock or securities trades, which protects investors and entrepreneurs and positions Texas to dominate the competition in financial services sector, particularly compared to high-tax states like New York, where the threat of re-imposing taxes on stock transactions is ever-present. This amendment makes Texas an unrivalled destination for financial institutions, brokers, and dealers, while protecting investments that support Texans’ retirement accounts and pensions from additional taxes.

Proposition 7 authorizes the Texas Legislature to enact a property tax cut for surviving spouses of fallen veterans. For families of our brave servicemembers who have made the ultimate sacrifice, Texas should relieve property tax burdens as much as possible, allowing them to keep their homes without fear of being forced to sell.

Proposition 8 bans estate, inheritance, and gift taxes, allowing family businesses and farms to grow and pass on wealth to the next generation without fear of penalty. Though Texas does not currently have an inheritance tax, this amendment ensures lawmakers cannot impose one in future legislative sessions, providing certainty and clarity for those who are carefully planning for financial stability for their children and grandchildren.

Proposition 9 eliminates the small business inventory tax and creates a $125,000 personal property tax exemption for small businesses that keep inventory – including for their products, storage, equipment, vehicles, and other property used for business operations. Under the previous ‘inventory tax,’ small business owners would have to pay taxes each year on any inventory valued at $2,500 or more. Proposition 9 was a key measure that came from our work on Governor Abbott’s Small Business Freedom Council this session.

Proposition 11 increases the school homestead exemption for seniors – Texans 65 years of age or older – and Texans with disabilities from $10,000 to $60,000, allowing greater financial flexibility for Texans who may have complex medical needs and transportation challenges, which is especially important for those who live on fixed incomes.

Proposition 14 establishes the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT) as a permanent state institution, injecting $3 billion of existing general revenue funds into dementia and neurodegenerative disease research without requiring an increase in taxes.

But before the polls even closed on Election Day, Texas was announced as the nation’s top business climate for the third year in a row by Site Selection Magazine, which cited “no corporate tax, sensible business regulations, business-dedicated courts, unbeatable logistics infrastructure and a huge labor force, among other factors” as the reason for our state’s success.

The very next day, the Texas Secretary of State’s office announced that the number of registered business entities in Texas has surpassed 3 million. Secretary Jane Nelson affirmed this milestone “demonstrates the strong confidence the business community has in our state, and there are no signs of this trend slowing down.”

By continuing to work together with our state leadership, legislators, and Texas voters who hold our state’s future in their hands, we have been able to achieve new heights in cultivating a pro-business environment that is second to none.

When it comes to creating jobs, attracting investment, and growing prosperity, Texans know that policy matters, and voters took important steps this week to ensure the Texas economy remains the envy of every other state in the nation.

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world’s most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, being showcased Friday at the COP30 climate summit, provides political support for expanding biofuels and relatively low-emission hydrogen-based fuels. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

India’s rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India’s northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

Mann said prices for sugarcane have also dropped this year. He said it’s good that the government is tackling climate change, but it should put farmers and their prices ahead of ethanol mandates.

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India’s ethanol, but that’s beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP. “With the push for E20 blends or even more, a lot more area has to be cultivated which in turn means it’ll be replacing other crops,” she said.

Balancing India’s needs

Climate experts said biofuel production can have minimal environmental impact when it’s made from waste or inedible vegetation and processed in facilities that run on clean energy. But when crops are grown explicitly for biofuels, it has a higher carbon footprint because of the fertilizer and fuel involved.

India’s ethanol strategy is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions, cut oil imports and boost agriculture, said Purva Jain, an energy specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But she said a faster transition to infrastructure for electric vehicles might be better. A 2022 study by her organization found that installing solar power for EV charging can be a much more efficient land use than growing crops for biofuel.

However, ethanol producers have invested significant sums in manufacturing and need a steady, growing market for their product now, said CK Jain, president of the Grain Ethanol Manufacturers Association. He said India should increase the percentage of ethanol mixed with gas and encourage the sale of compatible vehicles.

“We need to have higher blending as soon as possible, otherwise the industry will go into deep financial trouble,” Jain said.

Other experts advocated for a middle ground.

A 10% blend of ethanol with gasoline, can be a “win-win” solution said Natarajan of CSTEP. She said that would allow for use of existing crops without putting too much pressure on increased cultivation.

Khare, the YouTube influencer, said keeping lower blends available would help older vehicles.

“The government can bring E20 or even up to E85 programs on top of that, that’s completely fine. But consumers need to be given the option,” he said.

Today, we're diving deep into one of Detroit's biggest challenges and, possibly, its greatest opportunity: what to do with our city's vast tracts of vacant land.

Since 1950, Detroit has lost 65% of its population, creating more than 100,000 vacant lots and 18 square miles of unused land.

Right now, the city spends more than $1.3 million each year just mowing the grass on these empty parcels, among other costs.

But what if these vacant lots were transformed into something new? Parks, forests, community gardens, and green spaces that could help stabilize neighborhoods, improve health and safety, and help us adapt to a changing climate?

That's the question at the heart of the latest report from Detroit Future City: ""Saving for the Future.""

To break this all down, I'm joined by two key voices behind the report. Kimberly Faisson, Vice President for Thriving, Resilient Neighborhoods, and Sarah Hayosh, Director of Land Use and Sustainability at Detroit Future City.

We'll talk about how a dedicated land conservancy could be a game-changer for Detroit, what the research says about green space and community health, and the practical steps ahead to make this vision real.

This is one of the worst roads in Carson City.

The problem of deteriorating streets is not unique to Carson City — it's an issue municipalities across the Silver State face as the primary funding source for road construction and maintenance lags further behind the need.

How are roads funded?

All drivers of gas-powered and hybrid cars pay gas tax, which is approximately 57 cents per gallon in Washoe County, according to the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County.

Though the gas tax charged per gallon increases along with inflation, the percentage of drivers buying gas and paying gas tax is decreasing amid the green energy transition.

There was a 407% increase in electric vehicle registrations in Washoe County from June 2020 to June 2024, according to the recent 'Bridging the Gap' report from the Guinn Center, a nonpartisan think tank.

As Teslas and Rivians start to become a greater share of the vehicles on our roads, the main revenue source for road building and repairs is struggling to keep up with the cost of roadwork.

In Carson City, the gas tax dilemma has transportation officials making difficult decisions about what to prioritize. Roads like Spooner Drive may never be repaved.

""At the moment, there's no anticipated plan to replace it,"" Martinovic said.

We don't have enough money to keep up with all the needs in Carson City, so our focus tends to be keeping the roads good and the good pavement in better condition. It's cheaper to maintain than it is to reconstruct.

Policy solutions

So what can be done to address this growing problem? The Guinn Center recently commissioned a 49-page report for RTC that examined the policies passed and implemented in other U.S. states. Nevada is one of only a handful of states to not charge an additional annual registration fee on electric vehicles.

""39 states throughout the country at least charge an additional registration fee for electric vehicles,"" said Mark Krmpotic, author of the report and The Guinn Center's interim director of economic and fiscal policy.

Krmpotic told News 4-Fox 11 that of the many solutions researchers analyzed, the additional EV registration fee makes the most sense for Nevada. Fees in other states range from $50 to $250.

""The registration fee might be a fairly equitable solution. It's also less costly to implement. If you look at an agency like the Department of Motor Vehicles that currently collects the registration fee, they may not incur as much cost to implement it. And it may be a timelier implementation as well,"" he said.

Other commonly used fees might be harder to enact or less fair, he said. For example, a vehicle miles traveled tax would charge EV owners a per mile fee capped at a certain amount, but would require a third-party vendor and extensive training and programming.

Additionally, a tax on public electric vehicle charging stations is another possibility, but that option doesn't capture drivers who charge their vehicles at home.

All three policies, Krmpotic said, would require a two-thirds vote of both chambers of the Nevada legislature because they would alter the state's tax structure or raise revenue.

Legislation to charge electric vehicle owners more for road construction budgets hasn't been introduced since 2019. Senator James Settelmeyer sponsored a measure to enact a 10% surcharge on electric vehicle charging ports, with the revenue generated going to Nevada's highway fund.

Carson City's attempt

In the 2024 election, Carson City voters were asked to consider two ballot measures intended to raise revenue for road construction and maintenance.

One would've increased the sales and use tax by .25%. Another would've imposed a small supplemental government services tax on car sales. Though the measures didn't specifically single out electric vehicles, all the money generated would've been allocated to a special road fund.

Both measures failed by wide margins, with less than a third of Carson City residents voting in favor of the measures.

Possible consequences

In lieu of a solution, municipalities are left grappling with the potential consequences down the line as the transition to electric vehicles continues.

""In Carson City, it looks pretty bleak. Most roads will be similar to what we see here on Spooner,"" Martinovic said.

We've even talked about, well, what do we do for some of those rural roads? Do we grind them up and turn them back to dirt?

""Because if there's not asphalt to maintain, we don't have that cost associated with maintaining it,"" he said.

NOTABLE OBITUARIES

Eleanor “Ellie” Boda

1934 – 2025

Eleanor “Ellie” Boda, who taught generations of students as an adjunct instructor of flute at Furman, passed away on June 17, 2025.

Boda received her Bachelor of Music degree from the Eastman School of Music. She was an elementary music educator in the Greenville County, South Carolina, public schools before teaching at Furman. Boda was a longtime musician in the Greenville Symphony playing flute and piccolo, and played both in the Brevard Music Center Orchestra for many summer seasons.

Boda and her husband Dan, a professor emeritus of music, were fixtures in the Furman library and around campus and loved to travel internationally. Ellie imparted a deep appreciation for music to her students, many of whom went on to stellar careers performing and teaching music.

The couple founded the Daniel and Eleanor Boda String Player Scholarship, the Eleanor and Daniel Boda Flutist Scholarship, the Daniel and Eleanor Boda Scholarship for Orchestral Conducting and the Eleanor and Daniel Boda Scholarship for Music Education. These scholarships have been set up in perpetuity and are awarded to students annually. They will continue the Boda family legacy of keeping music and the arts alive in future generations.

Ellie, whose husband Dan died in June 2024, is survived by two children and four grandchildren.

Philip Elliott Jr.

1934 – 2024

Philip “Phil” Elliott Jr. ’56, professor emeritus of English, passed away on Oct. 23, 2024.

Elliott earned his undergraduate degree at Furman and later pursued his master’s at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Georgia and teaching at Stetson University, Clemson University and North Carolina Wesleyan University, Elliott returned to Furman and joined the faculty in 1967.

During his 32-year tenure, Elliott was known to engage colleagues and students in meaningful conversations about complex issues. His students also held him in high regard as a challenging, enthusiastic teacher. He was known to be a conscientious advisor with high standards who would lend a supportive ear.

Elliott’s publications included articles in “Victorian Poetry” and a book, “The Making of the Memoir,” first published in 1978 and reissued in 1995. The latter is considered a major work of Tennyson scholarship. Elliott served as interim chair of the English department, editor of the Furman Catalog and faculty advisor for the student newspaper, “The Paladin,” and was a valued contributor on numerous university committees.

Phil is survived by his wife, Kacky, two children, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Lon Knight Jr.

1944 – 2025

Lon Knight Jr., Charles Ezra Daniel Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, passed away on May 2, 2025.

After completing his undergraduate degree at Mercer University, Knight earned his Ph.D. from the University of Florida. He joined Furman’s faculty in 1971 and served for 48 years.

Knight was known as a consummate scholar. During his first 30 years at Furman, he averaged more than three publications per year in top journals. In 1989, Knight became the fourth recipient of the American Chemical Society Award for Research at an Undergraduate Institution and was widely recognized as one of the top scientists in the world in the field of electron spin resonance. His body of work was completed largely with the assistance of undergraduate students and with highly sophisticated instruments designed and built by Knight himself.

In 1981, Knight became chair of the chemistry department, a role he held for 33 years. Under his leadership, the department grew into one of the best equipped and most productive undergraduate chemistry programs in the country.

Knight also wrote and received multiple highly competitive grants. Of particular significance was his leadership in creating the Kresge Endowment that provides critical maintenance support for the chemistry department’s extensive equipment holdings. His key role in the design and construction of the Charles H. Townes Science Center was transformational across the sciences at Furman.

In 2006, Knight received the Alester G. Furman Jr. and Janie Earle Furman Meritorious Teaching Award. Knight retired in 2019. He is survived by his wife, Marian, three daughters and two grandchildren.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, petroleum is a fossil fuel created from ancient plants, algae, and microorganism remains buried under layers of sediment and rock.

Over millions of years, heat and pressure transformed the organic matter into crude oil and natural gas. It's a process that's well documented by geology and chemistry.

The post, shared to r/confidentlyincorrect, shows a Facebook comment about green energy that quickly went off the rails. One participant insisted that oil doesn't come from ancient plants and marine life decomposing underground over millions of years. They instead thought it ""forms naturally in the Earth's mantle.""

Commenters were quick to point out that the claim simply isn't backed by modern science.

In the 1950s, researchers explored the ""abiogenic petroleum"" theory mentioned by the OP in the comments. The theory proposes that oil is formed deep within Earth's mantle without any biological material. However, decades of data have shown that nearly all commercially extracted petroleum is biological in origin.

Modern evidence, from carbon isotopes to fossilized biomarkers, confirm that oil comes from living organisms and not deep mantle chemistry.

Knowing how petroleum actually forms matters because it helps scientists and policymakers plan for cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. The planet's oil reserves are finite. Relying on them continues to have serious health and environmental costs.

Investing in renewable energy sources helps reduce pollution and dependence on fuels that take millions of years to form.

Other Redditors registered their incredulity in the comments.

""This guy is so wrong,"" one person wrote.

As someone who has spent much of my career working to bring opportunities to Indiana’s rural communities, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of renewable energy. The conversation about wind, solar and battery storage is more than sustainability and grid diversification. It’s about more than jobs, tax revenue and keeping Indiana competitive in a rapidly changing economy. The clean-energy conversation is about how we best serve our communities, our landowners and our people.

Here in Warren County, the Jordan Creek Wind Farm has been an incredible success for keeping our government well-funded so it can better serve our residents. The project put $6.7 million into the Jordan Creek fund over the last three years for our local government. This is increasing our local tax revenue, which is funding schools, road improvements and essential services without raising property taxes on residents. Warren County’s annual operating budget for 2025 is $12.2 million. It’s easy math to see the wind farm’s immediate impact, but it’s almost impossible to believe that an energy project could do so much for us.

Clean-energy projects start generating positive outcomes for their communities as soon as they start construction, and they continue to do so for years after they begin operation.

I look at the impact that the project is having on our local generational farm landowners. In today’s economy, a corn planter can cost more than a quarter of a million dollars, and an upgrade on that machine can cost almost $100,000. The confidence that comes from knowing that the annual payment from wind farms on a farmer’s property will help offset a significant portion of those costs is remarkable.

Clean energy has the power not only to keep farms viable but also to enable them to be more profitable and to survive the current depressed grain prices. The annual land lease payment income does more than just assist in affording farm equipment. Landowners don’t have to save for years just to take a trip to see their grandchildren. That’s all thanks to the checks coming in from energy projects on their land—checks that keep coming for years over the life of a lease agreement.

These projects mean new life for rural communities that have faced decades of population decline and shrinking tax bases. During construction, these projects create hundreds of jobs, from heavy equipment operators to electricians and engineers. The operations and maintenance roles they leave behind are well-paid, stable careers that don’t require leaving your hometown. In a state where too many young people feel they have had to move away to find good jobs, renewable energy is helping keep Hoosiers at home.

We all know farming isn’t for everyone, and these types of clean-energy careers offer new options, new opportunities and new futures for those who want to stay in Indiana but can’t find an alternative vocation that allows them to support their community.

The economic benefits extend far beyond the project site. Local restaurants feed construction crews, hardware stores see more sales, and hotels stay booked. Renewable-energy development has a ripple effect that touches nearly every corner of the community.

It is frustrating that despite all these benefits, Indiana’s ability to grow its renewable energy capacity is being held back by a patchwork of local siting rules that make it unnecessarily difficult to build. Every project must navigate a maze of differing ordinances, setbacks and permitting processes under rules that can vary widely from one county to the next.

This uncertainty drives up costs, delays construction and in some cases forces projects to break ground in other states. We need a smarter approach that respects local input but also establishes clear, consistent standards that make Indiana a welcoming place for renewable investment.

Expanding our renewable-energy portfolio is more than an important step in securing a stronger Indiana; it’s a necessary one. Indiana farmers have been supporting our communities, state and country for decades, and these wind and solar farms are now starting to return the favor. Energy development gives me hope that Indiana will be able to continue its agriculture heritage long into the future.•",https://i0.wp.com/myrenewableresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MRR-Logo-150-100.png?fit=150100&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-07 21:07:12.512851

Fossil fuel production is still increasing, driving up planet-warming pollution; the United States is in climate denial mode; and turbulent geopolitics have pushed the climate crisis down the agenda and into the culture wars.

But there’s another, more hopeful, story unfolding simultaneously: the exponential rise of clean energy. Countries around the world are adding renewables at a blistering pace — and this surge is happening in some surprising places. Experts say it could herald the start of a new energy age, powered by the sun and wind.

In the first half of 2025, for the first time ever, renewables overtook coal as the top source of global electricity — a major milestone, according to analysts. How the world gets its electricity is hugely important; the energy sector is the largest source of global emissions, and clean electricity is also key to decarbonizing transportation, another heavily polluting industry.

This clean energy surge is set to increase exponentially as wind, solar and batteries become cheaper and easier to install than fossil fuels.

Global renewable power capacity is projected to double over the next five years, increasing by 4,600 gigawatts (GW) — roughly the same as adding the total power generating capacity of China, the European Union and Japan, according to a recent International Energy Agency report.

“There is no going back,” Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at climate think tank Ember, told CNN.

Yet despite the pace, some experts say much more is needed. Renewables aren’t supplanting planet-heating fossil fuels in many countries because energy demand is growing so rapidly. That means planet heating pollution levels are still rising and every bit of warming translates to more catastrophic climate outcomes.

Transforming the entire power sector to clean energy isn’t yet inevitable, said Hannah Pitt, a director at the nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group, where she oversees international energy research. “We don’t have it in the bag,” she told CNN.

Big polluters are turning to solar, even if they aren’t quitting fossil fuels yet

After spending decades pumping planet-heating carbon into the atmosphere to grow their economies, the world’s most-polluting countries are increasingly turning to clean energy. One of the big reasons is economics: renewables are getting cheaper and cheaper. Low-cost solar, in particular, is driving the clean energy boom.

China has been described as the “first electrostate.” No other country comes close on renewables; last year, it installed more wind and solar power in just one year than the total amount of renewable energy currently operating in the United States.

By the end of last year, China had installed more than 1,400 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity and it’s not stopping there; another 500 gigawatts of clean energy is currently being built.

The US, in contrast, is pulling back on renewables as President Donald Trump seeks to strangle clean energy projects, but even that hasn’t stopped the renewable energy march. Wind and solar installations account for the vast majority of new power coming online. The US ranks second globally in new solar growth after China, according to Ember data.

The current clean energy boom in the US is, in part, driven by businesses rushing to take advantage of Biden-era clean energy tax credits before they expire. But even without federal tax credits, solar, batteries and onshore wind are some of the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to install.

India, the planet’s most populous nation, is also setting new records on renewables; it is one of the leading developing countries for new solar and wind capacity, according to a report from BloombergNEF. And the EU, which has plenty of policies favoring clean energy, aims to generate nearly 43% of its energy from renewables by the end of the decade.

That’s not to say the planet’s biggest emitters have given up on fossil fuels.

In China — the world biggest climate polluter by far — new coal production reached a ten year high last year, according to one analysis. Having released a tepid climate goal for the next decade, it remains to be seen how much its emissions fall, especially as demand for power accelerates.

The US is relying more on coal-fired power, leading to an increase in its planet-heating pollution, according to Ember’s recent report, and India is turning to fossil fuels to help power its exponential growth. The EU saw a slight uptick in fossil fuel generation this year to compensate for both falling wind power generation and declining hydropower due to lingering drought.

The surprising countries that are going all out on renewables

The world’s biggest polluters matter because of their sheer size and climate footprint. But equally important, experts say, is the pollution trajectory of smaller economies — many in the global south — which are hungry for energy and growing rapidly.

There is a shift toward renewables in countries across South America, Africa, southeast Asia and the Middle East, in many cases helped by the flood of cheap solar panels, batteries and wind turbine components from China, which dominates the world in clean tech manufacturing.

“We’ve seen the world starting to benefit from that scale, enabling these emerging economies to seize the opportunity to really leap-frog into the next energy era,” said Lars Nitter Havro, who leads energy macro research at Norwegian-headquartered firm Rystad Energy.

Nepal, for example, has gone from barely having any electric vehicles just a few years ago, to EVs making up nearly 76% of all new vehicles thanks to imports of battery-powered cars from China. The Himalayan country relies heavily on clean energy, using its abundant hydropower resources to power its grid.

Some countries are pulling off stunningly fast energy transitions, adding solar so rapidly, it’s become a major source of electricity over the course of years — not decades.

Pakistan, Chile, Greece and Hungary are among those charging ahead.

A decade ago, Hungary had next to no solar power but it’s seen a rapid boom. Led by a far-right authoritarian government, the country has nevertheless encouraged rooftop and utility-scale solar through a mix of government rebates and relaxed regulations.

Chile has been installing vast amounts of solar in its remote Atacama Desert, while Greece has also seen a major boom as solar panels are installed on its Mediterranean hills and islands.

Perhaps the most startling surge is in Pakistan, which is experiencing one of the fastest solar revolutions in the world. In just six years, the share of solar in its power mix went from zero to 30%. Pakistan’s surge is “preposterous,” said Havro. “This is the tipping point. Things are starting to unfold faster than many foresaw in the past.”

However, building renewables alone isn’t the whole picture. Countries also need to work on better connecting intermittent renewables — those which work only when the sun shines or the wind blows — with batteries that can store their energy.

Some analysts caution that the coal, oil and gas aren’t going away in many places. “A lot of fossil power technologies continue to play a really meaningful role (in developing countries), even growing in our projection going through 2050,” Rhodium’s Pitt said. “Renewables have an even bigger job to do in keeping pace with that economic growth in order to really keep driving down emissions,” she added.

Rystad has a more optimistic view, because renewables are often the cheapest option. “In countries where there isn’t any entrenched pre-existing (fossil fuel) infrastructure that’s hard to replace, we do see more of a leapfrog dynamic unfolding,” Rystad’s Havro said.

Developing countries could be poised to race past the world’s biggest economies on renewables, demonstrating a new era of clean energy, said Ember’s Wiatros-Motyka. “You cannot stop it now.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2224649264.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-07 16:07:39.234630

Truth in Green Advertising: Lessons from a $1.5-Million Class Action Settlement

Kraig Jennett and Maram Salaheldin authored an article, “Truth in Green Advertising: Lessons from a $1.5-Million Class Action Settlement.”

As customers increasingly demand more sustainable products, companies understandably want to meet that demand. However, overstating or misrepresenting the sustainability of their products or services can come with a steep cost, including financial and reputational harm. Even the best intentions can face legal challenges, but adequate substantiation and legal review can help reduce the risk. This settlement offers several important lessons for companies that want to make green marketing claims about their products or services.

California to Require Food Allergen Labels on Menus by 2026

Starting in 2026, restaurant chains in California will be required to list major food allergens on their menus in a first-of-its-kind law.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill Monday, making California the first state to require allergen labeling for restaurants with 20 or more locations.

Under the new law, menus must identify items containing milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy or sesame — the most common allergens — when restaurants know or “reasonably should know” those ingredients are present. Click here to read more.

The Ubiquitous Nature of PFAS Regulation and Litigation

Ashley Buck authored an article, “The Ubiquitous Nature of PFAS Regulation and Litigation.”

Litigation surrounding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), commonly referred to as “forever chemicals,” seems to be as ubiquitous as PFAS allegedly is. Days ago, on Sept. 29, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a lawsuit brought in August 2024 by, among others, Texas farmers, which alleged the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) failure to regulate PFAS in treated sewage sludge used as fertilizer (also known as biosolids) violates federal law, namely, the Clean Water Act.

My internship was with their policy and analysis division but I worked closely with their wildlife education division as well.
I really did enjoy my internship this summer with the North Carolina Resources Commission and recommend working with them to any student looking for a place to flourish and grow.","My internship started at 10 pm the night before my first day with my roommates. We decided to go and scout out my parking spot for my first day that night because of how much first day jitters I was having. I was so nervous to start my internship at the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. I knew how important the agency was to the entirety of North Carolina. They protect and conserve our state’s wildlife and I was so excited to be a part of something bigger than myself. My internship was with their policy and analysis division but I worked closely with their wildlife education division as well. The policy and analysis division completes tasks like program development and evaluation which is what I participated in, as well as many other things such as surveys of constituents, and rule making.

The program evaluation that I worked on this summer was for their volunteer program. Before this internship I had an interest in volunteering specifically with conservation and environmental groups so when I saw the opportunity I jumped at it. This experience has shown me that I have a real passion for how our communities tie in with the greater conservation need. I want to continue to participate in volunteer programs like the one at NCWRC as part of the team behind the coordination as well as part of the team on the ground. Volunteering is a great way to connect with and give back to your community; and when you are volunteering for conservation you are giving back on an even larger scale. As for the responsibilities during my internship I worked on creating a logic model, an annotated bibliography, three interview guides, completing 24 interviews with various staff members and volunteers, and generating a final report of my findings.

At first the office aspect of my internship was hard for me to get used to because I am such an outdoorsy person. I spend most of my time out in nature so getting used to office work was something that took time. However, my supervisor and fellow interns made the office an entertaining learning environment where I built life long connections. My supervisor also set up outside of the office learning experiences for me to get out of the office and learn about different divisions and aspects of the agency. Overall I enjoyed the internship with NCWRC greatly and learned so much throughout my experience. I developed a logic model for the first time to show the agency a visual representation of how the volunteer program’s intended work leads to real conservation results. I also was able to talk to so many different people from different walks of life that gave me different perspectives on conservation. Such as how hunting and shooting sports connect to conservation which I had no previous knowledge about.

My favorite part of the internship was being able to connect with so many people on something I was really passionate about. The entire summer didn’t feel like a job because of how much enjoyment I got out of meeting and discussing conservation and volunteering with various different people. Each day was different and brought up new challenges for me to figure out and overcome, even if that challenge was figuring out the printer.

From here I learned that I may want to do something more outside for my career. However, I definitely want a career that pushes me like this internship I had and that contributes to conservation on a large scale. The feeling of knowing I was participating in something that was going to make real change felt empowering. I can see myself looking for jobs within this agency and companies like it after graduation. I really did enjoy my internship this summer with the North Carolina Resources Commission and recommend working with them to any student looking for a place to flourish and grow.",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/fer/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/11/Jenna.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 18:20:34.340268

According to rankings by Business Facilities Magazine, it secured the No. 1 spot for the third year in a row in 2025, thanks to its favorable tax environment (including no personal income tax), a large and skilled workforce, infrastructure capable of supporting growth and strong appeal to corporate expansion — more than 1,300 qualified investment projects were reported for 2024. At the same time, in the annual survey by CNBC of 2025, Texas ranked No. 2 overall, with particular strength in workforce quality and innovation metrics but scored lower in quality of life categories. In short, Texas’s consistent top tier ranking signals to businesses that it remains a highly competitive environment for growth, though states also must continue improving ancillary factors such as livability and long term infrastructure to maintain that edge.

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Campaign begins with Yam Jam, a volunteer event in Greenville that packages 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for holiday food boxes

GREENVILLE, S.C., Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That's why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

The big picture: Starting this week, Duke Energy with support from Duke Energy Foundation launches the company's annual monthlong campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities across the state.

The initiative will provide over $600,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

This year's campaign also consists of a contribution of $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: Food pantries and rainy-day funds are drained, and many are unsure when government funding will be available. Though many donors and relief efforts like the One SC Fund have stepped up to support them, many communities still need an extra hand.

Zoom in: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That's 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

Bottom line: Throughout November, Duke Energy will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others.

The monthlong campaign began Nov. 6, when Duke Energy joined Mill Village Farms, WYFF, Bon Secours Wellness Arena and nearly 200 volunteers from dozens of companies and organizations around Greenville to bag nearly 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving food boxes to be distributed by FoodShare South Carolina hubs and other food programs across South Carolina.

Additionally, Duke Energy Foundation contributed $105,000 to FoodShare South Carolina organizations across the company's service territory, including $39,000 to Mill Village Farms.

What they're saying

Dan Weidenbenner, executive director of Mill Village Farms and Mill Village Ministries: ""As we enter the holiday season, Mill Village Ministries remains steadfast in our commitment to ensuring food access for every resident in our community. In the wake of reduced federal support, Mill Village Farms' FoodShare program is stepping up to fill the gap – bringing fresh, affordable produce directly to neighborhoods where it's needed most. Thanks to the continued partnership of Duke Energy and the generosity of our community, we're able to stand in the gap for our neighbors and make sure everyone has access to the healthy food they deserve.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""Our hope is by shining a light on these organizations they will continue to receive the support they need to help address the real problem of hunger in our communities. They are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but now more than ever they cannot do it alone.""

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

After years of growth, Wood Mackenzie forecast that solar installations may decline 1% annually through 2035.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a report saying that political attacks are threatening 500 U.S. solar and energy storage projects totaling nearly 116 GW of capacity, or about half of all planned capacity additions nationwide through 2030.

“This blockade is undermining American energy security, driving up costs for families and businesses, and exacerbating the ‘energy emergency’ that the Trump administration itself declared earlier this year,” said SEIA in a press statement.

New SEIA analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects have not yet received all necessary federal, state and local permits and are at risk of being targeted by the administration. The projects, spread across 44 states, would produce enough electricity to power 16 million U.S. homes.

Solar and storage projects developed on federal lands now face “final review” from Trump-appointed Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum’s office, leaving many to be “trapped in limbo,” said SEIA.

“And this extends well beyond projects on public lands,” said SEIA. “Many solar and storage projects located partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in a myriad of federal reviews.”

SEIA said federal obstruction erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host. It poses a risk to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if your project complies with regulations the federal government can still pull the plug, said SEIA.

Eighteen states have over 50% of their planned electricity capacity at risk of being blocked. Many of these states, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada, are expected to lead the country in energy-intensive data center growth.

The cleanup — described by the EPA as “the largest lithium-ion battery cleanup in agency history"" — stems from a Jan. 16 fire that flared up at a 300-megawatt battery energy storage facility at Moss Landing just northwest of Monterey, California.

The Moss Landing 300 building, which is owned by Texas-based retail electricity and power generation company Vistra, burned for several days until Jan. 18 and saw another flareup on Feb. 18. The facility contained about 100,000 lithium-ion battery modules, 55% of which were damaged in the fire, according to the EPA.

The EPA described the work as an “unprecedented battery cleanup effort.”

“After months of careful planning and prep work by our experts to safely execute this unprecedented lithium-ion battery cleanup, the removal of potentially dangerous batteries begins,” said Mike Montgomery, EPA Pacific Southwest Region Superfund program and emergency management director.

Crews started entering the building in September to take out each battery module and individually discharge them to reduce fire risk. Materials that can be recycled will be sent to EPA-approved recyclers, including the American Battery Technology Company facility in McCarran, just east of Reno-Sparks.

In addition to preventing environmental contamination, the cleanup will allow materials to reenter the domestic battery supply chain. American Battery Technology Company’s technology, for example, will allow it to extract materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel from the battery modules.

Nevada has been pushing to build its own “lithium loop,” a circular battery economy that sources, manufactures and recycles lithium within the state.

The state’s efforts received recognition in 2023 when the Nevada lithium loop was chosen by the Biden administration as one of 31 regional tech hubs that qualify for federal funding. The University of Nevada, Reno-led Nevada Tech Hub program also received $21 million from the Department of Commerce in 2024 as part of the federal program.

The latest cleanup contract with the EPA reflects the importance of investing in battery technology development.

“This project underscores the critical need for advanced battery recycling infrastructure as the nation accelerates its transition to renewable energy,” American Battery Technology Company said in a statement.

Mitsubishi can connect you with vetted professionals who can help you determine which heat pump is right for your home.","Analysis of nearly 18,500 homes across every U.S. state found that households using electricity rather than gas for heating required significantly less energy to achieve indoor comfort.

The study, published in the Energy Policy journal, used machine learning to sift through the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, the most detailed and current set of data available on household energy use. It discovered that electric heat pumps were by far the most efficient type of heating device, particularly compared to gas furnaces.

""For the average U.S. home, this difference indicates significant savings potential on utility bills,"" wrote StudyFinds, an online outlet that dug into the new analysis.

In fact, some estimates suggest a household could save up to $1,000 each year on energy bills. That's because heating is by far the largest energy expense in most homes, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Cooling also doesn't come cheap.

Moreover, since the U.S. grid still relies heavily on dirty fuels, heating and cooling account for around 441 million tons of planet-warming carbon pollution each year.

However, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that heat pumps can slash electricity use for heating compared to furnaces and baseboard heaters by roughly 50%.

While each home's energy needs are unique, Mitsubishi offers a variety of heat pumps, including easy-to-install mini-splits for those who value design flexibility.

Even though their name may suggest otherwise, heat pumps also do more than just heat your home. They work by moving heat around, so they can keep your living space cool in the summer by transferring heat from inside your home to the outside.

If you’re among the heat-pump or EV-car-charger curious, read on for how to take advantage of the savings that are disappearing.

The Biden administration put these credits in play with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, its signature climate policy. The goal was to encourage homeowners to replace gas appliances with electric ones, which can have higher upfront price tags.

When the Trump administration pushed through the expansive legislative package, H.R. 1 last summer, the “Big Beautiful Bill” moved up the expiration date of many of the credits for heat pumps, solar and batteries, electrical panel upgrades, and more from 2032 to the end of this year.

Using gas as a fuel, in appliances like furnaces and water heaters, leads to more planet-warming emissions than using electricity, which instead powers up on California’s greening grid. Gas appliances can also pollute the air inside your home.

California also offers state incentive programs for specific regions and households, which your contractor can usually apply for on your behalf. You can enter your location and other information into the Switch Is On (check out their product and vetted vendor pages) and Rewiring America (they have a “savings calculator”) to get a sense of existing opportunities and find a contractor.

One of the biggest is TECH Clean California, which can cut thousands of dollars off the upfront cost of installing electric heat pump water heaters or heat pump HVAC systems.

Funds are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so it’s worth checking soon — reservations open periodically and often fill up within a few months.

What federal tax incentives expire on Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $2,000 off new heat pump installations

A heat pump can warm or cool a home, and a heat pump water heater warms water. The technology has been around for decades: most refrigerators are heat pumps. The appliances work by capturing heat and moving it to where it’s needed to do its job.

“Heat pumps provide heating and cooling in one appliance,” said Laura Wilson, director of marketing for The Switch Is On, a website and campaign that educates and helps homeowners transition to electric appliances.

Heat pumps are far more efficient than gas furnaces and can significantly cut a home’s carbon pollution as compared to gas furnaces.

Details: These federal tax breaks can get you 30% off of heat pump installation (labor and equipment) up to $2,000, and there are no income limitations.

Up to $600 off electrical panel upgrades

Some people may want to increase the size of their electrical panels as they electrify their homes, but this can be unnecessary, so talk to a trusted electrician.

Details: You can get 30% off the total cost up to $600.

Up to $1,200 off home weatherization

Weatherization — insulation, sealing cracks, upgrading windows and doors — helps keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and lowers monthly electricity bills.

Details: People can get 30% off of equipment (not labor) up to:

$1,200 for insulation and air sealing

$500 for exterior doors (limit $250 per door)

$600 for exterior windows and skylights

If you’re both weatherizing and upgrading your panel, the total cost cap is $1,200.

Up to $150 on a ‘home energy audit’

A building energy audit is like a “physical for your home,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Contractors take a comprehensive look at home energy use, find leaks, and recommend improvements.

Details: People can get up to $150 back.

30% off solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters and back-up batteries

This category includes rooftop solar panels and plug-in solar, which allow you to generate some of your own energy.

Back-up batteries store electricity either from the grid or solar panels. You can use that energy to power your home when the power goes out, or in the case of solar panels, at night when your solar panels are not generating electricity. Batteries must store at least three kilowatt-hours, which could power a home anywhere from 1–6 hours, to qualify.

Geothermal heat pumps heat and cool homes through a loop of piping buried underground or submerged in water, like a pond. Liquid circulates through the loop, absorbing heat from the ground in winter to warm your home and releasing heat back into the ground in summer to keep it cool.

A solar water heater uses sunlight to warm water for your home.

Details: These federal tax breaks cover 30% of total costs, without a cap.

Need-to-knows:

These tax credits reduce the amount of federal income tax you owe; they won’t give you money back beyond that. Rebates reset each year.

If you used them last year, you can take advantage of them again now.

All the work of installation should be done by Dec. 31, 2025; a signed contract for future work won’t cut it.

Many solar and battery residential contractors are reporting being booked through the end of 2025, said Josh Buswell-Charkow, deputy director at the California Solar and Storage Association.

Which federal credits can I still get after Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $1,000 off EV charger installation

If you live in what’s considered a non-urban or low-income community by the Census Bureau, you’re eligible for 30% off the total cost of installing an electric vehicle charger in your home, with a cap of $1,000.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a257ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2769x1454+0+312/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2023%2F09%2F28%2Fimg_5943-20731a0ceb48aeaba09a1bdeebba11a38851f891.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 15:01:05.060594

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.
“President Trump told me he doesn’t believe in green energy, Lula told reporters earlier this week.
Trump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.","ATHENS, Greece(AP) — U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday condemned the COP30 environmental summit as harmful and misguided — defying the global scientific consensus and concern by governments worldwide on climate change.

“It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told The Associated Press at the close of a two-day business conference in Athens. He added that he might attend next year's summit “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

Wright’s comments came as world leaders gathering over 5,000 miles away, on the edge of the Amazon in Brazil, blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for his absence from the United Nations-sponsored discussions on climate change running through Nov. 21. His remarks echoed the U.S. administration’s rejection of global climate agreements and Trump's prioritization of fossil fuels.

The U.S. will send no high-level officials to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, the White House said Friday.

“President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.

Wright led a senior U.S. delegation to Athens for talks centered on boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe and Ukraine. Among them were Interior secretary Doug Burgum, deputy secretaries and the new U.S. ambassador to Greece and close Trump ally, Kimberly Guilfoyle.

At the forum, top U.S. officials criticized European Union carbon reduction policies, arguing they undermine economic growth, democratic alliances, and global leadership in AI and energy innovation.

It was a stark contrast with the Brazilian city of Belem, where world leaders at COP30 issued urgent warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming, driven in large part by emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said a “moral failure” to act would trigger rising hunger, displacement, and environmental damage.

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.

Latin American leaders attending COP30 in Belem took swipes at Trump for his stance on climate discussions.

“Today Mr. Trump is against humanity. His absence is proof of that,” Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said in his speech on Thursday. “What should we do then? Leave him alone. Oblivion is the biggest punishment.”

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva struck a more moderate tone regarding Trump’s absence, expressing hope that his U.S. counterpart would eventually change his mind.

“President Trump told me he doesn’t believe in green energy, Lula told reporters earlier this week. “He will believe in it, because he'll realize that we don’t have much of an alternative.”

Trump wasn’t the only one staying away; the summit was also notably absent of leaders from China and India. Together, these three nations are the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Wright — a former fossil fuel executive who has been a leading voice against efforts to fight climate change — defended Washington’s stance, arguing that global gatherings should prioritize energy access, growth and technological advancement over what he described as fear-driven environmentalism.

“Gatherings of global leaders and businesses should be about humans … not on the desire to scare children and grow government power,” he told the AP in Athens. “They’ve lost the plot.”

The Belem talks opened as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, the World Meteorological Organization reported Thursday.

Trump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

At the start of his second term, Trump again withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, while the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations.

Trump created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers. Under executive orders, the EPA and other federal agencies have sought to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.

“Perhaps in no other time in history have leaders in Washington been more determined to pull the United States backwards in the fight against the climate crisis,"" Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Friday in a statement.

The Biden administration put these credits in play with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, its signature climate policy. The goal was to encourage homeowners to replace gas appliances with electric ones, which can have higher upfront price tags.

When the Trump administration pushed through the expansive legislative package, H.R. 1 last summer, the “Big Beautiful Bill” moved up the expiration date of many of the credits for heat pumps, solar and batteries, electrical panel upgrades, and more from 2032 to the end of this year.

Using gas as a fuel, in appliances like furnaces and water heaters, leads to more planet-warming emissions than using electricity, which instead powers up on California’s greening grid. Gas appliances can also pollute the air inside your home.

California also offers state incentive programs for specific regions and households, which your contractor can usually apply for on your behalf. You can enter your location and other information into the Switch Is On (check out their product and vetted vendor pages) and Rewiring America (they have a “savings calculator”) to get a sense of existing opportunities and find a contractor.

One of the biggest is TECH Clean California, which can cut thousands of dollars off the upfront cost of installing electric heat pump water heaters or heat pump HVAC systems.

Funds are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so it’s worth checking soon — reservations open periodically and often fill up within a few months.

What federal tax incentives expire on Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $2,000 off new heat pump installations

A heat pump can warm or cool a home, and a heat pump water heater warms water. The technology has been around for decades: most refrigerators are heat pumps. The appliances work by capturing heat and moving it to where it’s needed to do its job.

“Heat pumps provide heating and cooling in one appliance,” said Laura Wilson, director of marketing for The Switch Is On, a website and campaign that educates and helps homeowners transition to electric appliances.

Heat pumps are far more efficient than gas furnaces and can significantly cut a home’s carbon pollution as compared to gas furnaces.

Details: These federal tax breaks can get you 30% off of heat pump installation (labor and equipment) up to $2,000, and there are no income limitations.

Up to $600 off electrical panel upgrades

Some people may want to increase the size of their electrical panels as they electrify their homes, but this can be unnecessary, so talk to a trusted electrician.

Details: You can get 30% off the total cost up to $600.

Up to $1,200 off home weatherization

Weatherization — insulation, sealing cracks, upgrading windows and doors — helps keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and lowers monthly electricity bills.

Details: People can get 30% off of equipment (not labor) up to:

$1,200 for insulation and air sealing

$500 for exterior doors (limit $250 per door)

$600 for exterior windows and skylights

If you’re both weatherizing and upgrading your panel, the total cost cap is $1,200.

Up to $150 on a ‘home energy audit’

A building energy audit is like a “physical for your home,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Contractors take a comprehensive look at home energy use, find leaks, and recommend improvements.

Details: People can get up to $150 back.

30% off solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters and back-up batteries

This category includes rooftop solar panels and plug-in solar, which allow you to generate some of your own energy.

Back-up batteries store electricity either from the grid or solar panels. You can use that energy to power your home when the power goes out, or in the case of solar panels, at night when your solar panels are not generating electricity. Batteries must store at least three kilowatt-hours, which could power a home anywhere from 1–6 hours, to qualify.

Geothermal heat pumps heat and cool homes through a loop of piping buried underground or submerged in water, like a pond. Liquid circulates through the loop, absorbing heat from the ground in winter to warm your home and releasing heat back into the ground in summer to keep it cool.

A solar water heater uses sunlight to warm water for your home.

Details: These federal tax breaks cover 30% of total costs, without a cap.

Need-to-knows:

These tax credits reduce the amount of federal income tax you owe; they won’t give you money back beyond that. Rebates reset each year.

If you used them last year, you can take advantage of them again now.

All the work of installation should be done by Dec. 31, 2025; a signed contract for future work won’t cut it.

Many solar and battery residential contractors are reporting being booked through the end of 2025, said Josh Buswell-Charkow, deputy director at the California Solar and Storage Association.

Which federal credits can I still get after Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $1,000 off EV charger installation

If you live in what’s considered a non-urban or low-income community by the Census Bureau, you’re eligible for 30% off the total cost of installing an electric vehicle charger in your home, with a cap of $1,000.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a257ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2769x1454+0+312/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2023%2F09%2F28%2Fimg_5943-20731a0ceb48aeaba09a1bdeebba11a38851f891.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 15:01:09.018481

Data Economy Strategy is a group we created in the fall of 2024 in response to the demand that’s coming from the data economy.
In our earnings call in early August we put out a slide that shows existing data centers use quite a bit more power than they have before.
And if you look at what’s getting built, a typical data center two years ago was in the 10- to 20-MW range.
Does Constellation see itself in a leadership position, modeling how nuclear power can support the data economy?","Meta gets power, and Clinton gets an end to more than a decade of economic challenges for the 1,092 net MWe boiling water reactor that was slated to shut down in 2017 and put more than 500 plant staff out of work. Clinton is a single-unit plant, but it also has an early site permit for new construction—Constellation’s only ESP.

“Now we have revenue certainty for 20 years,” Kramer said. “And the excitement at the plant for a sustained future, the community impact, and the jobs impact was fun to be a part of.”

Jobs are back in Pennsylvania, too, where about 500 people are working at Constellation’s Crane Clean Energy Center, preparing the former Three Mile Island-1 for restart in 2027, backed by a PPA with Microsoft.

A number of other deals are “in the pipeline,” Kramer said, as he shared insights into Constellation’s strategy for meeting data-driven demand growth, getting maximum power from existing nuclear reactors, and preparing to invest in new nuclear power.

What do you do as Constellation’s VP of Data Economy Strategy?

Data Economy Strategy is a group we created in the fall of 2024 in response to the demand that’s coming from the data economy. We saw changes in the size of data centers and where they’ll be located and wanted to make sure that we were proactive in meeting that demand.

My group is responsible for a couple of things. The first is tracking deal flow for the opportunities we have to provide power solutions to data companies. A lot of what I do is making sure we understand how that’s evolving and what types of transactions are possible. You’ve seen that come to fruition in the deal we did for the Crane Clean Energy Center and also the one we celebrated at Clinton.

The second thing that I’m responsible for is market intelligence on that industry: what’s changing, how it’s changing, and what that means for energy needs, load forecasting, and other key considerations that impact not just our ability to serve those customers but also our actions related to the energy industry and Constellation’s broad business.

What gives you confidence that the demand you’re seeing now has staying power?

It’s challenging right now to get a good feel for where and when data centers are coming and to what extent they’re going to use energy on the system. What we argue is that existing data show there’s a very clear demand. In our earnings call in early August we put out a slide that shows existing data centers use quite a bit more power than they have before. And if you look at what’s getting built, a typical data center two years ago was in the 10- to 20-MW range. Those getting built today are in the 50- to 100-MW range, with some up to 1 GW.

You can tell there’s a real demand for the AI economy in the amount of spend that’s coming from the large tech companies. The most recent estimates for this year for the top four—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—are over $350 billion. Clearly a significant amount of demand is out there.

I’ve heard both you and Bryan Hanson—executive VP and chief generation officer of Constellation Energy—warn that double accounting may be at play, exaggerating data center demand. Can you explain?

Because there is a lot of activity in the industry, you have a lot of people trying to meet those needs with speculative data centers. They buy property, and typically before they even have a customer, before they have the financing to build a $10 billion data center, they have to get a utility service center interconnection. These developers are potentially putting in multiple utility service requests to see which ones move fastest, and when they get that answer, they try to turn that site into a data center.

There’s also some regulatory uncertainty. States have different policies that often change as these companies go through the building process. Companies trying to figure out where they can get power fastest and most reliably end up weighing some different options.

Utilities are having a hard time parsing these speculative requests. They’re doing their best and trying to add requirements—whether that’s additional financial requirements or details on customer arrangements—but you can’t get too far down that path if you don’t know when you’re going to be able to get those customers power.

In our business, the location matters quite a bit because if it all gets built in one place, that changes the way you plan from an infrastructure perspective. I appreciate all the work that’s happening on the utility front and with the RTOs [regional transmission organizations] trying to figure out better ways to do this. But it’s difficult to figure out how much demand is coming to an individual location. To the extent we know where the end-use customers are, that’s helpful. Our deals have been with big tech companies because we know there’s an end-use customer.

How has it been working with hyperscalers, specifically on the Microsoft and the Meta deals?

We’ve always had good relationships with those customers. Constellation serves three-quarters of the Fortune 100, so working with hyperscalers is not new from our perspective.

I’d say there are two things that are interesting about working with those customers. First, they have very good sustainability goals. They’ve been vocal and we’ve heard repeatedly that nuclear is a good fit with what they’re trying to accomplish from a sustainability perspective.

The second thing is their long-term perspective. Typically in competitive markets a customer might be looking for a short-term deal for two or three years of power. Getting long-term revenue certainty from hyperscalers has been super helpful, because we are making long-term investments at these sites.

Constellation is competing with other power producers to land the best deals and with new reactor developers offering to site smaller reactors at the point of need. How is Constellation marketing its fleet of larger reactors that were sited decades ago?

I think there are a couple of things that are important in this question. The first is it does take a long time to get new things built. With these needs coming in the near term, you have to figure out what you can do in the existing system.

The first priority is making sure that the existing fleet has some revenue certainty and we can extend the license lives of the existing assets. We have a number of plants that are coming up on their license renewal dates. We’re trying to figure out how to renew those licenses and make the long-term investments required to operate those plants at the safe and reliable levels that we’re used to. That was a big part of the deal we did at Clinton. Clinton’s license expires in 2027, and this allows us to extend it and renew the license for another 20 years.

Renewing those licenses and having revenue certainty for a period of time allows you to consider how you add new capacity to units. Uprating is one way to get additional capacity, but that is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Some units are candidates for considerable uprates, while others have less potential and some have already done all possible uprates. What we’ve said is that we have about a gigawatt’s worth of additional uprates we can do across our fleet, pending some customer commitments. We’re working toward getting those on the system, which is faster than building new capacity.

Where—and when—does new capacity come into the picture?

One option is restarting existing reactors that have shut down. There’s only a handful of those across the country, of course, so that’s not a sustainable solution, but it does get us—in the case of the Crane Clean Energy Center—an 835-MW pickup by 2027. Between the gigawatt’s worth of uprates and the 835 MW at Crane, we’re adding the equivalent of about two large reactors to the existing fleet.

By having existing assets run for an additional 20 years, we also preserve great locations for new builds. At those locations, you have existing infrastructure, community support, and good technical people who live in those areas and are capable of supporting new builds. When it comes to getting new generation built in the U.S., one of the best places to do that is at an existing reactor site.

Constellation has said the deal with Meta opens the possibility of building a new reactor at Clinton. Is new generation incentivized? Could it be folded into the PPA with Meta if and when it’s built?

We haven’t disclosed any details on how that would work, but it is something that is of interest, and we’re exploring that opportunity.

Returning to Constellation’s planned uprates, licensing timeline changes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission mean you can likely get NRC approval for those uprates quicker than you could last year. Will this allow Constellation to turn planned uprates around faster?

The short answer to your question is that for those that are regulatory driven, I agree that you can probably pull some of the regulatory work to the left. The real question is the physical work that needs to happen. The supply chain considerations for large equipment that generally come with some of the bigger uprates are probably constrained by those equipment challenges and not by other things.

We haven’t disclosed specifics on many of the uprates. The only ones that we’ve talked about publicly are the turbines that we’re doing at Braidwood and Byron—those projects are underway—and we expect to get 30 MWe from uprates at Clinton. We announced as part of the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit in July that we have a potential uprate at Limerick. That is an extended power uprate that includes some pretty long-lead-time equipment. We’ve already started thinking about how to make sure that we can meet the timelines that we have planned, for example, by either having those components on order or by working through the engineering and design on those projects.

What are some other ways Constellation is trying to meet growing demand with its existing assets, such as demand response tools or battery storage?

Demand response is definitely something that we are working on. We are partnering with a company called Grid Beyond to work through how to focus on getting more demand response on the system and working through solutions for our customers to aggregate and potentially use that as a means to help offset some of the concerns that exist today around peak and reliability challenges.

From a battery storage perspective, we have evaluated that and continue to evaluate where we can potentially play in that space. We are in the process of acquiring Calpine, which does have some battery storage assets. We can’t really talk too much about what we’re doing with Calpine assets until that deal closes for legal purposes, so I’ll just leave it at that.

Nuclear plants do best with a stable, predictable load, but data center loads can fluctuate, especially when they’re serving generative AI. What are the challenges to integrating the power supply and the load and protecting your nuclear assets?

Yeah, it’s a really good question. I’m not an engineer, so I’ll give you my nontechnical answer. I would frame it by saying a lot of the data centers getting built today are on the grid. All our deals so far have been front-of-the-meter PPAs. They’re not directly connected to the plant, so the load variability that you see coming from potential data centers gets managed like every other load variability. There have been some studies about how to do that best, knowing that we could be seeing some significant variability in size relative to what exists on the grid today. A lot of people are working on the solutions to that problem.

The second thing that’s interesting, at least from my perspective, is that those problems are also being considered in the design of racks in the data centers. They’re designing racks to balance some of the compute variability by looking at workloads both in terms of when they happen and from a power conductibility standpoint. NVIDIA in particular just came out with their latest rack design that includes some balancing components to space out some of the load.

Through the Electric Power Research Institute’s DCFlex project, we’re working with the hyperscalers, the generators, and the utilities, trying to figure out ways in which we can have more flexible data centers to support peak load and manage the compute in a different manner to protect the grid or protect the generators.

I think the approach to integrating the grid and the load is a combination of those two things: the macro scale of using the grid and the balancing effect that comes from more resources, and the micro scale of how the data center itself operates.

We at Constellation are not the ones managing the transmission and distribution system and we’re not the ones dealing with the data center build-out design work itself. But I’m involved in understanding how the other stakeholders are trying to work through that. And I think they are all coming up with different solutions that will hopefully avoid any concerns there.

Understanding that Constellation first wants to get maximum value out of its existing assets, what is the plan for new nuclear builds?

There’s definitely a need for new nuclear, and there is a role for us to play. The short answer to your question is that there is a lot of activity in the space and people are working on different solutions.

Trying to figure out which solutions you can scale quickly from first-of-a-kind to nth-of-a-kind has been a priority. We’re figuring out how we can help facilitate that, potentially with projects at our existing sites or in terms of support from a technology development perspective, and we’re looking at ways we’ve done that in the past. Getting a better understanding of how we can move those quickly down that cost curve is really our effort in terms of getting new build.

Does that include looking at new ways of collaborating with end users on siting, offtakes, or operation, for example?

The answer is yes. I can’t go into detail, but yes, we talk to customers on a regular basis about the potential for new nuclear, where facilities might be located, how we think about the offtake agreements, how we think about risk sharing—all of those are part of the discussions. Individual discussions are all confidential, so I can’t really get into those details.

Similarly, on the construction side, thinking through potential folks we can partner with is something that we’ve had a lot of conversations on. There’s been a lot of activity there, but not a lot that we can talk about in specifics at this time.

What does Constellation like about what it sees in current policy and legislation and what are you looking for more certainty on?

I think the thing that we like and that has been very clear is the bipartisan support for nuclear. You saw that with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the way in which it treated nuclear and kept those tax credits for both the existing nuclear fleet with the 45U [production] tax credit, but then also in the way in which new nuclear gets treated under the 45Y [production] or the 48E [investment] tax credits.

We are getting a lot of support from the administration and from the Democrats. Seeing both of those groups come together behind a type of technology, and nuclear in particular, has been something that we’re super proud of.

That said, it’s hard to get new reactors built. There are a lot of people working in the administration on ways in which we can put all that together. Making sure that there’s the right level of risk sharing and protection for the companies that want to take that on and figuring out market design elements that will help are some of the biggest issues from a policy support standpoint.

It’s very exciting to be part of this industry today, and advocacy is still important despite the bipartisan support. I think it doesn’t hurt to continue to educate folks on the benefits of nuclear and the attributes that it provides to the system.

Does Constellation see itself in a leadership position, modeling how nuclear power can support the data economy?

Yes, I would say definitely we see ourselves as a leader in the industry and we want to stay in that position. We have a role to play in both making sure the existing fleet runs for as long as possible and runs at excellent levels. Where new nuclear can be added we have a role as well.

So, I would say yes, we certainly want to be a big player as it relates to how we participate and also in terms of thought leadership, which requires a lot of effort from the industry. We work closely with a lot of industry partners trying to figure out the best ways to do that and how Constellation can contribute.",https://www.ans.org/file/22003/l/Crane Turbine.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 17:59:16.450591

The DOE issued these grants under the Biden Administration, many of which were made in the last few months of the Administration. Most of these revoked grants were for spending on “green” energy projects or funded energy advocacy groups. Below are a few of the most wasteful projects and groups the Biden DOE funded which have since been canceled.

Community Environmental Council (CEC) – $2 Million

The DOE granted $2 million for the CEC to promote climate workshops and environmental education initiatives. CEC is an advocacy organization that promotes climate activism rather than education. They sponsor community climate resilience hubs that “consider socioeconomic inequities and structural racism” as essential for environmental efforts. Taxpayer funds should not go to climate justice advocacy that leads to energy forced transitions to unreliable energy resources.

United States Green Building Council (USGBC) – $3.8 Million

This $3.8 million dollar DOE grant explicitly went towards creating “equitable building performance standards” in California. The USBGC is already dedicated to implementing the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design green building rating system. This system, created and run by the USGBC, focuses on promoting zero-carbon buildings based on a sustainability point system that developers follow to receive tax breaks in some states. The equitable building performance standards “applies an equity lens to each credit within the rating system”.

Rather than allowing the market to drive innovation and efficiency, this grant subsidized a subjective “equity-based” framework that distorts incentives and forces developers to prioritize political goals over affordability and economic growth.

ARCHES H2 LLC (California hydrogen hub) – $1.2 Billion

Through a 2023 Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations grant, the DOE gave $1.2 billion dollars for the development of a California hydrogen hub that would replace current baseload power sources. Baseload power is the minimum level of continuous electricity supply needed to meet consistent energy demand. It is typically provided by reliable, always-on sources such as coal, nuclear, or natural gas plants that operate steadily to ensure grid stability. Hydrogen hubs waste large amounts of electricity during production, storage, and use, which drives up system costs and strains the power grid rather than supporting it.

SunPower Corporation – $6.65 Million

Biden’s DOE gave almost $7 million to build “zero-energy-ready” homes with rooftop solar and a community battery storage facility. Paying a commercial solar vendor $6.65 million dollars of public money to develop solar powered housing communities is industrial policy, not energy development. The public should not bankroll the development of inefficient solar communities and certainly not by subsidizing the solar corporations that stand to profit from them.

Plug In America – $5 Million

The DOE contributed $5 million to EV education initiatives by Plug in America. Participants learned about the benefits of EVs and how to receive tax credits for purchasing one. This is an advocacy group, not an energy producer or developer. They organize and sponsor groups that aim to accelerate EV adoption including on campus EV support groups. Public money should not fund campaigns to accelerate EV adoption.

EV Right of Way Project in Portland – $1.78 Million

This $1.78 million DOE grant funded an initiative to place EV chargers on curbs and power poles next to city streets. Specifically, in areas that are predominantly “low-income and communities of color”.

Taxpayer dollars should not go towards funding the social justice agenda of Portland.

The Political Economy of Power

These projects are not only costly and ineffective, but also fund causes that are not in line with the priorities of the American people. Americans want reliable, affordable energy and subsidies for renewables do not deliver that. Solar and wind power depend entirely on weather conditions, such as sunlight and wind that cannot be summoned on demand, making them non-dispatchable and therefore unreliable sources of energy. They cannot provide power when it is needed most, forcing utilities to maintain backup systems powered by fossil fuels or nuclear energy or else be unable to supply power when demand peaks. By subsidizing these projects, American consumers receive more expensive energy with less reliability.

In an attempt to reduce these costs, the government often subsidizes green energy projects through grants or tax credits. However, government subsidies create more problems than they solve. Instead of fostering genuine innovation, subsidies prop up technologies that cannot compete on their own merit, distorting market signals and discouraging private investment in more efficient solutions.

When the government guarantees profit through tax credits, grants, and mandates, companies are rewarded for political connections and compliance rather than performance and innovation. This results in wasted taxpayer dollars, inflated project costs, and an energy sector that becomes dependent on continual government support. Worse still, once subsidies are introduced, industries rarely wean off them, creating long-term fiscal liabilities without delivering the promised environmental or economic benefits.

Towards Principled Energy Policy

The DOE’s revocation of wasteful Biden-era grants during the shutdown has exposed that billions in taxpayer money was being funneled into advocacy groups, green lobbying efforts, and projects that do not strengthen America’s energy system.

This moment offers lawmakers a clear opportunity to redirect federal spending away from politically motivated initiatives. Future funding must prioritize energy reliability, affordability, and national security, with strict oversight to prevent taxpayer dollars from being misused again. By doing so, policymakers can rebuild trust, protect public funds, and ensure America’s energy policy serves the people rather than special interests.",https://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/alex-shuper-JrUR-ra9bsM-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:06:04.909299

Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger will become Virginia’s new governor after a decisive win this week — and after a campaign that centered around rising power prices in the data-center capital of the world.

With Spanberger’s win, Democrats now control all branches of the state government. Virginia Democrats added more than a dozen seats to their majority in the House of Delegates on Tuesday; the Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t face an election.

That outcome may be a game-changer when it comes to preserving and enforcing the Virginia Clean Economy Act. Passed in 2020, the law requires top utilities Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power to achieve 100% renewable power production in the coming decades. Virginia’s Republican delegates and current Gov. Glenn Youngkin have blamed the legislation for rising power prices and pushed to repeal it, while state regulators have approved Dominion’s plans to build a raft of new gas plants in spite of the law.

The Clean Economy Act remains divisive even among Virginia Democrats. Spanberger has said that she’s committed to its long-term goals and to scaling up clean energy generation. But Democratic House Speaker Don Scott was reluctant to get into details about its future in a press conference this week, and didn’t deny the possibility of weakening its fossil-fuel restrictions, Inside Climate News reports.

The trifecta could also pave the way for Virginia to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a collaborative of East Coast states that requires power generators to meet a set cap on carbon emissions or buy allowances to exceed it. States reinvest those proceeds into emissions-reducing projects and clean energy. Youngkin pulled Virginia out of the partnership two years ago, but Spanberger has promised to rejoin.

But there’s one piece of the clean-energy landscape where Spanberger’s win could be more problem than solution. Dominion is currently building what will be the country’s largest offshore wind farm, with support from Youngkin. That Republican backing could be why the Trump administration hasn’t targeted the Dominion array, while at the same time dealing blow after blow to offshore wind projects in blue states.

More big energy stories

Climate action wins in elections big and small

It wasn’t just Virginia: Democrats swept statewide races across the country this week. In New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill campaigned on a promise to rein in rising power prices, and, in contrast to her Republican opponent, showed support for offshore wind. Still, the state has no operational or under-construction offshore wind projects, and Sherrill will have limited power to counteract the Trump administration’s anti-wind policies, Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler reports.

In Georgia, Democrats beat Republican incumbents in two elections widely seen as referendums on rising utility bills. Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson will now take seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, which oversees for-profit utilities and their requests to raise rates. And in New York City, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani — who tied climate action into his affordability-focused campaign — won the mayoral race.

Several other smaller races also have energy implications. Here are the results of a few:

The Minneapolis City Council held on to a majority of progressive officials who have clashed with Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey, including by overriding his veto of a local carbon-emissions fee.

Wise County, Virginia, voted against creating a local electric authority that would exclusively handle large customers like data centers, with one advocate saying the authority would be ​“a gift to big profitable corporations.”

Clean energy carries on

As the world prepares to meet in Brazil next week for the COP30 climate conference (sans the Trump administration), new reports show that clean-energy progress is still happening in defiance of White House opposition.

BloombergNEF took a look at the impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which rolled back federal incentives for clean energy. The legislation will slow solar, wind, and storage deployment over the next few years, BloombergNEF predicts, but growing power demand will ultimately lead renewables to rebound after 2028.

And while the world remains far off track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, it’s still making progress. A United Nations report projects the impact of many countries’ new, bolstered emissions-reduction commitments, and finds they’ll limit warming to around 2.5°C this century if fully implemented. It’s not ideal, but it’s still a win from previous reports that forecast as much as 5°C of warming through 2100.

Unfortunately, the COP30 hosts have hired a public relations firm that represents fossil fuel companies—and not for the first time.","As nations gather in Belém, Brazil for the international climate negotiations (known as COP30), the fossil fuel industry is emboldened and empowered by its dominant influence over the Trump Administration. At the same time, there is growing momentum to hold this industry accountable for its deception and the massive damage caused by its products and business model. With the world in danger of breaching 1.5° C of global warming and the Trump administration not sending a high-level delegation (having announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement for the second time), COP30 will be a pivotal moment in global efforts to limit the worst impacts of climate change and advance a just transition centering workers, communities, and Indigenous Peoples.

Despite the commitment made two years ago at COP28 in Dubai to transition away from fossil fuels, the 2025 Production Gap Report shows that nations’ fossil fuel production plans are on track to be twice as much in 2030 as would be consistent with a 1.5° C pathway. And the annual Emissions Gap Report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) found that none of the more than 60 countries that have submitted pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions have included targets to reduce oil and gas production or phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.

Fossil fuel industry obstruction is one key explanation for this glaring omission. Just as the tobacco industry has a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest with public health policymaking, the fossil fuel industry has a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest with the development and implementation of public policies intended to limit fossil fuel-driven climate change and accelerate the transition to clean renewable energy.

What would it look like if the nations of the world came together to prevent the fossil fuel industry from obstructing science-informed public policy and its implementation? I decided to imagine what a COP free from fossil fuel industry influence would look like.

Safeguards against conflicts of interest

Since 2023, when COP delegates were first required to disclose their affiliations, the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition has counted thousands of fossil fuel lobbyists granted access to the negotiations. The industry’s presence has outnumbered the size of delegations of most nations—and eclipsed the representation of the most climate-vulnerable nations.

CEOs and lobbyists from BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and other major fossil fuel corporations have no place at the table where climate goals are being set and the transition to clean energy is being planned. An important new study underscores Big Oil’s conflict of interest: the largest 250 oil and gas companies only own about 1.42% of the global renewable energy capacity in operation, and may only produce 0.1% of their primary energy from renewable sources. The bottom line: these companies’ actual investment in clean energy is negligible compared to their massive fossil fuel extraction.

In a COP safeguarded against conflicts of interest, the nations most affected by extreme heat, sea level rise, and other climate impacts would not have to worry about their voices being drowned out by lobbyists from the industry primarily responsible for destructive and deadly climate change.

Science-informed decisionmaking

COP relies on science, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to inform its decisions. Even as the latest IPCC plenary meeting stalled on some key issues, the science is clear: climate action is far off track.

Of particular relevance to holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the climate crisis is attribution science, which is rapidly advancing—despite attacks from climate science deniers tied to fossil fuel interests. Here are a few recent examples:

A peer-reviewed study led by my former UCS colleague Dr. Shaina Sadai built on and extended earlier research by quantifying not only the historical but also the long-term future contributions of major fossil fuel companies to sea level rise.

A new study published in Nature presents the first systematic attribution of extreme heat events to the emissions of 180 fossil fuel and cement producers. Analyzing 213 major heatwaves that occurred between 2000 and 2023, the authors found that emissions traced to the major carbon producers account for roughly half of the observed increase in heatwave intensity since preindustrial times.

Another 2025 Nature study provides a robust scientific basis for climate liability claims. Using an “end-to-end” attribution framework, the researchers link emissions from individual fossil fuel companies to specific economic harms caused by extreme heat between 1991 and 2020. For example, emissions traced to Chevron are associated with between $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in global heat-related losses.

Attribution science is showing how specific emissions have driven today’s climate impacts. In a fossil-free COP, this evidence would help shape policies rooted in evidence and fairness, not industry influence.

Polluter pays principle

Finance for cutting emissions, adaptation, and loss and damage remains a central issue in the COP process. Last year’s COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, failed to deliver an ambitious and much-needed climate finance commitment from richer nations for lower income countries.

Fossil fuel interests permeated COP29, and their push to maintain massive profits from oil and gas showed in the flawed final outcome. The final COP29 finance text made no explicit reference to the “polluter pays principle,” phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, or cutting investment flows to fossil fuels.

According to the 2025 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change, the health threats of climate change have reached unprecedented levels and “The escalating economic costs of climate change are becoming ever more visible, with profound implications for human health and societal stability.” To rebuild trust, wealthy nations that have built their economic power on fossil fuels must demonstrate their commitment to climate justice—which includes stepping up climate finance and making fossil fuel polluters pay an equitable share of the costs of:

climate damages;

climate adaptation; and

the environmental, social, and systemic impacts of fossil fuel products and production.

This is the first COP after two landmark international court rulings that affirmed the right to a healthy climate and clarified that climate inaction is a violation of international law and that nations must regulate fossil fuel companies.

Climate justice means nations should ensure access to judicial remedies, including for extraterritorial climate impacts resulting from actions that occur within their borders or under their jurisdiction. Survivors of Super Typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette), which struck the Philippines in 2021, have announced legal action in the United Kingdom against Shell, seeking compensation for deaths and damages linked to the company’s role in driving the climate crisis. The survivors argue that Shell violated the Philippine constitutional right to a healthy environment and continued expanding fossil fuel operations despite internal documents acknowledging the catastrophic risks of climate change.

International cooperation for climate justice and accountability is especially vital now as the fossil fuel industry wields its influence with the Trump administration and the US Congress to lobby for a shield from liability for the harm caused by its products and business model.

Transparency and fair accounting

Disclosure and transparency are essential to the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective climate policies at all levels, from subnational to international. Seizing the advantage of a friendly US administration and Congress, fossil fuel corporations and their surrogates are attacking climate disclosure rules and attempting to shift how global warming emissions are calculated in an effort to dodge responsibility.

ExxonMobil, for example, lobbied aggressively against the European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, a landmark law aimed at holding corporations accountable for human rights violations, environmental harms, and climate impacts in global supply chains. CEO Darren Woods has now leveraged his access to President Trump in an effort to defang the law before it takes effect.

At the same time, ExxonMobil is suing to block California’s agenda-setting climate disclosure laws, as my colleague Laura Peterson writes in her latest blog. Enacted in 2023, California’s laws require, among other provisions, disclosure of Scope 3 emissions.

Woods and ExxonMobil have also undertaken a crusade to change how Scope 3 emissions are calculated. Scope 3 encompasses emissions up and down a company’s value chain, including those produced from burning the company’s products—around 90% of the total for an oil and gas company. (The Trump administration is going a step farther, proposing a rule that would eliminate requirements for measuring and reporting carbon emissions for the vast majority of US industries, including fossil fuel producers and refiners).

Heading into COP30, ExxonMobil and the International Chamber of Commerce are among those kicking off a campaign to change carbon accounting. This system is favored by the oil and gas industry because it would shift responsibility for emissions from sold products from companies to consumers.

Information integrity

In the absence of transparency, disinformation can flourish. That’s why putting information integrity on the agenda at international climate meetings this year is a major breakthrough, as my colleague Kate Cell explains. November 12 is an official thematic day on information integrity, a cross-cutting objective on the Action Agenda of COP30.

The fossil fuel industry has been a key driver and beneficiary of disinformation and delayed climate action, as documented in the latest report by my team at the Union of Concerned Scientists, Decades of Deceit: The Case Against Major Fossil Fuel Companies for Climate Fraud and Damages.

Another compelling new resource is Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment, which brought together nearly one hundred scholars and experts to advance our understanding of efforts by organized interests to slow or block policies on climate change. To equip actors to better recognize, anticipate, and respond to efforts that could undermine climate ambition, the Climate Social Science Network has published a policy brief on Climate Obstruction in the UN FCCC.

An international commitment to information integrity can support implementation and enforcement at the national level. Climate advocates are already seeing some success through litigation against greenwashing:

Advocates in New Zealand recently secured a public apology from Z Energy after legal action. The petroleum retailer took out full-page ads in newspapers apologizing for “any confusion” caused by a greenwashing 2022 PR campaign that misrepresented its focus on alternative fuels and emissions reductions.

A French court ruled that TotalEnergies misled the public with false claims about its path to carbon neutrality, marking the first use of France’s anti-greenwashing law against an energy company. The decision requires the company to remove misleading statements from its website and pay damages to the environmental groups that brought the case, signaling growing legal scrutiny of corporate climate claims in Europe.

Unfortunately, the COP30 hosts have hired a public relations firm that represents fossil fuel companies—and not for the first time. With this conflict of interest baked in, there is a real risk that the fossil fuel industry’s role in the climate crisis could be whitewashed—and the results of COP30 negotiations could be greenwashed.

Holding the line in Belém

On its own, a fossil-free COP process won’t solve the climate crisis or secure a people-centered just transition to a future rooted in rights, fairness, equity and solidarity. National and subnational policymakers, litigators, investors, business partners, communities, workers, Indigenous Peoples, consumers, and (of course) scientists all have key roles to play.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Blog-Thumbnail-Kick-Big-Polluters-Out.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 17:04:52.364884

A new nuclear partnership

Independent power producer Brookfield Renewable Partners celebrated a recently-announced $80 billion partnership between Westinghouse Electric, of which it owns 51%, and the U.S. government to deploy nuclear reactors during a third-quarter earnings call this week.

Westinghouse Electric is the U.S.-based developer of the AP1000 nuclear reactor design. Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, owns the other 49% of Westinghouse.

Though the U.S. government has yet to make a final investment decision, the agreement reportedly includes a profit-sharing arrangement that Brookfield Renewable Partners co-President Jen Mazin said on Wednesday could produce $17.5 billion of upside for the organization. She said the deal has already spurred customer interest in AP1000 technology and suggested it could position Westinghouse as a top nuclear vendor outside the United States.

“[The deal positions] Westinghouse to far exceed our original underwriting expectations, and deliver significant value for our shareholders and over the long term,” she said.

Brookfield Renewable Partnersis a Canadian limited partnership that is majority-owned by Brookfield Asset Management, an alternative asset manager with more than $1 trillion under management. Its third-quarter investor update reveals 48.7 GW of operating capacity with annualized generation of approximately 127,000 GWh and a development pipeline of more than 200 GW. Ninety-seven percent of its portfolio is in renewables, including both firm (hydropower) and intermittent (wind, solar) assets.

Brookfield could begin booking revenue from the U.S. government deal “as quickly as the next couple quarters,” though its earnings during early-stage development would likely be “modest,” said Connor Teskey, president of Brookfield Asset Management.

In the third quarter, Brookfield reported 9% year over year revenue growth, 38% growth in generating capacity and 40% growth in actual generation. A mix of asset acquisitions and new commercial deployments drove the generation increase.

Movement on V.C. Summer construction restart

Also last month, Brookfield signed a letter of intent to look into restarting construction on the unfinished AP1000 reactors at the V.C. Summer generating station in South Carolina.

Former project partners Santee Cooper and South Carolina Electric & Gas — now owned by Dominion Energy — abandoned construction in 2017 as costs escalated and Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy.

The fiasco left South Carolina ratepayers on the hook for billions, but Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton insisted last month that completing the reactors now would have “no additional financial risks for our customers at all.”

If Brookfield decides to move forward after a six-week due diligence process, the company could officially take over construction, select a project manager and pursue agreements with power offtakers, The State newspaper reported last month.

On Wednesday, Teskey sounded optimistic about the project while cautioning that it was still early in the process.

“We are encouraged by our initial feedback from potential partners and hyperscaler off-takers,” he said, adding that the project could position Brookfield as a supplier of bulk nuclear power to utilities and large corporate offtakers.

“But we will only do so if the appropriate downside protections and risk adjusted returns are available to us,” he added.

Notable corporate power procurements

Teskey also sounded upbeat about offtake and revenue opportunities for Brookfield’s large hydropower portfolio. The organization has five terawatt-hours of hydro assets coming up for recontracting, he said, just as hyperscalers are “seeking long-term access to reliable and sustainable energy sources to power this growth.”

In July, Google said it would buy up to 3 GW of hydropower from Brookfield, beginning with 670 MW from the Holtwood and Safe Harbor dams in the PJM Interconnection. Brookfield is in the process of relicensing both dams, a time-consuming process that committed offtake deals can make easier.

More recently, Brookfield signed a similar agreement with Microsoft for a third hydropower facility in PJM, Teskey said. He suggested more deals are in the offing.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Wu-iHKUdaVIVxwJmsETeqRcwT0tTqcHegB99I0PqJPY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8xOTIwcHgtSG9sdHdvb2RfRGFtX0FlcmlhbC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-07 14:07:30.702653

1. How virtual power plants could meet data centre energy demand — The Financial Times

Rocky Mountain Institute just released a report on virtual power plants (networks of distributed energy assets like solar panels, batteries and smart thermostats) that shows they can provide energy flexibility to meet data center energy demand without increasing electricity bills for Americans.

The report estimates they can expand to meet more than 20% of peak US demand in 2030 and reach a market size that covers projected data center growth, by shifting demand during peak periods. By helping shift demand away from the peaks, VPPs can be a much cheaper alternative to building whole new power plants, which can take years to build or connect to the grid.

2. White House Fossil Fuel Bet Is Losing to Green Energy — Bloomberg

Despite Trump’s efforts to weaken wind and solar initiatives, investment keeps pouring into clean power. According to BloombergNEF, in the first half of 2025, global investment in new renewable energy projects reached a record $386 billion. As much as $56 billion from private and public investors worldwide went into cleantech companies ranging from storage to EVs by September. That exceeds the entire $51 billion invested in cleantech companies during 2024.

Investment in clean energy has also pulled ahead of traditional power sources since the 2024 US elections. Renewables are expected to see 16% sales growth next year and 21% in 2027, while oil and gas will rise only 1% and 6%.

In a new autopsy of Biden’s energy agenda, former administration officials argue that bureaucracy, indecision, and fear of repeating past mistakes caused his agencies to slow-roll the administration’s clean energy ambitions. The document shared that as the administration worked to build clean energy projects, they underestimated how aggressively the incoming administration could turn its programs upside down.

Three years after the IRA, only a few federally funded projects broke ground, so most of the public never saw the benefits of these projects. For example, Biden’s $7.5 billion effort to install EV chargers in the US had created only 47 charging stations by December 2024.

4. $615,000 a Day: Order to Keep Coal Plant Open Ignites Debate in Michigan — The Wall Street Journal

In May, a Michigan coal-fired power plant was days from shutting down. Most workers had either retired or been reassigned. However, the Trump administration ordered the Campbell plant to stay open after declaring a grid-reliability emergency due to rising electricity demand.

Keeping the Campbell plant open has cost $80 million through September 30th, equivalent to $615,000 a day.

Keeping aging fossil-fuel plants open could cost U.S. consumers more than $3 billion each year, according to a report by consulting firm Grid Strategies on behalf of environmental groups.

The report warns that federal orders to keep plants running could incentivize other plants to claim they want to retire, in hopes of receiving similar mandates.

5. Michael Liebreich on a “pragmatic climate reset” – Volts

Some people, including Tony Blair, are pushing a “climate reset” that emphasizes costly, impractical technologies like direct air capture and small modular reactors over proven clean energy solutions.

Michael Liebreich criticizes the “electrify everything” slogan for fixating on hard-to-replace technologies instead of scaling today’s affordable and effective options. He and David Roberts argue that the wind and solar industries lack political clout because they’re fragmented, polite, and unwilling to engage in the aggressive lobbying tactics that fossil fuel interests have long mastered.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/maxresdefault-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 19:18:27.546164

Beale Infrastructure, in a letter attached to a memo County Administrator Jan Lesher released Thursday, says its “commitment to pursue 100% renewable energy for its Pima County data center is a significant additional investment and reflects the company’s dedication to sustainable infrastructure development.”

It will be achieved, Beale said in the letter, through the energy supply agreement it is seeking with Tucson Electric Power. Beale “will seek to accelerate the development of new renewable energy resources for TEP’s grid that produce enough energy to match 100% of the data center’s energy consumption — at the data center’s cost.”

But Lesher said a mutual agreement on the specific details of such commitments hasn’t been reached.

“Of primary issue is the lack of specificity on exactly how future new clean energy generation would be developed and paid for, the time frame for generation, the dollar amount of investment, and the best method for obtaining third-party validation of the proposed approach,” Lesher wrote to the Board of Supervisors.

Beale is also committing to invest $15 million in Pima County, it says in the letter, “to support local education, workforce development, and long-term community growth.”

“The community investment initiative will launch with a $5 million scholarship fund designed to support STEM education and trade school training in Pima County,” Beale says. “An additional $10 million will be allocated in future phases of the project for community benefit projects identified in collaboration with Pima County leadership. These investments will be tailored to local priorities and will provide long lasting benefits for county residents, such as digital equity investments and fiber infrastructure expansions.”

Lesher, in her memo to the Board of Supervisors, said these commitments were reached following a series of meetings between county administrators and Beale in recent months. She says the county suggested options and examples of “potential benefit projects” in September, and that Beale “indicated a preference for clean energy generation and work development options, which became the key focus of subsequent discussions.”

But she wrote that “while Beale states in their letter that details will be captured in a future agreement instrument, at this time there is no specificity on how the Beale commitments would be incorporated into an appropriate form of enforceable agreement to ensure future compliance.”

Beale said in the letter that it plans to finalize acquiring the property, which the Board of Supervisors approved selling to it in June, “and subsequently begin construction” by the end of the year. This is despite Pima County having “unresolved questions at this time,” Lesher said in her memo.

(DTN) -- The Trump administration granted two full small-refinery exemptions, 50% exemptions on 12 petitions and denied two other petitions for compliance years 2021 to 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a Renewable Fuel Standard announcement on Friday.

The announcement comes as the agency also considers public comments made on a proposal to reallocate biofuels gallons lost on 140 partial and full exemptions granted by the administration recently.

""With most of the old petitions now cleared, EPA is committed to working with DOE (U.S. Department of Energy) to address new petitions as quickly as possible and within the 90-day statutory review period, ... "" the EPA said in a news release.

""Furthermore, on Sept. 16, 2025, the agency announced a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking that takes into consideration the expected impacts of the Aug. 22, 2025, SRE decisions. EPA is reviewing comments on the supplemental proposed rule as the agency continues to work on final regulations for the 'Set 2' rule. As stated in the (supplemental proposal), EPA intends to update the agency's projections of exempted gasoline and diesel volumes in the final rule based on any additional SREs issued after the proposal, including the petition decisions in this action.""

EPA said announcement was part of the Trump EPA's ""commitment to get the RFS program back on track"" with an approach that recognizes ""some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others"" and that EPA's relief should reflect those differences.

""EPA is reaffirming the agency's policy of returning RFS compliance credits, known as renewable identification numbers, previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year,"" the agency said.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement he questions EPA's decision.

""Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,"" Cooper said.

""EPA added another 14 small-refinery exemptions to the already-massive pile today, based on the agency's questionable new approach to determining whether those refiners experienced 'disproportionate economic hardship.'""

Cooper said the RFA continues to dispute the notion that SREs are ""warranted at all"" since the agency's own analysis shows that all refiners -- large and small -- face a proportional RFS compliance obligation and pass their RIN costs through to buyers of their refined products.

""The silver lining here is that EPA is returning expired RINs to the six refineries who were granted exemptions from their 2021 and 2022 RFS obligations,"" Cooper said.

""However, more than 500 million valid RINs will be issued to eight refineries who were gifted exemptions from their 2023 and 2024 obligations, meaning there are now more than 2.5 billion RINs associated with 2023-2025 SREs that are likely to be dropped back onto the market in the months ahead.""

Cooper said if EPA decides not to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes, the ""impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating.""

He said EPA's decision further underscores the ""crucial need"" for EPA to finalize 2026-2027 renewable volume obligations that fully reallocate any and all SREs granted, or expected to be granted, for the 2023-2027 compliance years.

Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.","For all the headlines about an on-off relationship with Donald Trump, baiting liberals and erratic behaviour, Tesla shareholders are loath to part with Elon Musk.

Investors in the electric vehicle maker voted on Thursday to put the world’s richest person on the path to become the world’s first trillionaire, despite the controversy that is now seemingly intrinsic to his public profile.

Shareholders approved the $1tn compensation plan, which could yield the largest corporate payout in history if he meets a series of tough-looking goals, not least pushing Tesla from its current market value of $1.4tn to $8.5tn (£1.06tn to £6.4tn). Musk’s fortune, which includes a stake of about 12.5% in Tesla, is already worth $461bn.

“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” says Dan Ives, a managing director at the US financial firm Wedbush. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”

Ives is a self-described Tesla “core bull” who nonetheless has consistently raised concerns about the damage that the chief executive’s political stance has been doing to one of the world’s best-known brands.

Tesla sales suffered as Musk’s on-off relationship with Trump – funding his presidential campaign and his stint leading sweeping cuts at the “department of government efficiency” – damaged the appeal of its vehicles to a left-leaning consumer base.

There were signs of trouble before that as well, with market research firm Strategic Vision recording a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Musk bought Twitter (now X) in 2022, rolled back content moderation on the platform and reinstated banned accounts.

Other off-putting factors have been swirling around the Trump soap opera, such as reports of Musk’s alleged extensive drug consumption, his public support for far-right political parties and making fascist-style salutes at political rallies.

At one point in March, Ives warned that Tesla and Musk were embroiled in a “brand tornado crisis moment” as the backlash against the boss’s behaviour became a global problem amid falling sales. Other factors were at play in Tesla’s commercial wobbles, not least stiff competition from Chinese-made vehicles, but Musk’s notoriety has had an impact.

So why have investors stuck by Musk? Shares in Tesla have risen by nearly two-thirds since May, when the Tesla chief executive announced he was leaving the Trump administration (and then worrying investors by falling out with the president publicly). Third-quarter deliveries – a proxy for sales – trounced Wall Street estimates last month thanks to US consumers taking advantage of expiring federal tax credits for electric vehicles, although European sales suffered and analysts warned that Musk needs to cushion a post-credit slowdown by selling cheaper models.

Another factor is the culture among US investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged and Jeff Bezos had a long reign at the top of Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Indeed, most Tesla shareholders seemed concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company, instead of wanting him to leave altogether.

“Money talks in the US more,” says Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”

Other incentives in Musk’s $1tn pay package include delivering 20m Tesla vehicles, 10m self-driving car subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots and 1m robotaxis. These targets, particularly the robots and autonomous vehicles, require the kind of entrepreneurial and technological chutzpah that Musk has shown at Tesla and his rocket company SpaceX.

Matthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst, says the added value Musk has brought to Tesla’s stock is “undeniable” and has made “many people rich, including himself”.

However, Schmidt adds that Tesla’s core car business has reached its peak and describes the autonomous vehicle plans as “certainly not the best in the market”.

“Have shareholders been naively blind-sided by past achievements rather than the foresight of future prospects? Perhaps!” he says.

Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cb8833e4592b9303ab0d6e5865b64e9e0c5596c/277_0_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d5963c151088c8697206d2ca493a6f2",N,,2025-11-07 13:18:55.732080

The Southern Environmental Law Center plans to bring an upcoming Duke Energy program before the North Carolina Court of Appeals. The program, called Clean Energy Impact, is supposed to allow companies and individuals to buy energy credits to support North Carolina’s clean energy transition.

A version of the program is currently available in Florida, where Duke advertises that customers can “offset [their] energy use with clean solar energy” generated in the state. State regulators approved the program’s expansion into North Carolina earlier this year, where it would launch sometime in 2026, replacing Go Renewable.

The SELC filed a Notice of Appeal on behalf of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy last Thursday. The appeal claims that the commission does not require the credits to come from projects beyond what the company is already required to build by law.

“If you’re subscribing to a program, and nothing in Duke’s behavior is changing, there’s no additional solar being procured, you’re not offsetting anything,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at SELC.

But what does that mean? And what even are these energy credits?

What is Duke Energy selling?

Duke Energy is selling a renewable energy credit plus the value of the carbon emissions it avoided when it produced the credit. A renewable energy credit, or REC, is equal to one megawatt hour of renewable energy. If you’re a business, you might buy some of these to meet your company's sustainability goals. They’re not offsets, but a company might buy them and say something like, “We’re powered by 100% green energy.”

But what counts as renewable energy? In North Carolina, the term “renewable energy” casts a wide net. It includes:

Solar and wind energy

Burning the methane gas trapped from hog or human waste

Burning wood pellets

It also includes some surprising additions, such as burning rubber tires (see pg. 24). When we’re talking about Clean Energy Impact, Duke plans to start with RECs that come from solar projects, then broaden the program to include some of the methods mentioned above

In 2023, state legislators expanded RECs to include nuclear energy. The state’s new “Clean Energy Portfolio Standard” included renewables as well, although that category still includes generation techniques that release carbon dioxide and other air pollutants as byproducts, such as biogas and, well, tires.

In other states, such as California, RECs included “avoided carbon emissions.” This refers to the carbon emissions the utility didn’t release when it chose renewable energy over burning fossil fuels. This is measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide.

When North Carolina legislators created RECs in 2007, they excluded “avoided carbon” from the definition, writing that “a 'renewable energy certificate' does not include the related emission reductions, including, but not limited to, reductions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, mercury, or carbon dioxide.”

What Duke sells is a little different than what North Carolina calls a “REC.” Clean Energy Environmental Attributes, or CEEAs, are Duke’s energy credits that include one megawatt-hour of renewable energy, plus additional characteristics such as the emissions the utility avoided when it generated that unit of energy. In that way, they’re more similar to the RECs that other states offer, though Duke’s new credits aren’t going to be certified by Green-e® Energy, a third-party organization that verifies that a credit hasn’t already been used for something else, like regulatory compliance.

The RECs that Duke sells under its existing program, Go Renewable, are certified, but they don’t come with the guarantee that the utility generated them in-state.

Duke plans to sell these CEEAs in 250-kilowatt-hour “blocks,” so folks can purchase fractions of a total credit.

Making an appeal based on simple addition

So, why is SACE appealing state regulators’ decision to approve Clean Energy Impact? At the crux of their argument is an idea called “regulatory surplus.”

When state legislators set North Carolina’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal, they also directed state regulators to develop a voluntary program with Duke Energy that allows residential, commercial and industrial customers to buy RECS “to offset their energy consumption.”

“The word offset has to mean something,” Jimenez said.

Every couple of years, Duke Energy proposes a new resource plan, which the Utilities Commission considers and votes on. The plan states Duke Energy will build or procure a certain amount of clean energy. For example, the 2023 resource plan ordered the utility to add 3,460 megawatts of new solar to the grid by 2031. The question that SACE is asking is: If I buy a REC, does that money go toward those megawatts? Or does it go toward the procurement of clean energy in addition to those 3,460 MW?

Imagine a pie. This pie is the cost of building 3,460 megawatts of solar energy. Normally, ratepayers within a given customer class (residential, commercial or industrial) would eat an identical slice of that payment pie. But with Clean Energy Impact, you could choose to eat more of that pie. Either way, the pie’s gonna get eaten, but you could say you ate more of that pie and even get a certificate that says you did.

It’s a problem of “additionality” — does the program create additional renewable energy resources, or would Duke Energy have built or procured these resources anyway? Duke responded to a WFAE inquiry that “the program was not designed to offer additionality.” State regulators noted that “CEEAs from the [Clean Energy Impact] Program will be applied by Duke towards Duke’s compliance with the Carbon Plan and will not constitute procurements over-and-above Duke’s compliance obligations under the Carbon Plan.” Duke’s resource plan is also called its “Carbon Plan.”

The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy wrote in an earlier filing that “the CEI Program has the potential to mislead customers into believing that the CEEAs they purchase are surplus to regulation.”

“Duke’s new customer program undermines the trust of North Carolinians seeking to protect their families and future generations from the consequences of climate-warming carbon pollution,” said Stacey Washington, clean energy and equity director with SACE, in a written statement.

SACE isn’t alone. The North Carolina Public Staff, the state agency that represents ratepayers, said “participants could mistakenly believe that their participation in the Program would support additional development of renewable energy in the State.”

Then-commissioner Jeffrey A. Hughes wrote in his dissenting opinion that the CEEAs have “not been shown to provide a meaningful public or private benefit to customers.”

“It appears to be nothing more than an accounting exercise that will require implementation resources and funds that could be better spent in other ways to have a more impactful reduction on carbon emissions,” Hughes wrote.

But it didn’t have to be this way, as Hughes goes on to point out. Duke and the commission could have designed credits that accelerated the buildout of renewable resources, even if those resources would have been built eventually anyway. Alternatively, the program could have funded new behind-the-meter resources, like rooftop solar. In either example, buying the credits would have reduced carbon emissions.

During its resource planning, Duke Energy chooses resources based on the “least cost” pathway to reliable energy and regulatory compliance. When asked if the utility included the sale of RECs or CEEAs when forecasting the cost of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind, the company responded that it did not.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fbf0352/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4800x2520+0+340/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F93%2F3411f8fe463bbf0969ef175ee114%2Fduke-energy-solar-panels01.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:07:11.746146

Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the Wall Street Journal wrote that Ford executives “are in active discussions” about the truck’s future.
Ford has previously had to pause F-150 Lightning production to keep inventory levels in check.
Even if the F-150 Lightning gets dropped, which hasn’t been decided yet, Ford won’t give up on EVs.
The brand hasn’t announced what’s next for the F-150 Lightning, however, and a spokesperson that Hagerty reached out to refused to confirm or deny the report.","The electric Ford F-150 Lightning isn’t long for this world, according to a new report. Demand for electric trucks is falling across the nation: Ram notably canceled the battery-powered version of the 1500 earlier in 2025, and the lack of interest is making it tough for Ford to justify spending money on the Lightning.

Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the Wall Street Journal wrote that Ford executives “are in active discussions” about the truck’s future. Lightning production has been on hiatus since October 2025 due to a shortage of aluminum, which is widely used in every current-generation F-150, and Ford is debating whether it’s worth resuming production once the situation improves. The brand sold 1500 units of the Lightning in October 2025, compared to about 66,000 examples of the gasoline-powered F-Series pickup.

On paper, the case against the Lightning is pretty strong. EV sales have dropped recently, which explains why the list of companies that have softened or rolled back their electric-only plans is fairly long. The truck segment has been hit particularly hard as relatively high prices, limited driving range, and below-average towing and hauling capabilities keep buyers on the gasoline- or hybrid-powered side of the segment. Ford has previously had to pause F-150 Lightning production to keep inventory levels in check.

Even if the F-150 Lightning gets dropped, which hasn’t been decided yet, Ford won’t give up on EVs. It’s still planning to build an electric compact pickup with a base price of about $30,000, according to the same report. This strategy falls in line with Ford CEO Jim Farley’s recent comments that American drivers want smaller, more affordable EVs that they can use to commute in rather than big, expensive models.

Ford has logged $13 billion in EV losses since 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal, so the writing may have been on the wall years ago. The brand hasn’t announced what’s next for the F-150 Lightning, however, and a spokesperson that Hagerty reached out to refused to confirm or deny the report.

“We have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center (REVC) back up at the right time, but don’t have an exact date at this time,” a spokesperson told Hagerty.

It’s not just Ford whose electric pickups haven’t struck a chord with buyers. General Motors sells the Chevrolet Silverado EV, the GMC Sierra EV, and the GMC Hummer EV, and none have lived up to the lofty volume expectations set for them years ago. Sales of the three trucks combined totaled about 1800 units in October 2025, the Wall Street Journal wrote, which represents a droplet in the proverbial pickup bucket. Executives are now asking themselves the same question as their counterparts at Ford: What’s the point?

MONTREAL, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: HPQ, OTCQB: HPQFF, FRA: O08), a technology company driving innovation in advanced materials and critical process development, welcomes the Government of Canada’s 2025 Federal Budget, which introduces $141 billion in new spending to strengthen domestic industrial capacity, expand clean-energy infrastructure, and accelerate the commercialization of next-generation technologies.

HPQ CEO Bernard Tourillon said the budget’s focus on productivity, clean manufacturing, and Canadian supply resilience sends a clear signal: Canada wants to build things again, and it’s ready to back innovators turning R&D into industrial reality.

Bernard Tourillon, President and CEO of HPQ Silicon Inc, said:

This budget is good for companies like HPQ because it recognizes that real growth happens when ideas become assets,

“Our three core technology pillars: Fumed Silica, HPQ ENDURA+ Batteries, and METAGENE™ Hydrogen, are exactly the kind of made-in-Canada, clean-industrial projects the government wants to see scale. The measures announced this week make it easier, faster, and more competitive to build that capacity here at home.”

FUMED SILICA: Reshoring High-Value Materials to North America

HPQ’s proprietary Fumed Silica Reactor technology transforms quartz in one step into fumed silica, without the need for toxic feedstocks. The budget’s Productivity Super-Deduction and emphasis on clean-power infrastructure directly support HPQ’s plan to establish the only domestic production in Canada, replacing imports from the United States, China and Europe [see October 23, 2025, release for latest development on this technology].

Tourillon explained,

The government is lowering the cost of capital for companies investing in clean manufacturing,

“That means every dollar we spend building fumed-silica reactors or downstream finishing equipment goes further—while Canada’s push for low-carbon power ensures our process remains one of the cleanest in the world.”

HPQ ENDURA+ Batteries: Building Domestic Energy Storage

The budget’s Defence Industrial Strategy and Buy Canadian procurement rule create strong demand channels for home-grown energy storage. HPQ’s ENDURA+ GEN3 silicon-anode lithium-ion cells, now in industrial testing in both 18650 and 21700 formats, align perfectly with this policy [see October 30, 2025, release for latest development on this technology].

Tourillon noted,

We see a clear intersection between the government’s procurement priorities and our technology,

“HPQ ENDURA+ delivers higher energy density, longer cycle life, and the advantage of being manufactured in Canada. From defence and telecommunications to mobility and grid storage, there’s now a policy framework encouraging those sectors to source domestically.”

METAGENE™ Hydrogen: Powering Canada’s Clean-Fuel Future

Under the budget’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy, hydrogen is identified as a critical pillar of the clean-economy transition. HPQ, through its exclusive North American license from Novacium SAS for the METAGENE™ technology, is ideally positioned to manufacture and deploy this proprietary hydrogen production process in Canada. The on-demand, autonomous, and low-carbon nature of METAGENE™ not only aligns with Ottawa’s clean-fuel and industrial-decarbonization goals but is also exceptionally well suited to Canada’s vast geography and distributed energy needs [see June 10, 2025, release for latest development on this technology].

Tourillon, said:

Hydrogen isn’t just an energy source; it’s a strategic asset,

“METAGENE™ gives Canada a path to produce safely and on demand clean hydrogen locally, without depending on the massive infrastructure required for traditional Hydrogen production processes. The incentives outlined in this budget make domestic deployment and scale-up significantly more achievable.”

Positioned for Canada’s Next Industrial Phase

The 2025 Federal Budget marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s shift from policy ambition to industrial execution. Its new investment tools (accelerated write-offs, refundable tax credits, and national procurement preferences) are designed to anchor clean-technology manufacturing on Canadian soil.

For HPQ, these measures reinforce a strategy already in motion:

advancing Fumed Silica production that reduces reliance on imports,

scaling HPQ ENDURA+ cell manufacturing that supports energy storage and mobility, and

deploying METAGENE™ Hydrogen systems that enable low-carbon fuel generation.

Tourillon concluded,

HPQ has been building toward this kind of industrial landscape for years,

“This budget confirms that Canada is serious about translating innovation into domestic capacity—and HPQ is ideally positioned to turn that vision into results.”

Duke Energy on Friday reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81 for the third quarter, up by 11% from the same period a year earlier.

The earnings also beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.75 per share.

The higher earnings for the third quarter “were driven by the implementation of new rates and riders, along with higher retail sales volumes,” said Duke Energy, whose electric utilities serve 8.6 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, and collectively own 55,100 megawatts (MW) of energy capacity.

“As load growth materializes across our jurisdictions, we are expecting our new five-year capital plan to be between $95 and $105 billion when we refresh the plan in February, increasing the largest capital plan in the industry,” Duke Energy president and CEO Harry Sideris said in a statement.

In August, Duke Energy agreed to sell an indirect 19.7% stake in its Florida business to infrastructure investor Brookfield for $6 billion in cash, part of which will fund Duke’s increased capital spending plan for the next five years.

A total of $2 billion of the proceeds from the transaction will fund Duke Energy’s increased $87 billion, current five-year capital plan, while the remaining $4 billion will be used to displace holding company debt, the firm said.

In recent months, U.S. power utilities have announced billions of U.S. dollars in capital plans until the end of the decade and are getting a lot of requests from Big Tech for new power capacity in certain areas as the surge in AI and the expansion of data centers drive demand.

Electric utilities in the United States are set to spend $212.1 billion in capex this year alone, which would be a 22.3% annual increase, as they race to secure new electricity supply for data centers, the Financial Times has reported, citing data from Jefferies.

AASHTO also urged Congress to avoid relying on both short-term and full-year continuing resolutions or CRs as it did for FY 2025, as CRs can cause unnecessary program disruptions, uncertainty, and delays in safety and mobility benefits to states and communities. In particular, short-term extensions can make it difficult for state DOTs and local governments to plan and execute contracts for important highway and transit projects, AASHTO said.

Aubeny said the offshore wind industry is expected to grow significantly, with an estimated 270,000 megawatts of floating wind capacity by 2050.
This expansion will demand a large number of anchors — about 40,000 for the projected 13,500 floating wind turbines, roughly three anchors per turbine.
Aubeny and his team developed a reliable and affordable anchoring solution that optimizes offshore wind farms, boosts geotechnical efficiency and promotes the broader adoption of sustainable energy.
The system’s versatility makes it suited for other offshore enterprises beyond wind energy.","As the race to harness offshore wind power accelerates, a Texas A&M University civil engineering professor is anchoring innovation, literally.

Dr. Charles Aubeny, a professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, has developed an anchoring system to securely and affordably moor thousands of floating wind turbines in deep ocean waters. The innovative Deeply Embedded Ring Anchor (DERA) system provides a more efficient solution than traditional anchors created for the oil and gas industry, which are not ideal for extensive renewable energy initiatives.

Aubeny began exploring the concept around 2017. His lab’s research, including a collaboration with partners at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Maine and the University of California, Davis, demonstrated that a key to higher efficiency is deep embedment. Subsequent development of the concept led to a commercialization effort with Dr. Junho Lee, a recently graduated doctoral student.

Aubeny said the offshore wind industry is expected to grow significantly, with an estimated 270,000 megawatts of floating wind capacity by 2050. This expansion will demand a large number of anchors — about 40,000 for the projected 13,500 floating wind turbines, roughly three anchors per turbine. In comparison, a typical oil and gas project usually needs 12 to 20 anchors. This scale of renewable energy demands a new approach.

“The existing anchors, which were largely developed for oil and gas applications, were not particularly economical, and they didn’t really need to be,” he said. “Anchors for a multi-billion-dollar oil production system are less than 1% of the cost. Oil companies have little motivation to try to sharpen the pencil and cut costs on efficiency. But for floating renewables, the mooring and anchoring system is about 15 to 20% of the project cost.”

Anchor strength increases the deeper it is embedded in the soil. Achieving deep embedment in a marine environment turns out to be a challenging task, but recent research has demonstrated that it is feasible using a novel follower system to drive the anchor deep below the seabed surface with existing marine equipment. This deep placement allows the anchor to be significantly smaller and more compact than traditional anchor designs, resulting in substantial cost savings and reduced logistical efforts.

One major benefit of the DERA system is its adaptability across different seabed conditions. The anchor can be installed in soft clay using suction techniques or in sand and layered soils using vibratory methods. This flexibility is especially valuable in regions like Taiwan and South Korea, where sandy soils are prone to geohazard risks such as earthquake-induced liquefaction and erosion from strong currents. Because DERA is embedded deep below the seabed, it remains unaffected by surface-level geohazards, ensuring a high load capacity and exceptional reliability.

DERA’s compact size addresses logistical issues and bypasses infrastructure problems by reducing the need for support vessels and allowing construction at existing plants.

“The idea is to have a small, efficient anchor that solves a host of problems,” Aubeny explained. “It allows you to use existing fabrication plants, reduces demand on port facilities and minimizes the need for specialized marine vessels.”

The DERA addresses the need for renewable energy innovation. Aubeny and his team developed a reliable and affordable anchoring solution that optimizes offshore wind farms, boosts geotechnical efficiency and promotes the broader adoption of sustainable energy. The system’s versatility makes it suited for other offshore enterprises beyond wind energy.",https://stories.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/News-CVEN-WindTurbines-20Oct2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 13:01:34.800899

Workers must navigate high-voltage systems, automated processes and digital quality controls that bear little resemblance to the combustion engine factories of previous generations. Georgia has just opened a facility designed to bridge that gap.

The Hyundai Mobility Training Centre, unveiled on 5th November in Ellabell, represents the state's first purpose-built EV training facility. Positioned adjacent to Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Bryan County, the 89,000 sq ft centre can accommodate 824 trainees simultaneously, preparing them for roles at the Metaplant and its network of affiliate companies.

""With record-breaking economic development statewide, our focus has never wavered from bringing quality jobs to hardworking Georgians and connecting them to the skills needed for success,"" said Governor Brian Kemp. ""The Hyundai Mobility Training Centre of Georgia will give thousands of people over the years the knowledge they need to benefit from this generational project.""

The timing proves significant. Hyundai recently announced expansion plans to incorporate hybrid vehicle production at the Metaplant, requiring the training infrastructure to adapt beyond its original electric-only mandate. The facility's flexible design anticipates this evolution, though the immediate focus remains on battery-electric manufacturing processes.

Georgia's EV workforce infrastructure reaches completion

Georgia Quick Start, the state's workforce development programme operating under the Technical College System of Georgia, manages the facility. The programme holds the distinction of being America's oldest workforce training initiative and claims multiple awards from site selection consultants, though such accolades matter less than the practical challenge ahead.

""The Hyundai Mobility Training Centre of Georgia represents our commitment to investing in people as we continue to create high-paying American jobs,"" said José Muñoz, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company. ""As we expand production at HMGMA, one of the most advanced facilities in the world, we need a workforce equipped with the skills to build next-generation vehicles with next-generation production processes.

""Our partnership with Georgia Quick Start ensures our Meta Pros have access to world-class training that will help them succeed and help Georgia lead in advanced manufacturing. A special thank you to Governor Kemp, Commissioner Wilson, and the economic development team in Georgia for their ongoing support. It's a great time to be with Hyundai in Georgia.""

Hyundai ups US bet to $26bn

Despite an immigration raid at its Georgia plant, Hyundai Motor Group boosts US investment to $26bn, including a $2.7bn EV expansion, to counter tariffs and leverage EV incentives, spotlighting labour reliance issues.

The facility emerges from direct collaboration between Quick Start's training professionals and Hyundai's engineering teams, ensuring the simulated environment reflects actual production conditions rather than theoretical approximations.

Training capacity designed to support 8,500 manufacturing jobs

Hyundai projects its Georgia operation will generate approximately 8,500 jobs by 2031. The training centre must therefore function as a continuous pipeline rather than a one-time preparation exercise for automotive production. Workers will cycle through multiple training modules, each designed to build specific competencies required for different stages of EV assembly.

""This centre is about giving Georgians the tools to build their own futures, right here at home,"" said Greg Dozier, Commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia. ""It reflects Georgia's commitment to innovation, accessibility, and long-term economic opportunity.""

The infrastructure includes a High Voltage Battery and Safety Lab, addressing what may be the most critical safety differential between traditional and EV manufacturing. Workers handling battery systems must understand electrical risks that rarely existed on conventional assembly lines. A VR Experience Lab provides simulated safety scenarios and hazard identification training without exposing trainees to actual danger.

Simulated production lines mirror Metaplant operations

The facility's centrepiece consists of two distinct production training systems. The STEP Line (Safe Transition for Efficient Production), functions as an introductory environment where workers develop timing, coordination and spatial awareness in a controlled digital setting. Trainees progress to the IMPACT Line (Immersive Manufacturing Process and Conveyor Training), which replicates full-scale production conditions. This moving line incorporates 53 integrated assembly activities and an embedded quality verification system, mirroring the actual Metaplant workflow.

GM and Hyundai form a wide-ranging new partnership, and Toyota reinvents its Kentucky plant to pioneer global manufacturing standards

""Our subject matter experts partnered directly with HMGMA to learn the skills its Meta Pros will need when they hit the production floor,"" said Scott McMurray, Quick Start Deputy Commissioner. ""Our team has simulated those processes in a safe, hands-on training environment.""

Beyond assembly training, the centre houses an Automation and Mechatronics Lab focused on programmable logic controllers, sensors, motion systems and industrial automation protocols. These technologies increasingly define modern automotive manufacturing, where human workers collaborate with robotic systems rather than operate independently.

Supporting facilities include a 5,764 sq ft multipurpose space designated the Momentum Room, six flexible classrooms, and specialised labs for robotics, welding and paint processes. The centre even deploys a robotic dog for advanced automation training, though the practical applications of this particular technology remain to be demonstrated in actual production environments.

Hybrid vehicle expansion demands flexible training approach

The recent announcement of hybrid vehicle production at the Metaplant adds complexity to the training mandate. Hybrid powertrains combine combustion engines with electric drive systems, requiring workers to understand both traditional mechanical assembly and high-voltage electrical integration. The training centre's flexible design theoretically accommodates this dual requirement, though the specific curriculum adaptations have yet to be detailed.

""Today's grand opening of the Hyundai Mobility Training Centre of Georgia marks a proud milestone for Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, the State of Georgia, the Technical College System, and Georgia Quick Start,"" said Tony Heo, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America. ""This training centre gives us confidence that we'll have the trained talent needed to shape the future of mobility and American manufacturing, right here in Southeast Georgia.""

Ultimately, it will be quality metrics, efficiency rates and safety records which reveal whether simulated training environments adequately prepare workers for the pressures and complexities of actual EV manufacturing.

“For example, this year, in North Carolina, we have built a battery plant, which was a major decision, and this led to increasing the local procurement rate in North America,” Azuma said. “Our plan to produce locally as much as possible remains unchanged, so we would like to move or make efforts toward that going forward.”

Azuma’s comments came during a question-and-answer session with the Tokyo press corps after he and CFO Kenda Kon detailed the company’s results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year.

Through Sept. 30, the company reported $11.6 billion in net income, a 7% decrease from the same time the year before. The company expects full-year operating income of $22.2 billion, or 29% less than in fiscal 2024-25.

The Trump administration’s tariffs aimed at promoting U.S. manufacturing are a major factor, prompting a $9.5 billion hit for the Japanese company’s full year results, Toyota estimates.

The factory in Liberty has about 2,000 workers assembling battery components for the Corolla Cross hybrid electric vehicle and, starting in September, for Camrys made in Kentucky, Toyota said in July.

Many data centers are affiliated with well-resourced companies that pride themselves on innovation.
Texas, for example, recently enacted legislation allowing data centers to connect to the grid but be subject to curtailment.
While some other state public utilities commissions and utilities are contemplating similar arrangements for data centers, most are still operating under old models and assumptions.","Alexandra Klass is the James G. Degnan Professor of Law at Michigan Law, and Dave Owen is the Albert Abramson ’54 Distinguished Professor of Law at UC Law San Francisco.

The United States faces massive growth in electricity demand. If utilities’ projections are right, data centers will drive much of that growth. And if utilities try to meet that demand in traditional ways, the results could be bad for consumers, the environment and the tech industry.

Those traditional ways assume that utilities must meet the needs of electricity customers at all times. This requires utilities to build new power plants and transmission and distribution lines and (in most states) pass those costs, plus a profit margin, on to consumers. Utilities also will not allow major new users to connect to the grid until those users’ needs can be met.

These principles are a poor fit for the present moment. Building new power plants and transmission lines has become increasingly difficult. If data centers must wait until that infrastructure is fully built, they may wait for years. Worse, utilities and government officials are citing the potential data-center boom as a reason to extend the life of old, expensive, and heavily polluting coal plants or to build new gas plants. If they do so, and if they pass those costs on to consumers, retail electricity prices and pollution will rise.

And if current demand projections turn out to be overestimates — which has happened during past tech booms — consumers will pay for new power plants that never needed to be built.

But this unfortunate scenario is not inevitable. We are scholars of energy, natural resources, and environmental law, and in a paper we explore a better way of meeting this moment. Our inspiration comes from legal systems for allocating water, particularly in the American West, and natural gas. For both resources, intermittent scarcity has often been assumed, and legal systems evolved to manage shortages. These systems provide instructive models for electricity.

Allocation systems for water and natural gas have a few key elements. First, they generally allow new users to connect to the system even if supplies won’t always meet those users’ demand. Second, resource managers can curtail users’ access in times of shortage. And third, importantly, these systems allow and encourage users to find innovative ways to insure against uncertainty.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

For example, a water user who holds a “junior” — and therefore relatively insecure — water right but wants highly secure deliveries could contract with a more “senior” right-holder for additional water in times of scarcity at a mutually agreeable price. Or the junior right-holder might construct additional storage facilities or water-recycling facilities to help it through times of need. A combination of trading and innovation thus creates security for users and makes more efficient use of the resource, while alleviating the need to find expensive new supplies.

The same concepts hold promise for electricity. Instead of waiting five years for electric utilities to build expensive new gas plants, state regulators and utilities could allow a data center to connect to the grid but be subject to curtailment. Knowing that risk, the data center could contract with demand-response providers, who specialize in freeing up electricity through short-term shifts in the timing or level of use, to provide backup supplies. Or the data center might build its own solar-and-storage resources. Many data centers are affiliated with well-resourced companies that pride themselves on innovation. They can find creative solutions if legal systems encourage them to do so.

Already, this model is emerging. Texas, for example, recently enacted legislation allowing data centers to connect to the grid but be subject to curtailment. But Texas remains an outlier. While some other state public utilities commissions and utilities are contemplating similar arrangements for data centers, most are still operating under old models and assumptions. We urge other state commissions and legislatures to use their authority to begin to fashion similar creative solutions. State action in this area can make progress even while regulators and stakeholders debate whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission organizations also have Federal Power Act jurisdiction to act, as the U.S. Department of Energy recently proposed.

Is history repeating itself? The last time a technology boom drove a surge in gas generation, it didn’t turn out so well, but that’s not stopping investors from pouring billions into new and expanded thermal generation.

Here are the numbers that jumped out from some of the biggest stories of the week.

By the Numbers

$1.93 million/MW

The price gas power merger and acquisitions have reached in some markets, according to energy analytics firm Enverus. The artificial intelligence boom, along with expectations of increased manufacturing and electrification, is driving a surge in natural gas investment, but thermal generation remains risky, some analysts say, drawing parallels to the dot com bubble at the turn of the century.

26 GW

About how much generating capacity the U.S. added between January and August of this year, led by solar and wind, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s monthly infrastructure report. That figure does not include storage. In February, the Energy Information Administration said it expected the U.S. grid to add 63 GW of new utility-scale electric-generating capacity, including storage, up from 48.6 GW in 2024. China installed between 430 GW and 470 GW in 2024, 356 GW of which was from non-hydro renewables.

48.7%

The Institute for Supply Management’s latest Purchasing Managers’ Index for the month of October, a key metric for measuring the health of the manufacturing sector. A PMI index below 50% indicates an industry in contraction. Manufacturing, along with artificial intelligence and electrification, is one of the main drivers behind projections of surging load growth in some parts of the country. October marked the 8th consecutive month of contraction for the sector.

$84/MWh

How much Dominion now expects the levelized cost of electricity generated by its 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project to be after the One Bill Beautiful Bill Act cut renewable energy tax credits. That estimate is within the $80/MWh to $90/MWh range Dominion envisioned in its 2021 initial filing and would support a net monthly customer bill savings of 63 cents, the utility says. The project is still scheduled to come online in late 2026 or early 2027, executives say.

949

Miles of new 765-kV lines included in an $8.6 billion transmission plan approved by the Southwest Power Pool board of directors this week. SPP says its planned 765-kV regional transmission “backbone” will be able to carry four times the power its existing 345 kV lines do, and do so more efficiently. 765 kV transmission lines are the highest operating voltages in the U.S. but are new in both SPP and in the neighboring Electric Reliability Council of Texas market.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gfYa5mAqSbzOt2vlW1hDsaPXUYEd2zeIjzeWhAMTJQE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CYXN0cm9wX0VuZXJneV9DZW50ZXJfLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-07 15:00:39.809551

Speaking at Redhills in Durham this week on the 40th anniversary of the Miners’ Strike, which ripped the heart out of many communities and sent the region’s once vast coalfield community into terminal decline, he said: “A previous generation was let down by the last transition, when the Government failed to support communities in deindustrialisation.

“The changes happened without their consent - it didn’t happen with them, it happened to them - and I see the scars of that today.

“That’s why, at this moment in time, the green industrial revolution is so important in terms of the positive impacts it can make to our local communities, and it is so important we explain that to people.

""We expect 20,000 green jobs to come to the North East by 2030 as we train up a whole new generation of workers in good, well-paid jobs.

""In Hartlepool, that's going to mean well-paid, secure jobs in the offshore wind sector, in carbon capture and in nuclear.

""There'll be plenty of other jobs in the area as well that will come from the supply chain involved in constructing these projects and running them when they're operational.

“It’s going to have a great impact and instead of being in very clustered places - which tends to be the case with the coal, oil and gas industries - these new clean energy jobs will be spread much more evenly around the North East.

“We want to avoid the mistakes of the past, where we saw deindustrialisation happening without a clear plan of what comes next.

“I’m interested in reindustrialisation of the North East, not deindustrialisation - I don’t want a single factory to be closing because of the clean energy transition.”

McDonald, who has strong family connections to the coal industry, was delivering a keynote speech at Redhills, home of the Durham Miners Association, at a clean energy conference being held by the Durham Energy Institute.

Redhills itself is a metaphor for the green transition, having fallen into disuse before being restored and reopened, powered almost entirely by renewable energy.

McDonald, who has been promoted to the Government’s Under Secretary of State, (Department for Energy Security and Net Zero), recently oversaw the release of the first-ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy, with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030.

The plan highlighted 31 priority occupations, such as plumbers, electricians and welders who will be particularly in demand and announced five new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train the next generation of workers.

McDonald said: “The green energy sector is growing three times faster than the rest of the economy, so if you’re looking for growth, that’s where growth is.

“Wind and solar are the cheapest forms of energy that we have.

“We know it is a big change and a big challenge in transitioning but it’s also a real opportunity.

“Britain is a nation with a coastline that makes it perfect for renewable energy and we plan to double investment in green energy and become a world leader so that investors have long-term confidence in the UK.

“We have the biggest market in the world for the offshore industry but we want it not just to supply British businesses and homes, but to provide jobs here.

“We want the supply chain to be captured as much as possible so that the jobs are here - good, long-term, well-paid jobs and I want to see the North East really benefit from that.""

McDonald’s keynote speech was made at a conference bringing groups from across society together at the former ‘Pitman’s Parliament' to discuss the latest developments in renewable energy, including mine water heating, hydrogen technology, offshore wind, clean shipping and sustainable energy solutions for the NHS.

The event also focused on community involvement, with workshops led by pupils from Prince Bishops Primary School in Bishop Auckland, creative writing sessions on the climate crisis, and community energy consultations.

McDonald said meetings like the one at Redhills had a very important role to play in making sure that the public could see the clear benefits of clean energy and get on board with the drive to decarbonise.

He said: “I’m disappointed that there’s a political fracture just now because we used to have a consensus around the energy transition in the UK.

“Some political parties are keen to move away from that climate consensus and, in my view, that's not because they care about communities in the North East.

“It's because fundamentally they are responding to big corporations who are concerned that maybe their global trading ambitions won’t be realised in the same way.

But even as building owners face mounting pressure to comply with stricter energy codes, making smart decisions about how to invest in efficiency is a major challenge.

Lamarr.AI, born in part from MIT research, is making the process of finding ways to improve the energy efficiency of buildings as easy as clicking a button. When customers order a building review, it triggers a coordinated symphony of drones, thermal and visible-range cameras, and artificial intelligence designed to identify problems and quantify the impact of potential upgrades. Lamarr.AI's technology also assesses structural conditions, creates detailed 3D models of buildings, and recommends retrofits. The solution is already being used by leading organizations across facilities management as well as by architecture, engineering, and construction firms.

""We identify the root cause of the anomalies we find,"" says CEO and co-founder Tarek Rakha PhD '15. ""Our platform doesn't just say, 'This is a hot spot and this is a cold spot.' It specifies 'This is infiltration or exfiltration. This is missing insulation. This is water intrusion.' The detected anomalies are also mapped to a 3D model of the building, and there are deeper analytics, such as the cost of each retrofit and the return on investment.""

To date, the company estimates its platform has helped clients across health care, higher education, and multifamily housing avoid over $3 million in unnecessary construction and retrofit costs by recommending targeted interventions over costly full-system replacements, while improving energy performance and extending asset life. For building owners managing portfolios worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Lamarr.AI's approach represents a fundamental shift from reactive maintenance to strategic asset management.

The founders, who also include MIT Professor John Fernández and Research Scientist Norhan Bayomi SM '17, PhD '21, are thrilled to see their technology accelerating the transition to more energy-efficient and higher-performing buildings.

""Reducing carbon emissions in buildings gets you the greatest return on investment in terms of climate interventions, but what has been needed are the technologies and tools to help the real estate and construction sectors make the right decisions in a timely and economical way,"" Fernández says.

Automating building scans

Bayomi and Rakha completed their PhDs in the MIT Department of Architecture's Building Technology Program. For her thesis, Bayomi developed technology to detect features of building exteriors and classify thermal anomalies through scans of buildings, with a specific focus on the impact of heat waves on low-income communities. Bayomi and her collaborators eventually deployed the system to detect air leaks as part of a partnership with a community in New York City.

After graduating MIT, Rakha became an assistant professor at Syracuse University. In 2015, together with fellow Syracuse University Professor Senem Velipasalar, he began developing his concept for drone-based building analytics - an idea that later received support through a grant from New York State's Department of Economic Development. In 2019, Bayomi and Fernández joined the project, and the team received a $1.8 million research award from the U.S. Department of Energy.

""The technology is like giving a building an MRI using drones, infrared imaging, visible light imaging, and proprietary AI that we developed through computer vision technology, along with large language models for report generation,"" Rakha explains.

""When we started the research, we saw firsthand how vulnerable communities were suffering from inefficient buildings, but couldn't afford comprehensive diagnostics,"" Bayomi says. ""We knew that if we could automate this process and reduce costs while improving accuracy, we'd unlock a massive market. Now we're seeing demand from everyone, from municipal buildings to major institutional portfolios.""

Lamarr.AI was officially founded in 2021 to commercialize the technology, and the founders wasted no time tapping into MIT's entrepreneurial ecosystem. First, they received a small seed grant from the MIT Sandbox Innovation Fund. In 2022, they won the MITdesignX prize and were semifinalists in the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. The founders named the company after Hedy Lamarr, the famous actress and inventor of a patented technology that became the basis for many modern secure communications.

Current methods for detecting air leaks in buildings utilize fan pressurizers or smoke. Contractors or building engineers may also spot-check buildings with handheld infrared cameras to manually identify temperature differences across individual walls, windows, and ductwork.

Lamarr.AI's system can perform building inspections far more quickly. Building managers can order the company's scans online and select when they'd like the drone to fly. Lamarr.AI partners with drone companies worldwide to fly off-the-shelf drones around buildings, providing them with flight plans and specifications for success. Images are then uploaded onto Lamarr.AI's platform for automated analysis.

""As an example, a survey of a 180,000-square-foot building like the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, which we scanned, produces around 2,000 images,"" Fernández says. ""For someone to go through those manually would take a couple of weeks. Our models autonomously analyze those images in a few seconds.""

After the analysis, Lamarr.AI's platform generates a report that includes the suspected root cause of every weak point found, an estimated cost to correct that problem, and its estimated return on investment using advanced building energy simulations.

""We knew if we were able to quickly, inexpensively, and accurately survey the thermal envelope of buildings and understand their performance, we would be addressing a huge need in the real estate, building construction, and built environment sectors,"" Fernández explains. ""Thermal anomalies are a huge cause of unwanted heat loss, and more than 45 percent of construction defects are tied to envelope failures.""

The ability to operate at scale is especially attractive to building owners and operators, who often manage large portfolios of buildings across multiple campuses.

""We see Lamarr.AI becoming the premier solution for building portfolio diagnostics and prognosis across the globe, where every building can be equipped not just for the climate crisis, but also to minimize energy losses and be more efficient, safer, and sustainable,"" Rakha says.

Building science for everyone

Lamarr.AI has worked with building operators across the U.S. as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.

In June, Lamarr.AI partnered with the City of Detroit, with support from Newlab and Michigan Central, to inspect three municipal buildings to identify areas for improvement. Across two of the buildings, the system identified more than 460 problems like insulation gaps and water leaks. The findings were presented in a report that also utilized energy simulations to demonstrate that upgrades, such as window replacements and targeted weatherization, could reduce HVAC energy use by up to 22 percent.

The entire process took a few days. The founders note that it was the first building inspection drone flight to utilize an off-site operator, an approach that further enhances the scalability of their platform. It also helps further reduce costs, which could make building scans available to a broader swath of people around the world.

""We're democratizing access to very high-value building science expertise that previously cost tens of thousands per audit,"" Bayomi says. ""Our platform makes advanced diagnostics affordable enough for routine use, not just one-time assessments. The bigger vision is automated, regular building health monitoring that keeps facilities teams informed in real-time, enabling proactive decisions rather than reactive crisis management. When building intelligence becomes continuous and accessible, operators can optimize performance systematically rather than waiting for problems to emerge.""",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202511/MIT-LamarrAI-01-press.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 15:01:01.466796

DHL currently operates some 39,000 EVs in pickup and delivery services, representing more than 41% of its fleet. The company plans to raise that proportion to 66% by 2030. New electric trucks and light commercial vehicles are to be deployed across all markets.

The company’s largest sources of emissions are air freight, road transport and facilities. Therefore, the company is investing heavily in technology, renewable energy and sustainable fuels.

“Our emissions peaked in 2021,” said Toby Groom, Global Head of EV Logistics Solutions. “If we want to hit these targets coming down from that 2021 number, we need to reduce our emissions significantly—and we have to have targeted measures to do that.”

“We doubled our electric vehicle fleet between 2021 and 2024,” said Groom. “But this isn’t just about mature markets—we’re rolling out electric vehicles globally. We need structurally sound energy systems to support them, powered by renewable sources, so we’re not shifting emissions from one scope to another.”

Groom acknowledged that electric truck adoption remains challenging: “An electric truck is still two to three times the price of a diesel truck, but that’s early in the evolution.”

DHL is also focusing on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), as air freight makes up 68% of its total emissions. SAF now represents 3.5% of DHL’s total jet fuel mix. The company has partnered with fuel producers including Neste and Shell to scale production and advocate for stronger policy support.

All new DHL buildings are designed to be carbon-neutral, incorporating solar power, heat pumps, automation, and energy-efficient systems. The company also operates EV Centres of Excellence, including three in Australia, to support fleet electrification, battery recycling and circular economy models.

Looking to 2050, DHL aims to decarbonize all transport modes. The company foresees that aviation will evolve from SAF to hydrogen and battery-electric aircraft. Early electric flight trials are already underway in the US. Shipping will depend on biofuels, methanol and ammonia.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/us-core-pr-03242021.web_.1592.896.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:11.511876

The termination will take effect on December 3.

According to Alliance, the contract termination stems from certain milestone dates not being met, making the existing agreement “inoperative”.

The company attributed the missed milestones chiefly to subdued nickel market conditions and the resulting difficulties in securing project financing.

Despite the termination, Alliance said Stellantis remains interested in the NiWest Project and has signalled a willingness to renegotiate offtake terms that would better align with a revised project development timetable and current market dynamics.

Alliance said it will provide further updates as discussions with Stellantis progress.

The company highlighted the nickel rout, noting the commodity’s prices have been under pressure for the past two years, a trend that has constrained funding for new nickel ventures worldwide.

Those conditions have forced the company to delay project development while it seeks suitable financing arrangements aimed at delivering shareholder value.

The company added it is weighing strategic options, including a potential special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction, which could lead to a Nasdaq listing.

Alliance managing director Paul Kopejtka said: “We understand the rationale for the Stellantis decision, and at the same time we recognise that this presents a good opportunity for both sides to negotiate on a new agreement which is more reflective of the revised project development timeline and forward strategy. I firmly believe that the long-term outlook for nickel and cobalt remains positive”

Stellantis and Alliance entered the supply agreement in 2023 for the delivery of 170,000t of nickel sulphate and 12,000t of cobalt sulphate over an initial five‑year term. That volume equated to roughly 40% of the NiWest project’s estimated annual output.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a September 2nd interpretive letter addressing the definition of “Begin Actual Construction” in the Clean Air Act New Source Review (“NSR”) regulations.

The September 2nd letter revised EPA’s view of the phrase “Begin Actual Construction” under the Clean Air Act NSR regulations.

The September 2nd letter arguably narrowed the scope of the phrase “begin actual construction.”

Three environmental organizations transmitted an October 30th letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin challenging the federal agency’s September 9th press release announcing the position, stating in part:

… In reality, there is no new EPA guidance document or rule allowing pre-permit construction. The link to “new guidance” in the above quote takes the reader to a page that says EPA “is providing guidance on a case-by-case basis and intends to propose and finalize a rule in 2026 that would revise the definition of ‘begin actual construction’ in EPA’s NSR regulations.” EPA’s intent to propose a new rule does not qualify as new guidance, and any case-by-case thoughts that EPA is providing is not nationwide guidance and does not have the force of law. Permitting authorities and permit applicants should not be misled into believing that EPA can weaken the Act’s restrictions by issuing a press release or sending letters to permitting agencies.

The organizations transmitting the letter include:

Earthjustice

Natural Resources Defense Council

Sierra Club

(Collectively, “Earthjustice”).

Earthjustice further states that EPA does not have the authority to allow any substantial onsite construction to start on major new polluting facilities without permits mandated by the Clean Air Act. They argue that the Clean Air Act does not limit the requirement for a preconstruction permit to:

… only an ‘emission unit’ in isolation.

The Clean Air Act is noted to bar pre-permit construction of “a major emitting facility” and “new or modified major sources” as opposed to just emission units.

Additional points put forth in the letter include:

In non-attainment areas pre-construction review must also weigh impacts from construction and location of the facility, as opposed to just the emission unit.

A permitting agency in a non-attainment area must determine that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification.

In attainment areas, in advance of any public hearing on whether to grant a construction permit, the agencies must weigh impacts of growth projected for the area and of emissions from facility construction activity on the site.

Earthjustice argues that EPA’s approach would unlawfully allow construction to commence at the facility site and for significant impacts to already occur before the required analyses have been conducted and subjected to a public hearing.

The rationale for pre-construction permitting is stated to also be designed to avoid bias in favor granting a permit merely because an applicant has already invested substantial time and money in site construction before the permitting decision.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:06.901704

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022, was a landmark piece of legislation that, among other things, linked renewable energy investment to high-quality, family-supporting jobs. It unleashed the rapid production of clean energy and created incentives for projects to pay fair wages and invest in registered apprenticeship programs that train workers for these essential careers.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed in July 2025, will terminate those incentives for wind and solar energy by the end of 2027, five years earlier than previously scheduled, with an exception for projects commencing construction by July 2026. This abrupt change threatens Maine’s growing clean-energy industry, and with it, the high-quality jobs and locally produced energy the IRA helped advance. In the wake of the new federal law, Maine lawmakers must take bold action to maintain progress towards producing more renewable energy, creating good jobs, and lowering prices for energy ratepayers.

Maine’s clean-energy footprint

According to the Climate Jobs National Resource Center, two years after the IRA’s passage, there were 129 incentive-eligible projects in Maine, in planning, under construction, or which had recently been completed. Those projects created more than 4,000 megawatts of clean power, $6.9 billion in associated investment, and more than 8,000 jobs. By May 2025, those figures had grown to an estimated 145 utility-scale projects, more than 9,100 jobs, and nearly 5,000 megawatts of power generation or storage.1 It remains to be seen how many of those projects will not come to fruition because of the new law, but workers in those trades reported a significant slowdown in jobs during negotiations and following passage of the OBBBA.

In addition to lost jobs, the termination of wind and solar energy credits is projected to significantly raise the cost of energy for ratepayers. Analysts project eliminating the IRA’s wind and solar tax credits would increase US household electricity rates by up to 10% or $400 per year by the year 2035.

Maine lawmakers can lead

With the federal government in gridlock, Maine must continue to lead toward creating good jobs while building out renewable energy infrastructure. Last session, lawmakers took important steps: creating the Department of Energy Resources and including prevailing wage requirements and incentives for Project Labor Agreements and utilization of registered apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship programs; and committing Maine to achieving 100% clean or renewable electricity by 2040. Here are ways lawmakers can continue that progress this session:

Develop a successor to the state’s solar subsidies. Last session, lawmakers voted to phase out Maine’s net energy billing system for community solar farms. While the program incentivized significant solar development, it failed to control costs for ratepayers or incentivize high-road labor standards. As lawmakers work toward a replacement to continue developing clean energy, the interests of consumers and workers must be front-and-center.

Expedite project permitting. Many renewable energy projects take years to get all the permits and approvals ready to even begin construction. Lawmakers should streamline and expedite the permitting and interconnection of clean energy and storage projects to deliver affordable energy to the grid more quickly. Strong labor standards should be attached to that expedited process to ensure quick delivery does not fall on the backs of workers.

Provide cheaper capital to lower costs. Lawmakers should utilize the state’s bonding authority to provide cheaper capital to clean energy development and grid modernization upgrades. This approach could simultaneously save ratepayers due to the lower capital costs compared to private financing sources and allow for stronger, enforceable labor standards on the work itself.

Create a public database of renewable energy projects. LD 1850, introduced by Rep. Kilton Webb, would task state agencies like the Public Utilities Commission and Department of Environmental Protection to propose a system that breaks down information siloes and improves coordination to advance renewable energy projects. The bill passed both legislative chambers but was held and awaits action by Governor Mills.

Proactively enforce existing standards. Existing laws include incentives for energy developers to use high-road labor standards to build future infrastructure. Since 2023, utility-scale renewable energy projects must pay prevailing wages, build out pre-apprenticeship programs, and are incentivized to sign Project Labor Agreements that improve project outcomes and costs. The Department of Labor should take a proactive approach in ensuring those commitments are being met.

Invest in pre-apprenticeship programs. The State has an important role in balancing the supply and demand of skilled workers to build out energy infrastructure. If we make long-term commitments to produce renewable energy in the state, Maine workers will seek careers in the sector. Pre-apprenticeship programs have proven effective at preparing workers for pay-while-you-learn apprenticeships that are critical for successfully completing utility-scale projects.

OEUK noted in the statement that, in the past year, more than 55 percent of the UK’s offshore energy firms have reduced their staff headcount, according to a Pulse survey OEUK conducted in October 2025.
OEUK’s Workforce Insight report highlights that the UK’s integrated energy workforce totals 154,000 people.
We should build the energy jobs of the future on the shoulders of energy workers today,” the OEUK representative continued.
OEUK describes itself on its website as the leading trade association for the UK offshore energy industry and a not for profit membership organization with a history stretching back five decades.","In a statement sent to Rigzone this week, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) noted that, according to its 2025 Workforce Insight report, the UK “could add thousands of jobs, retain economic value, and lead the world in energy with the right policies, collaborative action, and a focus on an integrated energy workforce”.

OEUK outlined in its statement that its new report provides “a blueprint for decision-makers and those navigating the expansion to a broader energy mix” and “details steps to equip the workforce for its essential role in supporting a low-carbon economy across oil and gas, offshore wind, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and hydrogen”.

“Highlighting the potential to grow jobs, ensure good jobs and guard existing jobs, OEUK calls for timely intervention to support a robust domestic energy sector, warning that inaction will lead to an unprecedented exodus of supply chain capability, continued job losses, further loss of critical expertise, and hinder progress toward the UK’s net zero targets,” OEUK said in the statement.

OEUK noted in the statement that, in the past year, more than 55 percent of the UK’s offshore energy firms have reduced their staff headcount, according to a Pulse survey OEUK conducted in October 2025. Looking ahead, nearly 45 percent of surveyed companies are expecting to cut jobs further over the next 12 months if the current policy environment continues, OEUK warned.

OEUK’s Workforce Insight report highlights that the UK’s integrated energy workforce totals 154,000 people. According to the report, there were a total of 40,023 offshore oil and gas workers in 2024, with the bulk of those, 17,957, based in Scotland. The report stated that the integrated energy workforce is highly skilled and adaptable, with around 90 percent of oil and gas competencies transferable to emerging energy fields.

“Ahead of the [UK] budget, OEUK has urged the government to reform the fiscal regime to secure investment, safeguard jobs, and strengthen the UK’s homegrown energy future, arguing that the choice is not between economic growth and climate ambition but how to deliver both,” OEUK said in the statement.

The budget, or financial statement, is a statement made to the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the nation’s finances and the government’s proposals for changes to taxation, the UK parliament website states, adding that the government has announced that the next budget will take place on Wednesday, November 26.

Katy Heidenreich, OEUK’s supply chain and people director, noted in the statement, “the government’s Clean Energy Jobs Plan presents an ambitious goal as the country works towards net zero emissions, energy security, and a strong economy”.

“It’s vital that we ground ambition in reality. The windfall tax is costing jobs and investment and reducing tax revenues that support families, communities, and vital services across the UK,” Heidenreich added.

“Nine out of ten supply chain companies believe growing their business is only possible by finding new markets outside the UK. Many of the renewable energy sector jobs will not materialize before 2030 and we must act now to avoid losing the skilled people who are essential to achieving the UK’s climate ambition,” Heidenreich said.

“We have an incredible opportunity, as we expand and diversify our energy mix across oil and gas, wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. We should build the energy jobs of the future on the shoulders of energy workers today,” the OEUK representative continued.

“With the right policies and investment, the UK can achieve a net addition of jobs, growing the offshore energy workforce from 154,000 today to over 212,000 by 2030, with continued growth in oil and gas playing a central role. OEUK and its members are ready to lead but success depends on decisive action from government, industry, and academia,” Heidenreich went on to state.

Rigzone has contacted the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and HM Treasury (HMT) for comment on OEUK’s statement and Workforce Insight report. At the time of writing, neither have responded to Rigzone.

In a statement made on March 5, which was posted on the UK parliament website, James Murray, now Chief Secretary to the Treasury, noted that the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced in 2022 “in response to extraordinary profits made by oil and gas companies driven by global events, including resurgent demand for energy post-Covid 19 and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia”.

“The EPL will end in 2030, or earlier if the EPL’s price floor, the Energy Security Investment Mechanism, is triggered,” the statement added.

In that statement, Murray highlighted that HMT and HM Revenue and Customs had published a consultation on how the oil and gas fiscal regime “will respond to future oil and gas price shocks once the EPL ends”. The consultation closed on May 28.

In his view, federal funding “makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”

Many see hydrogen as necessary for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify operations, such as steel and glassmaking, as well as some transportation sectors.

Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.

The Biden administration’s hub initiative meant to change that by bringing down the cost of low-carbon hydrogen, which can be produced with renewable energy, nuclear power, or natural gas with carbon capture and storage.

The initiative sparked detailed planning for dozens of projects throughout the hub regions. In Ohio, proposals took on different shapes: One developer wanted to use solar power to make hydrogen for buses in Stark County, while another planned to derive the fuel from a chemical plant’s waste stream. Still others looked to expand storage and refueling operations in central and northeastern Ohio.

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act also created a lucrative federal tax credit for clean-hydrogen projects, an incentive that successful lobbying preserved through the end of 2027 in Republicans’ massive budget bill signed into law in July. But even with this federal support in place, the nascent industry has been on shaky ground. Some high-profile green-hydrogen projects were already floundering before this year.

The Trump administration’s October cancellation of federal dollars for two of the hubs that focused on hydrogen from renewable energy raised urgent questions about the viability of many hydrogen ventures nationwide.

The fate of the other five hubs remains uncertain. Last month, their names appeared on a leaked Energy Department list alongside a note to “terminate,” but the DOE has not confirmed their status.

Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.

There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.

“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.

At the outset, though, the systems planned in central Ohio for Amazon Data Services and Cologix Johnstown will run on natural gas. Eventually, AEP has said, they could switch to run on hydrogen.

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.

Hydrogen also features in vehicle offerings from American Honda Motor Co. Although its hybrid cars that can use either hydrogen or battery electric power are built in Marysville, most of them go to California.

In general, battery-powered electric vehicles are probably the best option for “small mobility,” said Gary Robinson, vice president of sustainability and business development for the company. Indeed, hydrogen cars remain niche at best. But “trucks, buses, industrial equipment — all of those things, in our opinion, are perfect candidates for hydrogen,” Robinson said. The company is exploring shipping and aviation as other potential markets for fuel cells.

Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.

Dayton-based Millennium Reign Energy supplied electrolyzer equipment to provide initial fill-ups for the fuel-cell hybrids that Honda has made in Marysville since last year, and it has provided fueling equipment to other locations in the United States and abroad. The company plans to add two fueling stations for its Emerald H2 network in the Dayton area by April, CEO Chris McWhinney told Canary Media.

Plug Power also relies on electrolyzers to produce its hydrogen. The 28-year-old company’s first big order back in 2007 was for fuel cells to power pallet trucks at a Walmart distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio, said Mike Ahearn, vice president for North American service. He did not talk about projects the company would do as part of ARCH2, if it moves ahead, but he did describe work outside of Ohio.

Plug Power remains on track to start construction next year on a wind-powered hydrogen plant capable of producing around 45 tons per day in Graham, Texas.

“We are on a good trajectory,” Ahearn said, adding that the company’s goal is to turn a profit next year — something it hasn’t done yet over its almost three decades in operation.

Independence Hydrogen, another ARCH2 project-development partner, concentrates on local hydrogen production and distribution. While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.

The company’s method of making the alternative fuel doesn’t fit neatly on the “hydrogen rainbow” that indicates whether production relies on renewable energy or fossil fuels.

Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen. Independence Hydrogen would basically “clean up” the gas by removing water and other impurities and then compress it for transport.

But “I need an offtaker,” said William Lehner, chief strategy officer for the company. “We would love to provide that project.”

Indeed, most companies at last week’s symposium would love more customers, but it’s unclear how quickly interest in the alternative fuel will ramp up if federal funding for ARCH2 and other hydrogen hubs remains in limbo and if tax incentives aren’t extended further.

The DOE’s “hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031. While developers would still cover at least half the project costs at the hubs, federal grants would have reduced total expenses and let them charge customers less for their hydrogen. The hope was that the lower prices would stoke demand.

The Trump administration’s actions to dismantle decarbonization policy also raise questions about clean hydrogen’s future. Without sticks that punish greenhouse gas emissions or carrots that make zero- and low-carbon fuels cheaper, a lot of projects face a difficult road ahead.",https://s3-prod.crainscleveland.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/H2%20with%20renewables_i.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:20.001143

OPAL Fuels missed Wall Street’s revenue targets last quarter but drew attention by increasing renewable natural gas production and securing fresh capital from strategic tax credit sales.

What does this mean?

OPAL Fuels reported $83.36 million in revenue for the third quarter of 2025, just under the $93.07 million consensus and down 1% from a year ago. While the top line was light, the company’s adjusted EBITDA edged past expectations, showing solid cost control at $19.46 million, a touch above estimates. Despite facing softer pricing for D3 RIN credits—a key industry benchmark—OPAL Fuels stuck with its full-year guidance, underscoring management’s confidence. Operationally, renewables output jumped 30% year-over-year, highlighted by the kickoff of new projects like Atlantic RNG and CMS RNG. On the financial side, the firm wrapped up its fourth investment tax credit sale under the Inflation Reduction Act, pocketing over $40 million and setting itself up to tap into new production tax credits before year-end.

Why should I care?

For markets: Mixed signals on clean fuel momentum.

OPAL Fuels ended November 6 trading at $2.02 per share and just 3 times expected earnings over the next year, a drop from earlier this year that shows investor caution. The analyst consensus is split, but a median 12-month price target of $3.50 hints at potential upside if the company delivers on policy-driven growth. Still, muted D3 RIN prices and a split view across renewable fuel peers suggest that investor sentiment around the clean fuel transition remains a bit hesitant.

The bigger picture: Policy tailwinds keep green gas flowing.

Major US policies like the Inflation Reduction Act and the new 45Z production tax credits are shoring up the renewable natural gas sector even as pricing pressure lingers. OPAL Fuels’ recent tax credit windfall and its readiness to tap more credits highlight the stronger financial safety net now available for clean energy firms.

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Campaign begins with Yam Jam, a volunteer event in Greenville that packages 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for holiday food boxes

GREENVILLE, S.C., Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That's why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

The big picture: Starting this week, Duke Energy with support from Duke Energy Foundation launches the company's annual monthlong campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities across the state.

The initiative will provide over $600,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

This year's campaign also consists of a contribution of $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: Food pantries and rainy-day funds are drained, and many are unsure when government funding will be available. Though many donors and relief efforts like the One SC Fund have stepped up to support them, many communities still need an extra hand.

Zoom in: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That's 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

Bottom line: Throughout November, Duke Energy will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others.

The monthlong campaign began Nov. 6, when Duke Energy joined Mill Village Farms, WYFF, Bon Secours Wellness Arena and nearly 200 volunteers from dozens of companies and organizations around Greenville to bag nearly 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving food boxes to be distributed by FoodShare South Carolina hubs and other food programs across South Carolina.

Additionally, Duke Energy Foundation contributed $105,000 to FoodShare South Carolina organizations across the company's service territory, including $39,000 to Mill Village Farms.

What they're saying

Dan Weidenbenner, executive director of Mill Village Farms and Mill Village Ministries: ""As we enter the holiday season, Mill Village Ministries remains steadfast in our commitment to ensuring food access for every resident in our community. In the wake of reduced federal support, Mill Village Farms' FoodShare program is stepping up to fill the gap – bringing fresh, affordable produce directly to neighborhoods where it's needed most. Thanks to the continued partnership of Duke Energy and the generosity of our community, we're able to stand in the gap for our neighbors and make sure everyone has access to the healthy food they deserve.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""Our hope is by shining a light on these organizations they will continue to receive the support they need to help address the real problem of hunger in our communities. They are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but now more than ever they cannot do it alone.""

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

Now, we’re bringing our first operations online at our South Carolina campus, adding an initial 20,000 metric tons of annual materials production.
The same critical minerals that power batteries also underpin the technologies that keep the nation running and secure.
On our 600-acre campus in Berkeley County, South Carolina, operations have begun, with the first facility now recovering critical minerals.
Over the next decade, Redwood will continue to grow in South Carolina, creating more than 1,500 good-paying jobs.","America runs on critical materials: cobalt, lithium, nickel, and copper. They are the backbone of our modern economy, powering everything from computers and smartphones to energy storage, defense systems, and AI data centers. Yet today, the United States imports nearly all of these minerals, often from unstable regions or adversarial nations.

Redwood’s mission is to change this.

Today, Redwood is on par with the largest U.S. source of nickel and stands as the only domestic source of cobalt at scale. Our operations also represent one of the most significant, and only new, domestic sources of lithium and copper to come online in decades. With roughly 90% of all lithium-ion batteries processed in North America coming through our facilities, Redwood’s Nevada Campus produced more than 60,000 metric tons of materials last year—making it one of the nation’s most important sources of critical minerals, mined or recycled. Now, we’re bringing our first operations online at our South Carolina campus, adding an initial 20,000 metric tons of annual materials production.

Critical minerals are costly to mine and concentrated in fragile supply chains dominated by China. Yet as one of the world’s largest markets for EVs, consumer electronics, and power tools, America already holds a tremendous stockpile of lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese locked inside the products we use every day. Within the U.S. fleet of five million electric vehicles alone lies an estimated 2.25 million metric tons of these materials—resources we can unlock first through reuse in stationary storage systems and later through recovery of the underlying minerals.

Redwood’s goal is to keep these resources here; recovered, refined, and redeployed for America’s advantage. This strategy turns yesterday’s imports into tomorrow’s strategic stockpile, making the U.S. stronger, more competitive, and less vulnerable to supply chains controlled by China and other foreign adversaries.

This isn’t just an economic issue; it’s a matter of national security. The same critical minerals that power batteries also underpin the technologies that keep the nation running and secure. Nickel and cobalt are also essential for aerospace and defense alloys, while copper forms the backbone of industrial wiring and power transmission. Even semiconductors and advanced electronics rely on cobalt and copper in their manufacturing processes. Redwood is providing domestic access to these materials, ensuring the U.S. maintains the resources needed for military readiness, technological leadership, and energy resilience here at home.

On our 600-acre campus in Berkeley County, South Carolina, operations have begun, with the first facility now recovering critical minerals. This is a small but significant start toward what will become one of the world’s largest recovery, refining, and manufacturing campuses. Over the next decade, Redwood will continue to grow in South Carolina, creating more than 1,500 good-paying jobs.

South Carolina has long been a leader in advanced manufacturing—from textiles to automotive to aerospace. With Redwood’s campus ramping up, the state is taking its next step into critical minerals. By keeping these resources at home, South Carolina is strengthening both the state and the nation—rebuilding American industry through high-value manufacturing, energy security, and local job creation.

By recovering critical minerals at scale, we’re building the foundation for American leadership in advanced manufacturing, infrastructure, and the high-power technologies of tomorrow. With recycling operations now online in South Carolina, Redwood helping transform the U.S. into a nation that can secure and reuse its own resources.

EV truck sales have dropped industry-wide, prompting automakers to rethink large vehicle electrification strategies.

The expiration of tax credits and rising costs have led to declining consumer interest in full-size EVs.

Ford is evaluating whether to discontinue the electric version of its F-150 pickup, the Lightning. Persistent losses and lagging demand in the full-size electric truck segment have sparked the internal debate. According to people familiar with the matter, discussions are ongoing, though no final decision has been made.

The automaker paused production of the F-150 Lightning last month, citing an aluminum shortage, and is now considering whether to keep the plant idle as it reassesses its EV strategy. Ford has posted approximately $13 billion in losses tied to its EV operations since 2023.

Comparison: 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning vs 2026 GMC Sierra EV

Despite being marketed as a milestone vehicle for Ford, the Lightning has struggled to attract mainstream truck buyers. In October, Ford reported selling only 1,500 Lightnings in the U.S., compared to 66,000 gasoline-powered F-Series pickups. EV sales across the industry have also slowed in the wake of expiring government incentives, with larger trucks and SUVs being particularly affected.

Ford is not alone in reconsidering its EV truck plans. Stellantis cancelled its planned electric Ram 1500 earlier this year. General Motors has paused production at a Detroit facility that assembles electric trucks, stopped BrightDrop production at its CAMI plant in Ontario, and is reviewing the future of its electric pickup portfolio. Tesla’s Cybertruck has experienced declining sales, and EV startup Rivian has reduced its workforce to conserve cash.

The retreat from electric pickups is a generalized shift in EV strategy among North American automakers. Ford CEO Jim Farley has acknowledged the limitations of full-size EVs for extended driving and towing, pointing instead to hybrid systems and smaller EVs as the more viable options for most consumers. Ford is currently developing a compact $30,000 electric pickup aimed at addressing affordability concerns.

Ford Midsize EV Pickup Enters Testing Ahead of 2027 Production Launch

Originally launched as a flagship electric vehicle, the F-150 Lightning was introduced with promises of sports car acceleration, jobsite utility, and backup power capabilities. Early production targets suggested the company could manufacture up to 150,000 units annually. However, with base models priced closer to $50,000 ($63,000 CDN) and premium versions nearing $90,000 ($104,000 CDN), cost became a major barrier for many prospective buyers.

The high development and manufacturing costs of full-size EV trucks, combined with reduced government support and uncertain consumer uptake, have prompted automakers to rethink long-term plans. GM set aside $1.6 billion in the third quarter to cover EV-related losses and warned of additional charges in the future.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone.","California has long cast itself as the nation’s climate conscience — and its policy lab.

Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.

Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy.

While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.

Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Authority states have never had before

A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act – who is also a law professor at UCLA – first floated this idea.

Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”

The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”

Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.

Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”

In other words, she says, preemption has its limits.

Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering.

Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them.

Not a slam dunk for California to step in

For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.

“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”

California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.

UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”

California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.

The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung peoples’ eyes.

In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.

In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.

Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.

“So this wouldn’t necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.

Targeting cars with new regulation

If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.

California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”

Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.

Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.

If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.

California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.

The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort. Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals. “

“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.

“It’s something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.

No downside to trying, and some upsides

Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice.

“There’s a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You’re buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don’t think there’s much downside in trying to do it.”

Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.

California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.

The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a “no-win, Catch 22.”

After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars.

“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That’s usually a flag for policymakers.”

Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.

With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.

“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who’s serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world’s fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030223_los-altos-ev_sk_cm_161762530432.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=xN6dI3Go,N,,2025-11-07 11:08:59.162337

The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.
The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs.
“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.
States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.","Washington — Near the end of his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that aimed to reduce harmful, planet-warming pollutants emitted by refrigerators and air conditioners. The bipartisan measure brought environmentalists and major business groups into rare alignment on the contentious issue of climate change and won praise across the political spectrum.

Five years later, the second Trump administration is reversing course, as it moves to loosen a federal rule — based on the 2020 law — that requires grocery stores, air-conditioning companies and others to reduce powerful greenhouse gases used in cooling equipment.

The shift in approach has upended a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to quickly phase out domestic use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and are considered a major driver of global warming.

The proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency highlights the second Trump administration's drive to roll back regulations perceived as climate-friendly, even at the cost of causing disarray for the very business interests it is claiming to protect. The plan is among a series of sweeping environmental rollbacks that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said will put a “dagger through the heart of climate change religion.”

The HFC proposal will help “make American refrigerants affordable, safe and reliable again,” Zeldin said in a statement.

But environmentalists say the plan will exacerbate climate pollution while disrupting a years-long industry transition to new coolants as an alternative to HFCs.

With HFCs one of the main drivers of extreme heat and pollution, any delay in their phaseout “is going to be have negative outcomes and significant ones,” said Kiff Gallagher, executive director of the Global Heat Reduction Initiative, an international effort to reduce trapped heat that is warming the planet.

Industry groups supported the phaseout

The 2020 law signed by Trump, known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, phased out HFCs as part of an international agreement on ozone pollution. The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chemistry Council, the top lobbying group for the chemical industry, were among numerous business groups that supported the law and an international deal on pollutants, known as the Kigali Amendment, as wins for jobs and the environment. U.S. companies such as Chemours and Honeywell developed and produce the alternative refrigerants sold in the U.S. and around the world.

The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs. Zeldin said the Biden-era rule did not give companies enough time to comply and the rapid switch to other refrigerants had caused shortages and price hikes. Some in the industry dispute this.

In September, the EPA announced it is relaxing standards for cold storage warehouses and other cooling equipment and delaying other aspects of the HFC rule until 2032.

EPA now says the rule is bad for business

On a visit this summer to a refrigeration facility in swing-state Georgia alongside Vice President JD Vance, Zeldin said the administration was responding to grocery stores and refrigeration companies that have complained about the federal rule.

“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.

Zeldin said the so-called Technology Transitions Rule, finalized under former President Joe Biden, has been restricting access to refrigerants Americans need to cool their homes and businesses, while costs are going up and supply is going down.

He said Alta Refrigeration, along with grocery stores, the semiconductor industry and residents across America, were dissatisfied with the rule and vowed to “fix this mistake.”

The Food Industry Association, which represents grocery stores and suppliers, applauded the EPA plan, saying the current rule “imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines.” Zeldin’s proposal “achieves the intended environmental benefits without placing unnecessary and costly burdens on the food industry,” said Leslie Sarasin, the group’s president and CEO.

Jorge Alvarez, co-founder of iGas USA, a Florida air conditioning company whose products include HFCs, said the Biden rule was “shoved down our throats” and threatened to create havoc. The delay “gives industry a chance to create new refrigerants, and we will,” he said.

The rule's rollback sparks confusion over Trump's strategy

But the change in tack comes after industry players had already made adjustments to ensure they could meet the goals set in motion by the 2020 law.

“Changing the schedule now would disrupt planning and inject uncertainty across the market,” said Samantha Slater, a senior vice president at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, which represents more than 330 HVAC manufacturers and commercial refrigeration companies.

Manufacturers have already retooled product lines and certified models based on the current timeline, she said, noting that nearly 90% of residential and light commercial air conditioning systems use substitute refrigerants.

A delay would give an advantage to foreign-based competitors that did not invest in alternative refrigerants and risks “higher costs for U.S. consumers,” Slater said.

Chemours, the Delaware-based chemical giant that is a leading producer of alternative refrigerants, said in a statement that it has “consistently supported an orderly phasedown schedule of HFCs as outlined in the AIM Act.''

Delays to the transition “risk undermining and stranding U.S. manufacturing and innovation investments, while also increasing uncertainty and supply chain inefficiencies, ultimately driving up consumer costs,'' said Joe Martinko, president of Chemours’ Thermal & Specialized Solutions business.

Even with the holdup, “the transition to low-global warming potential refrigerants is well underway,'' he said.

A temporary shortage this summer of cylinders used by HVAC contractors — which Zeldin and others have cited as a reason to delay the EPA rule — has been resolved, Martinko and other industry representatives said.

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the current rule ensures an efficient, affordable phasedown of harmful HFCs, while offering industry regulatory uniformity and a way to remain globally competitive.

He said the federal rule averts a previous patchwork of state laws and regulations. States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.

“Weakening the rule will confuse the market,'' he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87144864007-ap-25310819301268.jpg?crop=3299,1856,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-07 11:07:49.835113

In order to fulfil their duties to their investors and for risk management purposes, asset managers must take into account sustainability risks that may impact fund performance.","The pace of change with regard to attitudes, laws and regulations on climate change matters in the ten years since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 has been head spinning. In the early years of the past decade, there appeared to be a growing international consensus on the need to finance the transition to net zero. In its ambitious Sustainable Finance Action Plan, published in 2018, the European Union (""EU"") sought to position itself as a global leader in the area of sustainable finance, introducing a complex framework of new disclosure rules intended to provide investors with the information they needed to make investments aligned with their sustainability goals. In the US, at a federal level, the SEC proposed rules aiming to standardise how companies report their climate-related risks and impacts, while a large number of states introduced sustainability reporting regulations. The Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") introduced significant tax incentives to facilitate the transition towards sustainable energy.

In more recent years, we have seen the US's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and denouncement of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (""SDGs""), legal challenges to the SEC's proposed corporate disclosure rules, ultimately leading to their defence being abandoned earlier this year, and a significant rollback on the clean energy tax credits and other climate-related provisions in the IRA. A number of US states have implemented policies to restrict ESG considerations in state investments, requiring investment decisions to be based solely on financial considerations, and ""blacklisting"" asset managers deemed to be boycotting fossil fuels. A number of asset managers have withdrawn from climate initiatives such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which had launched as recently as 2020 but suspended its activities in January of this year.

The EU's Ongoing Commitment

The ""ESG backlash"" and change in the administration in the US coincided with the reconstitution of the European Commission in 2024, a year in which both the Letta1 and Draghi2 reports on the future of the EU's single market and on EU competitiveness were published. The EU's renewed focus on competitiveness and growth posed questions as to whether the EU would pursue its European Green Deal with continued zeal, particularly in light of the prospect of increasing deregulation across the Atlantic. President von der Leyen's mission letter3 to Commissioner Albuquerque reaffirmed the Commission's climate objectives, including its goal to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050, and its commitment to the UN SDGs and the Green Deal. The letter made it clear that the EU intends to remain a global leader in sustainable finance, referring to scaling up sustainable finance, in particular transition finance and climate resilience.

The Simplification Agenda

Notably, the mission letter also referred to the Commission's focus on reducing administrative burdens and simplifying legislation, including reducing reporting obligations by at least 25%. The new Commission acted with purpose in this regard, publishing the Omnibus I proposal in February of this year, which includes proposals to significantly reduce the scope of the reporting requirements under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (""CSRD"") and proposed amendments to reporting obligations under the Taxonomy Regulation. While the proposals have been described by the Commission as 'simplification' rather than 'deregulation' efforts, the effect of the proposals, if adopted, would be to significantly scale-back CSRD reporting obligations, with 80% of companies taken out of scope and a twoyear delay to reporting for those that would continue to be subject to the CSRD.4

From a burden reduction perspective, the CSRD changes will no doubt be welcomed by many EU companies. However, reduced sustainability reporting poses challenges to fund managers already dealing with significant data challenges in meeting their obligations under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (""SFDR"") and the Taxonomy Regulation. To fill the data gap, fund managers will have to continue to rely on ESG data and ratings sold by third-party providers, potentially increasing costs for investors. The fact that ESG data providers remain unregulated at EU level, and that ESG data is not standardised and often incomparable, adds to the compliance challenges for asset managers. The lack of available, reliable data will likely lead to the increased use of estimates in meeting disclosure obligations, which, in the absence of clear guidance on the use of such estimates, may increase the risk of greenwashing and undermine the trust and confidence of investors in the financial system.

Recognising that the ""regulatory burden has become a brake on Europe's competitiveness"",5 the Commission's simplification agenda includes proposals to address the issue of fragmentation and the unnecessary duplication of regulatory burdens, particularly the barriers and costs relating to operating group structures across EU member states and to the distribution of investment funds across the EU, with legislative proposals expected later this year.6

The review of the SFDR, one of the cornerstones of the EU's sustainable finance framework, does not fit neatly into this new simplification and burden reduction agenda. Work on the review of the SFDR commenced in 2023, prior to the publication of the Draghi report and the reconstitution of the Commission, and the introduction of a new product classification regime to replace the current disclosure regime is difficult to reconcile with a simplification objective. While criticisms of the current SFDR censuring the complexity of the disclosures for retail investors and questioning the usefulness of the disclosures for professional investors are warranted, asset managers have already incurred significant compliance costs and made substantial changes in order to comply with the disclosure regime and are now faced with a further potentially significant overhaul of the framework.

One of the most notable challenges in implementing the SFDR related to the misalignment in timing of the introduction of obligations. For example, the EU imposed detailed disclosure obligations on market participants at a time when there were no corresponding reporting obligations on investee companies, creating significant data gaps and resulting in less comparable, comprehensible disclosures for investors, undermining the purpose of the EU disclosure regime. The proposed reduced scope of the CSRD is likely to compound these challenges. There continues to be misalignment between the SFDR, the Taxonomy Regulation and the provisions relating to investor's sustainability preferences in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (""MiFID""). A more coherent, consistent framework should be the objective of an holistic approach to the Omnibus I Proposal, the SFDR review and a future review of MiFID.

What do investors have to say?

In addition to diverging policy and regulatory approaches with regard to ESG reporting and disclosures, there may also be divergence in investor preferences between the EU and US. In both jurisdictions, the geopolitical environment has drawn attention away from sustainability issues and towards economic growth, competitiveness and defence. While assets in global ESG funds ended 2024 8% higher than in 2023 to reach an annual record high of $3.2 trillion, inflows had been declining in the three years prior to 2025, and redemptions were at a record high of $11.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025 globally. While not representative of an established pattern, in the second quarter of 2025, European investors drove a recovery in sustainable funds, investing $8.6 billion of net new money into ESG funds over those three months, after redeeming $7.3 billion in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, the US saw the eleventh consecutive quarter of withdrawals.7

There has also been a marked difference between the EU and the US in relation to the level of support for shareholder resolutions with an ESG objective, with asset managers in the UK and Europe supporting 81% of shareholder ESG proposals on average in 2024, compared with 25% support in the US.8 New restrictions on permissible shareholder resolutions introduced by the SEC earlier this year preceded a sharp fall in the number of environmental and social proposals submitted to shareholder vote. Arguably, this could impact US companies' insight into the market's view of financially material ESG themes.9

There have been instances of EU pension funds withdrawing from or reviewing mandates with asset managers that have revised their ESG credentials or withdrawn from climate initiatives such as NZAM and Climate Action 100+. Although it may be too early to determine whether this is the ""early phase of a broader movement"", European pension funds and other long-term asset owners remain committed to sustainable investing.10

Closing Comment

As the political debate continues regarding issues such as climate change, DEI and whether defence investment is compatible with ESG principles, from a market participant's perspective, the future direction for ESG and sustainable finance is arguably less about values and principles and more about reputational management, satisfying investor demand for opportunities meeting their preferences, and the need for greater regulatory alignment.

In order to fulfil their duties to their investors and for risk management purposes, asset managers must take into account sustainability risks that may impact fund performance. While the EU devised its sustainable finance framework with a view to channelling capital towards sustainable investments to assist the EU in meeting its 2050 net zero target, from a purely market-driven point of view, investors ought to be given the opportunity to benefit from climate adaptation as an investment strategy, giving investors access to investment returns from companies and projects that promote and progress the transition.

It is often argued that the US innovates while the EU regulates, but it must be remembered that regulation in itself is not inherently bad, as attested by the asset managers who lobbied for and supported the introduction of the US Investment Companies Act 1940 and who saw the benefits regulation brought to the collective reputation of the industry and the enhanced trust it engendered. Accepting that regulation can bring benefits to an industry, there is, however, a need for alignment between the various legislative and regulatory initiatives contributing to the EU's sustainable finance agenda, to ensure that the complexities and costs of compliance do not undermine EU competitiveness.

(FANCO) is planning what could eventually amount to a $4-billion investment in Indiana. The massive program will encompass a new headquarters, as well as manufacturing facilities and an energy park, and fund the development of FANCO’s small modular reactor (SMR) technology, the company announced.

The Indiana energy park will be the first in the United States to operate in a “closed-fuel cycle,” a system that reprocesses and reuses spent nuclear fuel on-site, according to the company. Boasting that SMR can “deliver the most cost-effective utility-scale power in the world,” FANCO says its flagship EAGL-1 SMR can create more fuel than it burns, resulting in clean, renewable nuclear energy.

Using a liquid-metal alloy called lead bismuth for cooling, the EAGL-1 is able to generate 240 megawatts of electricity—enough to power 1.5 million homes from the typical six-reactor cluster, with one-tenth the footprint of traditional nuclear power plants producing similar wattage, the company notes.

Initially, however, the plant will use natural gas to produce power, CEO Mike Reinboth told the Indianapolis Business Journal. The transition to nuclear power production is expected to happen early next decade. But skeptics pointed out that SMR is largely unproven and costly.

Indiana has put in place a 20% tax credit for businesses developing SMR technology, American Machinist reports. FANCO aims to establish an office in Indiana by early 2026 but hasn’t finalized site selection for the project.

Rivian posted positive gross profit but still projects a massive loss for the full year.

The quarter benefited from a rush before EV tax credits expired, creating near-term air-pocket risk.

Rivian's upcoming R2 launch could help sales. But it will likely weigh on the bottom line.

10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›

Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) ripped higher after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results this week. The stock rose more than 23% on Wednesday. With shares still down massively from levels five years ago (even after Wednesday's rise), it is fair to ask whether the move signals something more durable -- or if it's just noise.

Sure, the electric vehicle company did give investors some things to be excited about. For instance, revenue growth accelerated sharply, and gross profit turned positive for the quarter. In addition, it was good to hear that the company's upcoming lower-priced model, the R2, is slated to hit the market in the first half of 2026. Overall, however, significant concerns remain.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Here are three reasons I'd stay on the sidelines for now -- despite the strong results.

Profit is still a long way off

Rivian reported third-quarter revenue of about $1.56 billion, up 78% year over year, and generated $24 million of gross profit -- a welcome milestone after a long stretch of losses.

While the improvement is notable, gross profit isn't a bottom-line figure. Move down to the lowest line on the income statement, after all the expenses are accounted for, and you'll see a staggering loss of $1.17 billion -- worse than the $1.1 billion loss in the year-ago quarter.

Additionally, management still expects a full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of roughly $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion.

Negative cash flow

The company's cash flow statement isn't pretty either. While Rivian generated $26 million in cash from operations in the quarter, capital expenditures were $447 million, up from $227 million in the year-ago period -- an increase management attributed to investments in expanding production capacity. This means free cash flow for the quarter was negative $421 million.

While the company does boast more than $7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, Rivian is clearly far from being cash generative -- so it's either going to need to burn through this cash in the coming years or raise more cash by taking on debt or diluting shareholders by selling equity.

In 2025 alone, Rivian expects capital expenditures to total between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion.

A demand air pocket

Rivian's quarterly strength was helped by U.S. buyers rushing to capture federal EV tax credits before they expired on Sept. 30. In other words, there was a significant pull-forward in demand. To this end, management expects a huge step down in deliveries for the final quarter of the year; the mid-point of the company's full-year vehicle delivery guidance range implies about 10,000 deliveries in Q4, down from just over 13,200 in Q3 and about even with the year-ago period -- not the sort of growth profile you want from a company operating with massive losses.

So, is the stock's big gain the beginning of a longer-term upward move? While there's no way to know what a stock will do in the future, I personally wouldn't bet on good returns from here. The stock's nearly $19 billion market cap, even as Rivian burns through cash, just isn't a compelling investment thesis. Indeed, given the capital intensity of its business, it wouldn't be surprising to see losses accelerate as production of a lower-priced model ramps up next year.

With all of this said, I would consider changing my mind if sales growth begins accelerating on a more consistent basis next year. But I'd need to see signs of significant improvement in profitability, too. Additionally, I might consider the stock if it were cheaper; to convince me to invest in a risky, capital-intensive operation, I'm going to need a really good deal.

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world’s most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, being showcased Friday at the COP30 climate summit, provides political support for expanding biofuels and relatively low-emission hydrogen-based fuels. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

India’s rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India’s northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

Mann said prices for sugarcane have also dropped this year. He said it’s good that the government is tackling climate change, but it should put farmers and their prices ahead of ethanol mandates.

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India’s ethanol, but that’s beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP. “With the push for E20 blends or even more, a lot more area has to be cultivated which in turn means it’ll be replacing other crops,” she said.

Balancing India’s needs

Climate experts said biofuel production can have minimal environmental impact when it’s made from waste or inedible vegetation and processed in facilities that run on clean energy. But when crops are grown explicitly for biofuels, it has a higher carbon footprint because of the fertilizer and fuel involved.

India’s ethanol strategy is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions, cut oil imports and boost agriculture, said Purva Jain, an energy specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But she said a faster transition to infrastructure for electric vehicles might be better. A 2022 study by her organization found that installing solar power for EV charging can be a much more efficient land use than growing crops for biofuel.

However, ethanol producers have invested significant sums in manufacturing and need a steady, growing market for their product now, said CK Jain, president of the Grain Ethanol Manufacturers Association. He said India should increase the percentage of ethanol mixed with gas and encourage the sale of compatible vehicles.

“We need to have higher blending as soon as possible, otherwise the industry will go into deep financial trouble,” Jain said.

Other experts advocated for a middle ground.

A 10% blend of ethanol with gasoline, can be a “win-win” solution said Natarajan of CSTEP. She said that would allow for use of existing crops without putting too much pressure on increased cultivation.

Khare, the YouTube influencer, said keeping lower blends available would help older vehicles.

“The government can bring E20 or even up to E85 programs on top of that, that’s completely fine. But consumers need to be given the option,” he said.

Speaking last year at COP29 in Azerbaijan – another major crude oil producer – Lula said he wanted to continue to increase Brazil’s oil exports to 36 percent by 2035.

“It’s a contradiction that the Brazilian president is more or less owning up to,” Aubertin said.
True to form, the Brazilian president seems to have carefully sidestepped the awkward issue of fossil fuels for the moment.","Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has worked hard to cultivate a reputation as a staunch defender of the climate. Speaking at his 2023 inauguration, Lula promised to turn his country into “a leader in the fight against the climate crisis”.

And there have been some notable successes: last month, Amazon deforestation hit an 11-year low.

These lofty ambitions will be on full display as Brazil prepares to host the COP30 climate summit in the port city of Belem on the edge of the sprawling Amazon.

But barely three weeks earlier, Brazil's majority state-owned oil giant Petrobas announced that it had received approval to drill exploratory oil wells at the mouth of the Amazon River. The decision had many environmental activists criticising this apparent paradox at the heart of Lula’s climate policy.

“Brazil's presidency of COP30 is hypocritical, as it claims to want to raise climate ambitions while granting a new oil exploration license to its national company,” said Fanny Petitbon, France director of the 350.org clean energy NGO.

“It's completely mind-boggling.”

Brazilian activists were also quick to condemn the decision.

“The approval is an act of sabotage against the COP and undermines the climate leadership claimed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,” the country's Climate Observatory said in a statement.

Black gold

Petrobas has for decades been eyeing this stretch of water in what’s known as the Equatorial Margin, some 500 kilometres from the mouth of the Amazon River. And with good reason – like similar swaths of territory off the coasts of neighbouring Suriname and Guyana, it holds vast reserves of oil. Brazilian authorities estimate that the black gold buried beneath these waters could bring in €46 billion and create more than 350,000 new jobs.

Although the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has long baulked at the project, it finally gave its approval after what it described as a “rigorous process” with “more than 65 technical consultations”.

But the project is far from risk-free, either for the region’s biodiversity or the communities living along the coast. In a technical report published by Brazilian daily Folha de São Paulo, IBAMA found that the drilling could have dire repercussions for the manatees that call the coast home – mammals that are already facing the risk of extinction.

The region is also home to the largest expanse of mangroves in the world – a fragile ecosystem that Brazil Journal said is also threatened by the project. The Equatorial Margin’s coast also harbours three Indigenous lands and six quilombola territories – peopled by the descendants of African slaves – as well as countless fishing villages that would be the first to bear the brunt of any oil spills or other industrial accidents.

Up in smoke

So why was such a project approved under a self-proclaimed climate defender such as Lula?

“This sums up the duality of the Brazilian president, caught between economic and ecological interests,” said Catherine Aubertin, research director at France's Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations.

With an average of 3.4 million barrels produced every day in 2024, Brazil is the world’s eighth-largest oil exporter. In 2024, crude oil became the country’s chief export, overtaking soybeans and making up 13.3 percent of Brazil’s total exports.

Speaking last year at COP29 in Azerbaijan – another major crude oil producer – Lula said he wanted to continue to increase Brazil’s oil exports to 36 percent by 2035.

There’s just one problem. According to projections, Brazil’s oil production will begin to decline from 2030 onwards as its current reserves are depleted. It’s a prognosis that has set off something of a panic in the upper ranks of the Brazilian government as well as the halls of Petrobas.

“The Equatorial Margin is the future of Brazil's energy sovereignty,” Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira wrote in a social media post. “We are ensuring that exploration is carried out with environmental responsibility, in accordance with the highest international standards, generating benefits for the Brazilian people.”

But climate scientists and activists agree that the time for looking for new oil reserves is over. Instead, they say, moving away from fossil fuels – the leading emitters of greenhouse gases – is crucial if humanity is to slow the world’s warming.

According to a Climate Observatory analysis, emissions released by Brazil’s energy sector are likely to rise from 490.6 million tonnes to 558 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050. It’s a far cry from the country’s ambitious promise to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 67 percent to 59 percent by the same year.

“It’s a contradiction that the Brazilian president is more or less owning up to,” Aubertin said. “He responds to it by repeating the same argument as other large oil producers: he supports the idea that oil revenue is used to finance the energy transition.”

“Is it contradictory? It is,” Lula conceded in a June 2024 interview with Brazilian radio CBN. “But as long as the energy transition isn’t solving our problem, Brazil needs to make money from this oil.”

Saving the forests

Aubertin stressed that Lula’s track record on climate change is more nuanced than the president’s oil ambitions make it seem.

“Even though Brazil is exporting its oil, it has still reached a very good level in terms of [the sustainability of] its internal energy consumption,” she said. “Eighty-nine percent of its electricity production comes from renewable energy.”

The Brazilian president has also undertaken a range of actions to make good on his climate commitments, Aubertin said. Since 2023, Lula has put in place a national energy transition policy with investment potential of up to €330 billion as well as ratifying a law creating a mandatory carbon market.

But his main victory in the fight to protect the environment has taken place on a different front: the fight against deforestation. Since coming to office, Lula has championed the struggle against illegal logging as one of the most critical goals of his presidency.

Read moreBrazil's Lula urges less talk, more action at COP30 climate meet

He brought back Marina Silva as environment minister, who had already managed to drastically lower the rate of deforestation during Lula’s first two terms (2003-2010). At the same time, the Brazilian president reactivated the Amazon Fund, an international financial mechanism designed to raise money in the fight against deforestation, strengthened regulations and stiffened penalties for illegal logging.

In just two years, the results have been spectacular. Although deforestation affected more than 10,000 square kilometres in 2022, the last year of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro’s term in office, Brazil’s deforestation had been halved by 2023 and continued to fall to close to 4,200 square kilometres in 2024. Outside of the nation’s massive rainforests, deforestation levels also fell in other vulnerable ecosystems such as the Cerrado, the biodiverse savanna south of the Amazon.

“Deforestation is mainly due to infrastructure construction and agricultural expansion, whether legal or illegal,” said Erin Matson, a consultant at Climate Focus and the author of a comprehensive report published in mid-October on the state of the world's forests.

“Brazil's excellent results show that simply strengthening controls can quickly and drastically reduce deforestation.”

“In the long term, curbing deforestation will only be possible through profound changes to our economic model, as pressure on forests continues to increase in line with global demand for soy, wood and paper,” she added. “But Brazil provides a very good example of how, when a head of state takes action, results can be achieved.”

A president ‘bound hand and foot’

“Lula acts with the leverage that he has,” Aubertin said. With Brazil's Congress dominated by conservatives keen on continued investment in petrol and representatives of agribusiness still carrying significant weight in the halls of power, “he is bound hand and foot and has to deal with a lot of pressures – sometimes contradictory ones”.

Perhaps because of this, Brazil’s agribusiness sector, which is responsible for 30.5 percent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, seems to have remained untouched by any environmental measures that would cut into its profit margins.

The industry managed to avoid the application of the carbon market law thanks to the support of the Parliamentary Agricultural Front, a powerful legislative bloc that often advocates for the agribusiness industry.

As COP30 begins, it remains to be seen just how Brazil's climate contradictions will be reflected in negotiations. True to form, the Brazilian president seems to have carefully sidestepped the awkward issue of fossil fuels for the moment.

Lula has already made it clear that protecting forests will take pride of place in COP30. He has said he hopes that one of the summit’s major advances will be the adoption of the Tropical Forest Forever Facilities, a new financial mechanism that would compensate countries for preserving their tropical forests – and which advocates say is as a much-needed weapon in the bitter fight against deforestation.",https://s.france24.com/media/display/2300fada-b0be-11f0-9029-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-64U36NP.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:02.137648

A policy paper for the clean energy jobs plan published this week includes the estimated demand – up from around 66,000 workers in the sector in 2023 – but noted challenges to scaling up the workforce.

“Previously, sector dependence on an uncertain pipeline of grant programmes and policy frameworks has created increased insecurity for businesses and job precarity,” read the paper.

It noted that consistent training was harder to achieve in a sector dominated by micro-enterprises, while a lack of data created difficulty in identifying skills gaps.

“There are also constraints in training provider capacity, including a lack of retrofit course availability and shortages of qualified tutors,” it continued.

The Government said these estimated figures may be revised under the £13.2bn Warm Homes Plan – expected later this year – which will address specific retrofit initiatives.

In the foreword to the report, energy secretary Ed Miliband said the Government has announced more than £50bn in clean energy investments since July 2024.

“This represents the biggest investment in homegrown clean energy in the UK’s history and is allowing us to take back control from petrostates and dictators and bring down bills for good,” he said.

Clean energy policies would also result in secure, well-paid work across the country, continued Miliband. This could triple jobs in the sector in Scotland and double them throughout the rest of the country, he said, supporting 856,000 jobs by 2030.

Noting that around 9,000 people underwent heat pump training in 2024, the policy paper outlined an action plan to scale up training opportunities.

This will involve phase one of the Warm Home Skills programme competition that is investing £8bn in grants to subsidise up to 9,000 trainees before July 2026, explained the paper.

An additional £5m for the Heat Training Grant will support the training of an additional 9,000 heat pump installers and heat network professionals during the current financial year.

The report recommends tips and policies to help more Americans adopt clean energy, even as federal tax credits phase out.

The analysis comes as Illinois legislators passed a bill to bolster clean energy projects and help meet the state’s climate goals.

“From Carbondale to Rockford, Illinoisans have invested their own time and money to install solar panels on their roofs, put EVs in their driveways, or buy clean energy from their utilities,” said Emily Kowalski, outreach and engagement manager with Environment Illinois Research and Policy Center. “Clean energy adoption in Illinois is a movement hiding in plain sight.”

The topline findings of the report show the breadth of public adoption of clean energy technologies across Illinois:

159,840 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are now registered in Illinois.

131,112 Illinois households have installed solar panels on their homes.

111,760 Illinoisans chose to purchase clean energy through their power supplier.

“This data shows that Americans are hungry for ways to reduce the use of dirty, dangerous and costly forms of energy in their daily lives. Elected leaders can make that easier by removing unnecessary barriers,” said Tony Dutzik, associate director and senior policy analyst for Frontier Group.

Illinois can help more residents adopt renewable energy by encouraging or requiring local jurisdictions to adopt instant permitting platforms for residential solar and energy storage systems, and ensure that utility rate structures do not disincentivize the adoption of energy-saving technologies.

Additionally, by establishing minimum energy efficiency standards for a variety of consumer and commercial appliances, Illinois could drastically cut climate emissions, energy waste and save consumers millions of dollars.

This is a fair question, but the sticker price of a car (and the lack of a government rebate) is only one piece of the total cost of vehicle ownership, which also includes fuel costs, maintenance and depreciation.

When you take that all into account, EVs are still usually cheaper to own in the long run, according to auto experts. We did the math to show you how the costs break down, and how you can make an accurate comparison before making your next car purchase.

Comparing the upfront costs of an EV, hybrid and gasoline car

The sticker price is what most people think about when they compare the prices of different cars. From that perspective, the disappearance of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit puts EVs at a significant disadvantage on upfront costs when compared to gasoline or passive-hybrid cars.

When it comes to upfront costs, we've mapped out the winner, loser and runner-up:

Comparing fuel and charging costs

This is where you start to see some of the biggest savings between EVs and gasoline vehicles. Here's how the costs shake out:

Maintenance and repair costs: Less is more

EVs are also a big winner for lower maintenance costs, which adds a nice bit of savings to their total cost of ownership. Here's how they compare to gasoline cars:

Comparing insurance costs

Insurance costs vary a lot depending on the type of car you own. Here are the general trends for different vehicles:

Depreciation and resale value: The wild card

Depreciation -- or how much your vehicle decreases in value over time -- can have a huge impact on your total cost of ownership. That's because when you go to sell your car, its residual value can make a big difference in how much money you lose in the transaction.

Here's the breakdown between gasoline and electric cars:

The verdict on total cost of ownership

I did the math with a real example, comparing an electric and gasoline-powered version of the same car: the new 2026 release of the Chevrolet Equinox.

Winner: Electric vehicles 🏆

Loser: Internal combustion engine vehicles 💸

Even without the federal government's $7,500 tax credit, EVs can still have a lower total cost of ownership than ICE cars.

""In general, you're going to be better off with an EV,"" Dalgaard says. That's because even though EVs have a higher upfront cost, gasoline cars can have more than double the fuel costs, and significantly higher maintenance costs.

Hybrids, meanwhile, probably have an advantage over ICE vehicles (due to the improved gas mileage), and offer a good middle ground if you're not ready for an EV.

Of course, the best choice for you is also going to depend on your driving habits: How much you drive, how long you plan to keep the car and whether you can charge an EV at home, for example.

The Public News Service Daily Newscast, November the 7th, 2025.

I'm Mike Clifford.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration Thursday to fund food stamps in full after admonishing the government for delaying aid under the nation's largest anti-hunger program during the shutdown.

That's the New York Times.

They report the Trump Justice Department almost immediately told the court that it would appeal the ruling.

The move renewed fears that the poorest Americans would not receive their full benefits to purchase groceries this month, leaving many at risk of imminent and severe financial hardship.

The order by the judge marked his second legal rebuke of the administration.

Meantime, New Mexico's largest city is expanding a program aimed at reducing violence by promoting peace, safety and community engagement.

Albuquerque is consistently ranked among U.S. cities with the highest crime rate.

To reverse the trend, the city has hosted Summer of Nonviolence campaigns the past two years featuring 20 events that attracted nearly 15,000 attendees including youth, adults and families.

City of Albuquerque Community Outreach Manager Jeffrey Bustamante says the program's success prompted a commitment to year-round activities.

We firmly believe that having fun, safe activities for our community is a violence prevention strategy and we love offering our parents the ability to send their kids home tired and full.

I'm Roz Brown.

Other cities that have introduced non-violence campaigns include Austin, Texas, Cincinnati, Ohio and Wilmington, Delaware.

And as violent encounters with federal immigration agents across Illinois continue to escalate, community organizers remain committed to ensuring everyone is armed with knowledge about their legal rights.

Federal officials report thousands have been arrested across the state since targeted immigrations and customs enforcement operations began in September.

The use of force by ICE agents has been legally challenged, but reports of physical encounters with both U.S. citizens and undocumented people are ongoing.

Ido Osagbovo with the Chicago Black Voter Project says she's hopeful collective lawful resistance will prevail.

It's common to assume that only folks of a certain demographic are impacted, but but Chicago's always been an interconnected city.

So we're talking about people who share space, whether that's living space or their kids go to school together.

She says her group has prioritized responding to community needs by hosting Know Your Rights training and through mutual aid hubs that offer donated food, clothing, and other essentials.

Corina Martinez with Cicero Family Services says the possibility of facing ICE is exacerbating legal issues in many communities, especially those that primarily speak Spanish.

She says they're also offering know your rights workshops, but in Spanish.

It turns out SNAP benefits aren't the only form of federal aid disrupted by the federal government shutdown.

Heating assistance for eligible households is at a standstill and a Minnesota coalition hopes the state steps in until the impact subsides.

The low-income Home Energy Assistance Program distributes federal dollars to states so they can sign up energy-burdened residents for utility bill relief and furnish repairs.

Minnesota's program recently announced this winter's lump sum is delayed due to the budget impasse but is still accepting applications.

Eighteen Minnesota-based organizations, including CURE, want the state to adopt short-term fixes.

CURE's Maggie Schubert says the timing is critical. are having issues paying for their energy costs generally, and that is being exacerbated by rising electricity prices and natural gas prices.

In a letter to Governor Tim Walz, the group's request to mandate that all Minnesota serving utilities halt shutoffs until LIHEAP funding resumes.

I'm Mike Moen.

Next up, the Affordable Care Act enrollment period has just begun.

Montanans are learning just how much their premiums could go up in 2026.

Expanded ACA tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.

Without them, some enrollees could see their premiums more than double.

That includes therapist, Anna Rolando, who has a private practice in Helena.

She expects her payments will rise by at least 100 percent without the enhanced tax credits, and she says it's unsustainable.

I think there's a lot of people that are either going to have to make the choice to not have health insurance coverage or to close their businesses.

And I just think it's really unfortunate.

More than 77,000 Montanans get their health insurance through Cover Montana, the state's ACA marketplace.

I'm Laura Hatch reporting.

Finally, clean energy supporters sailed to electoral victories across the country this week, including Virginia, and some consumer advocates believe that bodes well for the Commonwealth.

Former Democratic Congresswoman, Abigail Spanberger, decisively defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor, Winston Earl Sears on Tuesday race for governor.

All but a few localities in Virginia reported large swings towards Democrats compared to the 2024 election.

Democrats also won a commanding majority in the Virginia House of Delegates.

David Kiva with EDF Action says efforts to scale back clean energy expansions by the Trump administration have ended up hurting consumers.

He's been working as hard as he possibly can to snuff out investments in clean energy just because he doesn't like windmills or solar panels.

And that's hurting the American people and causing all of our bills to go up. and they said something about it really, really loudly on Tuesday night.

President Donald Trump has argued that increased use of fossil fuels and oil will create energy independence in the U.S.

He has previously blasted solar and wind energies as scams.

On The July 28, 2025 episode Economist Christian Briggs joins News Today to break down President Trump’s historic $2 trillion trade deal with Europe, calling it the most consequential agreement yet.

At the time of the episode’s release, the landmark accord outlined $750 billion in American energy exports paired with $600 billion in foreign investment directed toward U.S. infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean energy projects. Briggs explains how this framework is designed to stimulate domestic production, reduce European dependency on Russian energy, and generate sustainable employment across multiple industries.

“I think it's going to be a trillion dollar win”, said Briggs. “Not just from the selling of the product, but from the direct investments over the next 3 to 5 years.”

Briggs details how the policy could add over 200,000 new high-wage jobs through expanded LNG terminal construction, transportation upgrades, and advanced manufacturing initiatives. The episode also addresses macroeconomic outcomes, including projected GDP growth, supply chain resilience, and strengthened U.S. leverage in global energy markets.

The discussion highlights how the deal’s structure enhances American competitiveness while reinforcing strategic independence from adversarial energy suppliers. Briggs characterizes the move as a calculated economic and geopolitical masterstroke that will bolster U.S. industrial strength and long-term prosperity.

The partnership now includes Samsung SDI, marking a new phase in validation and production.

Solid Power’s large-format ASSB cells have now been integrated into a BMW i7 technology test vehicle, signalling further progress towards introducing the technology into evaluation vehicles for broader testing.

Developing solid-state battery technology

Solid Power is set to supply a sulphide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI, a material designed to replace the liquid electrolytes used in conventional lithium-ion batteries. The electrolyte helps enable solid-state batteries, which use solid materials instead of liquids to transport ions between electrodes during charging and discharging.

Samsung SDI will integrate the electrolyte it into the separator and/or catholyte. The resulting battery cells are then subject to technical performance evaluation under joint criteria set by Samsung SDI and BMW.

John Van Scoter, President and CEO at Solid Power, comments: “We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries. Our solid electrolyte technology is designed for stability and conductivity and, by working closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”

The aim is to prepare ASSB cells for integration into a next generation of BMW evaluation vehicles.

Targeting energy density and vehicle range

BMW says the partners believe in the potential of “genuine ASSB technology and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials"".

This shift could increase the energy density of batteries, which refers to the amount of energy stored per unit of volume or weight. A higher energy density may translate to extended range for electric vehicles without increasing the size or weight of the battery pack.

This view is echoed by Stella Joo-Young Go, Samsung SDI’s Executive Vice President of the ASSB Commercialisation Team: “Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately lead to innovation in electric vehicles. Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercialising ASSB.”

BMW’s battery development journey

BMW has worked with Solid Power since 2016 through a long-term Joint Development Agreement. This included a financial investment from BMW into Solid Power in 2021.

In 2022, BMW took the collaboration further by operating a prototype solid-state battery cell production line at its Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf, Germany. This setup is based on a R&D licence and leverages Solid Power’s manufacturing expertise.

BMW’s approach to battery technology extends back to 2008, when the company began developing its in-house capabilities in battery cell research. Since 2019, these efforts have been consolidated at the Battery Cell Competence Centre (BCCC) in Munich. The facility spans the full battery cell value chain, from design and development to manufacturability.

Martin Schuster, Vice President of Battery Cell and Cell Module at BMW Group, says: “With Samsung SDI joining our partnership with Solid Power, we gain significant momentum on our path advancing the development of new battery cell technologies. This global collaboration is another proof point of our overarching goal: to be always in a position to offer our customers state of the art battery technology.”

Through the BCCC, BMW gains access to innovative battery cell research across the globe. The auto giant states: “This strategically strong position in the value chain ensures the BMW Group access to all new and innovative battery cell research solutions worldwide.""

BMW now works with more than 300 partners, including Samsung SDI and Solid Power, as part of its ongoing investment in electric vehicle battery research and development. By strengthening partnerships with leaders in battery innovation, BMW positions itself to maintain a competitive edge in next-generation electric mobility.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/74de71522ff13c8699ad64f23dd1859d:2155a247e9d849f7075992b538df903c/bmw-i7-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:05:30.328979

“You don’t meet a challenge like climate change by standing still.","Keir Starmer escaped political trouble at home to take the stage at COP30 in Brazil, trying to convince world leaders that Britain is serious about climate action ten years after the Paris Agreement.

The Prime Minister said the global fight against climate change could not wait, warning that delay would only deepen the world’s economic and security risks.

“Can energy security wait too? Can bill-payers wait? Can we win the race for green jobs and investment by going slow?” he asked delegates. His answer was blunt: no.

Starmer said global unity on climate action had weakened and urged nations to rediscover their common purpose.

He spoke of the mounting dangers of floods, food price shocks and migration pressures driven by climate breakdown.

He used the summit to pitch Britain as a clean energy powerhouse, claiming his government was delivering “the largest investment of clean energy in British history and the biggest nuclear building programme in a generation.”

The Prime Minister highlighted new offshore wind farms from Yorkshire to Belfast, major battery sites in Greater Manchester and fresh investment in ports like Great Yarmouth. He said these projects form part of a £50 billion plan to create 800,000 clean energy jobs by 2030.

Starmer told delegates the UK would not cling to the old model of growth.

“You don’t meet a challenge like climate change by standing still. You do it by embracing change and doing it together,” he said.

He announced the relaunch of the Global Clean Power Alliance to unlock investment in developing countries and strengthen international supply chains.

He said the UK would share expertise and financing to speed up the global shift away from fossil fuels.

Starmer also promised that the transition at home would mean “cheaper bills, good jobs and long-term security” for working families, arguing that clean power is not a cost but “an immense opportunity to be seized.”

The message from COP30 was clear. The UK wants to prove it can lead again on climate after years of political drift.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. installed nearly 26 GW of new generation capacity between January and August 2025, up slightly from the approximately 23 GW installed over the same period last year, according to the most recent monthly infrastructure report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

As it has for most of the past two years, solar continued to dominate new generation resources, accounting for 2.7 GW out of 4 GW brought online in August alone, and 19 GW — about three-quarters — of generation capacity additions this year.

The report also says FERC reissued a certificate for Williams Companies to construct and operate its Northeast Supply Enhancement Project. That expansion of the Transco gas pipeline from New Jersey to New York was revived following talks between President Donald Trump and Gov. Kathy Hochul in May after the Trump administration briefly froze the Empire Wind project. The White House and the developer of the wind project have told journalists the two sides reached a gas-for-wind deal, while Hochul has denied striking such a bargain.

Dive Insight:

The report shows momentum for renewables continuing, despite the federal government’s emphasis on fossil fuels and nuclear. FERC lists 136 GW of “high probability additions” through August 2028, with renewables, led by solar and followed by wind, accounting for nearly 84%. Natural gas accounts for about 15% of high probability additions.

“Notwithstanding impediments created by the Trump Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, solar and wind continue to add more generating capacity than fossil fuels and nuclear power,” the Sun Day Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong said in a statement. “And FERC foresees renewable energy’s role expanding in the next three years while the shares provided by coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear all contract.”

Large renewable projects that began operating in August include Hecate Energy’s 517-MW Outpost solar and storage project in Webb County, Texas; Gibson Solar’s 280-MW project in Gibson County, Indiana; and expansions at the Roadrunner Crossing Wind Farm in Eastland County, Texas, totaling 254 MW.

While solar and wind made up most of the new generation added in August, a number of smaller gas generators also came online that month, totaling 888 MW. They include: Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Co’s 248-MW A.B. Brown expansion project in Posey County, Indiana; Basin Electric Power Coop’s 245-MW Pioneer Generation Station expansion in Williams County, North Dakota; and Lower Colorado River Authority’s 188-MW Maxwell Peaker Plant in Caldwell County, Texas.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fT8jCHJY2vc1CIavlSZYwb6Ntrr9NM4C9AJVy_hJqEI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UZXhhc193aW5kLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-07 11:07:09.888054

Menezes told investors if Air Products is able to adequately de-risk the project, it could add up economically.
The jeopardy comes as Air Products looks to cut its capital expenditure by over $1bn to $4bn in 2026 before getting to around $2.5bn by 2028.","Air Products believes it could still proceed with its paused $4.5bn blue hydrogen plant in Louisiana, US, according to its CEO.

Speaking during the industrial gas firm’s Q4 results, Eduardo Menezes said although the development would not go ahead without an offtake agreement, there may be a way to make the project bankable.

The Louisiana development was announced in 2021 with plans to produce up to 1,700 tonnes of blue hydrogen per day and convert it into ammonia.

Investors viewed the project as risky because of speculative offtake agreements and Air Products’ plan to retain responsibility for CCS and ammonia synthesis.

After Menezes became CEO earlier this year, Air Products paused spending on the development in May as it explored options to de-risk it by firming up offtake and looking to offload the CCS and ammonia operations.

Air Products is expected to make a decision to go ahead with the project before the end of 2025.

The CEO told investors the firm was looking to transform the project into a “regular” hydrogen and air separation project by handing off the CCS and ammonia elements.

“We’re evaluating proposals to divest the carbon sequestration and ammonia production assets,” he said. “We will only go forward with this project if we can sign firm offtake agreements for hydrogen and nitrogen from the facilities that will be owned and operated by Air Products.”

He indicated the firm was “very advanced” in those negotiations.

Menezes told investors if Air Products is able to adequately de-risk the project, it could add up economically.

“When you look at the natural gas price, the infrastructure that we have in place, and the 45Q [carbon capture incentive], it is the right place to install blue ammonia projects,” he said.

“Even our competitors that are doing similar projects in Texas and Louisiana and saying exactly the same thing: that you can be competitive even against grey ammonia in Europe.”

“If I really didn’t think we have a chance to have something, it would be much easier for me to say that today. But we still believe we can find an interesting solution for this project.”

However, if a solution can’t be found, Air Products would look to minimise its losses.

“If we decided not to go forward, of course, we still have this asset that is the floor space that we can try to monetise in the market,” Menezes said.

The jeopardy comes as Air Products looks to cut its capital expenditure by over $1bn to $4bn in 2026 before getting to around $2.5bn by 2028.

The decision will play a key role in how the company balances growth in low-carbon hydrogen with tighter capital spending targets.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/01/Image-courtesy-of-Air-Products-and-Chemicals-Inc-Air-Products-SMR-Convent-Louisiana-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-11-07 11:09:10.544195

Are you thinking about buying an electric vehicle?","Tesla has listed 30 new jobs at its Austin location in anticipation of a ramped-up production process for its buzzworthy self-driving taxi.

As reported by the Austin American-Statesman, the electric vehicle manufacturer is currently hiring for roles at Gigafactory Texas to begin Cybercab production, with ""volume production"" potentially starting in 2026.

Most of the new roles are directly related to manufacturing and include engineering and equipment technicians for areas such as the drive units, battery packs, and general assembly. These new listings indicate the company is rapidly accelerating its hiring efforts ahead of the large-scale rollout of the Cybercab.

As noted by the Statesman, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously alluded to the fact that the Cybercab will become the company's ""highest-volume vehicle"" yet, with a target of producing around two million units annually. Musk has stated that its manufacturing process will be significantly different from traditional car lines, resembling a high-speed consumer electronics assembly.

While the promising production speed is tantalizing, Musk has made several promises about various Tesla vehicles that have come up short, including the production of the Cybertruck. The EV manufacturer created a post-launch goal of 200,000 to 250,000 units per year, based on the original high demand for the electric truck.

However, since its launch in 2023, the Cybertruck has failed to live up to expectations, posting disappointing sales numbers over the last two years. This has matched with the company's overall sales struggles in the EV marketplace, especially across several countries in Europe, where Tesla is being outpaced by rival manufacturers.

Although the Cybertruck has failed to live up to the hype, Tesla has certainly sparked widespread interest in EVs. More people than ever are making the switch from gas-powered vehicles and taking advantage of the fewer maintenance requirements of EVs and their long-term value.

Drivers can increase their savings even more by opting to charge their EV at home. Home charging stations are significantly cheaper than using public chargers, offering hundreds of dollars in annual savings. Qmerit is helping homeowners who are interested in installing Level 2 EV chargers by providing free, instant installation estimates.

EV drivers can take those savings to another level when pairing their home charging station with the installation of solar panels. Charging your EV with your own energy is cheaper than using public charging stations and can be more dependable than relying on the grid. EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

The construction of data centers, power plants, transmission lines, pipelines and other kinds of energy infrastructure could be a game changer for the U.S. economy, and especially rural America.
Despite several attempts at reform, America’s permitting system for major construction projects is still woefully inefficient.
It’s even been weaponized by fringe activist groups to block commonsense infrastructure projects that would be permitted in a heartbeat by other countries.
Without these projects, our nation is staring down the barrel of a less reliable energy system and more expensive energy.","After decades of stagnant growth, the demand for energy in America is surging again.

A major driver is the return of manufacturing, after decades of offshoring, thanks to President Trump negotiating new trade and investment deals with other countries. An even bigger reason is America’s determination to win the global race for dominance in artificial intelligence (AI).

The rise of AI and the growing use of cloud computing by businesses and individuals is fueling a boom in data center construction across the country. In the short term, all those new data centers will need a staggering amount of electricity to power their operations — roughly 150-400 terawatt hours per year by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

In practical terms, that could mean building more new power plants than currently exist in California, Oregon and Washington state in the space of just a few years.

The construction of data centers, power plants, transmission lines, pipelines and other kinds of energy infrastructure could be a game changer for the U.S. economy, and especially rural America.

But none of it — none — can happen without every individual project and piece of infrastructure getting a federal permit of some kind.

And there we have a problem. Despite several attempts at reform, America’s permitting system for major construction projects is still woefully inefficient. It’s even been weaponized by fringe activist groups to block commonsense infrastructure projects that would be permitted in a heartbeat by other countries.

There are many cases where permitting reviews that could be completed in months but are taking years instead, and it’s destroying our ability to stay ahead of countries like China. Just look at the 15 years it took to permit the 700-mile TransWest transmission line. The madness has to stop.

This is why the work of Republican Congressman Gabe Evans of Colorado, a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives, deserves to be highlighted.

Congressman Evans worked with three other members of the caucus from California, Pennsylvania and New York to develop a series of reforms to the U.S. permitting system that are badly overdue.

Some highlights of the Evans framework for permitting reform include:

• Speed up permitting through clear and enforceable deadlines for agency decisions and court challenges.

• Replace outdated paper systems with centralized digital platforms and online portals, which will reduce delays and increase public transparency.

• Eliminate duplicative environmental reviews and court challenges for pipeline and transmission line projects that ask and answer the same questions over and over.

• Take politics out of cross-border infrastructure projects — like the Keystone XL pipeline, which was killed by former president Joe Biden on his first day in office — by removing the White House from the formal approval process.

The framework isn’t about reducing environmental safeguards — it’s about giving those safeguards a chance to actually work by allowing well-designed and environmentally responsible projects to enter construction.

“We have to make sure that we can navigate our own regulatory environment to be able to build these things here in the United States with some of the best and most environmentally and socially responsible guidelines, really anywhere on the planet,” Congressman Evans told Colorado Public Radio.

The new reality of American energy demand will require every energy technology we can muster, including solar, battery storage, natural gas turbines, geothermal, wind and nuclear — and the reforms being pushed by Congressman Evans and his bipartisan allies will help all of those energy sources move through the permitting process faster.

Without these projects, our nation is staring down the barrel of a less reliable energy system and more expensive energy. That’s bad enough on its own, but failure to build will also hand victory in the global AI race to China, which is notorious for building things fast with few, if any, safeguards.

Like it or not, whichever nation wins the AI race will have the best weapons and control the flow of information in an increasingly digital world. Losing is not an option, and as a country, it’s time we started acting like it.

A demand air pocket

Rivian's quarterly strength was helped by U.S. buyers rushing to capture federal EV tax credits before they expired on Sept. 30. In other words, there was a significant pull-forward in demand. To this end, management expects a huge step down in deliveries for the final quarter of the year; the mid-point of the company's full-year vehicle delivery guidance range implies about 10,000 deliveries in Q4, down from just over 13,200 in Q3 and about even with the year-ago period -- not the sort of growth profile you want from a company operating with massive losses.

So, is the stock's big gain the beginning of a longer-term upward move? While there's no way to know what a stock will do in the future, I personally wouldn't bet on good returns from here. The stock's nearly $19 billion market cap, even as Rivian burns through cash, just isn't a compelling investment thesis. Indeed, given the capital intensity of its business, it wouldn't be surprising to see losses accelerate as production of a lower-priced model ramps up next year.

With all of this said, I would consider changing my mind if sales growth begins accelerating on a more consistent basis next year. But I'd need to see signs of significant improvement in profitability, too. Additionally, I might consider the stock if it were cheaper; to convince me to invest in a risky, capital-intensive operation, I'm going to need a really good deal.

In the statement, the company noted that its inaugural EMPower Network Program will see former veterans undertake 12-months of formal training, accredited qualifications, rotational placements, and mentoring from experienced professionals.
In the statement, Nicola Connelly, CEO of SP Energy Networks, said, “we’re proud to welcome the first cohort of veterans to the EMPower Network Program”.

In the statement, the company noted that its inaugural EMPower Network Program will see former veterans undertake 12-months of formal training, accredited qualifications, rotational placements, and mentoring from experienced professionals.

“Participants will gain hands-on experience across the business, developing the technical and leadership skills needed to thrive in one of the UK’s most critical industries,” ScottishPower said in the statement.

EMPower joins a suite of pre-employment programs offered by ScottishPower, including initiatives for young people, career returners, and graduates, the company highlighted in the statement, adding that, “together, these programs form a cornerstone of the company’s approach to inclusive recruitment and long-term talent development”.

ScottishPower said in the statement that the launch of the EMPower Network Program “marks a major milestone” in its “broader strategy to invest in people and skills as the energy system undergoes its most significant transformation in decades”.

The company revealed in the statement that it is “recruiting at a record rate as it builds its workforce to deliver the biggest rewiring Britain has seen”. ScottishPower said it will create 300 jobs by the end of the year alone and another 2,000 jobs by 2027.

Veterans joining EMPower will be based across Central and Southern Scotland, North West England, and Mid/North Wales, with roles tailored to their aspirations and strengths, ScottishPower said in the statement.

“Research shows that over 80 percent of former military personnel believe their skills are transferable to civilian roles, yet many report struggling to find long-term employment or to maintain confidence in their capabilities,” ScottishPower noted in the statement.

“EMPower aims to bridge this gap by giving veterans the tools, knowledge and confidence to take on roles in one of the UK’s most critical industries,” it added.

“With the energy sector undergoing rapid transformation to meet electrification, the initiative is a key step in future-proofing the grid and building a more diverse, resilient workforce,” it continued.

In the statement, Nicola Connelly, CEO of SP Energy Networks, said, “we’re proud to welcome the first cohort of veterans to the EMPower Network Program”.

“This is a significant moment - not just for those starting their journey with us, but for the energy sector as a whole,” Connelly added.

“Veterans bring resilience, adaptability and leadership, and the EMPower Network Program is about recognizing that value and giving them the opportunity to build meaningful careers while helping us deliver the infrastructure Britain needs,” Connelly continued.

UK Minister for Veterans and People, Louise Sandher-Jones, said in the statement, “the EMPower Network Program provides a clear pathway for veterans to transition these skills into meaningful careers in one of our most critical industries - helping them to maximize their potential whilst contributing to our Plan for Change to make Britain a clean energy superpower”.

“Programs like this and the government-funded Career Transition Partnership and Op ASCEND employment support service will help ensure no veteran falls through the cracks, and that the energy sector benefits from the outstanding talent our Armed Forces community has to offer,” the minister added.

UK Minister for Industry Chris McDonald said in the statement, “having employed veterans myself, I know that they already have the expertise to take advantage of the thousands of well-paid clean energy jobs that are being created across the country by our clean energy superpower mission - including upgrading Britain’s electricity grid”.

Ex-serviceman Barry McIntosh went on to note in the statement, “I’m excited to begin this new chapter with the EMPower Network Program”.

“Joining SP Energy Networks means more than a job - it means being part of something that powers communities and drives our green future forward,” he added.

“The same commitment, teamwork and resilience I learned in the forces will now help me support Scotland’s energy transition and build something lasting. This isn’t just a change of uniform - it’s a new purpose, a new mission, and I’m ready for it,” he continued.

In a statement posted on its website back in September, ScottishPower said it welcomed its largest ever cohort of early career professionals.

“A record 338 graduates and trainees have joined the company this month, kicking off their careers in roles that span engineering, cyber security, project management and more,” ScottishPower said in that statement.

“It’s the largest early careers intake ScottishPower has ever welcomed - and it includes a 59 percent jump in apprentices and a 47 percent rise in graduate hires compared to last year,” it added.

“The company has significantly ramped up its investment in talent, reflecting the growing demand for skilled professionals across its businesses signaling the company’s commitment to building the workforce of the future,” it continued.

The two-year graduate program and hands-on trainee schemes are designed to fast-track careers while giving participants the chance to work on major infrastructure and energy projects across the UK, ScottishPower noted in that statement.

ScottishPower is part of the Iberdrola Group, which the statement describes as one of the world’s largest integrated utility companies and a global leader in electrification. ScottishPower noted in the statement that it is “the only vertically integrated energy company in the UK with businesses that operate from power to plug”.",,N,,2025-11-07 11:05:51.355840

So much so that he applied to West Point for college and got in.
The mix of his West Point peers and high school friends sparked lively — and sometimes tense — conversations.
Today, as a professor at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, McElroy studies how affective polarization — the growing dislike and distrust of people with different political views — affects the workplace.
Especially since nearly 75% of employees are having politically charged conversations in the workplace, according to McElroy.","The summer before his senior year of high school, Terence McElroy found himself in an unexpected place: a leadership camp at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He was there to prepare for his new role as captain of the cross-country team.

“It was a place I never could have imagined myself,” he admits.

Despite growing up just 60 miles south of West Point, McElroy had few connections to the military. But something about the structure, the discipline, and the drive of those around him — people striving to be their best mentally, physically, and academically — resonated deeply. So much so that he applied to West Point for college and got in.

That first summer of training, though, was a shock.

“I was not a very good cadet at first,” he says, chuckling. “But I adapted, and by the end of freshman year, I loved it.”

With his family just 45 minutes away, McElroy often brought fellow cadets home during school breaks. The mix of his West Point peers and high school friends sparked lively — and sometimes tense — conversations.

“There would always be tension and conflict,” he says. “When you’re 21 years old and having all these late-night discussions about life, politics inevitably came up. I always found myself as more of a peacemaker, seeing the good points made by both sides.”

Those moments stuck with him. Today, as a professor at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, McElroy studies how affective polarization — the growing dislike and distrust of people with different political views — affects the workplace. He also explores how multicultural experiences shape leadership.

“I think a lot of the lessons I learned in the military translate nicely into the business world,” he says.

From the Army to academia

After graduating from West Point in 2010, McElroy became a field artillery officer and completed airborne school at Fort Benning, Georgia. Then, he became a U.S. Army Ranger, completing tours in Afghanistan and Italy.

“Being 23 years old and leading soldiers — many of whom were older than me — was a huge challenge and a very humbling experience,” McElroy shares. “You’re leading people from all walks of life, and I quickly realized that I couldn’t communicate with everyone the same way.”

Eager to improve his leadership skills, McElroy enrolled in an MBA program at the University of Virginia after completing his service in 2016.

“It was really my MBA experiences that shaped my interest in pursuing topics related to our cultural differences and figuring out moments where we could bridge divides,” he says.

One professor recommended he read “The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion” by Jonathan Haidt. The book, which explores moral foundations theory — a framework co-developed by Haidt to explain the psychology of morality — struck a chord.

Inspired, McElroy decided to pursue a PhD focused on political ideology in the workplace. At the time, few business schools were exploring the topic, and he wasn’t sure it was the right path.

Then, fate intervened.

He saw Haidt on a train in New York City. The renowned social psychologist encouraged McElroy to pursue the research — and even offered to help with his PhD applications.

“I was blown away by his generosity,” McElroy says. “He reviewed my materials and encouraged me to pursue my interests during a time I was unsure I could even talk about politics at a business school. Without that, I don’t know if I’d be where I am.”

Culture, conflict, and connection

McElroy was drawn to Kenan-Flagler’s PhD program by faculty like William Maddux, whose research delves into how cultural experiences shape creativity, leadership, morality, and decision-making in the workplace. Their shared interests made Maddux a natural fit as McElroy’s advisor.

McElroy focuses his research on countering affective polarization — the tendency to view those with opposing political beliefs as fundamentally different or threatening. He argues that this misperception is fueled by extreme views amplified through social media, partisan news outlets, and political rhetoric.

His findings suggest that multicultural experiences such as studying abroad often lead to more open-minded perspectives, a deeper understanding of personal identity, and a greater ability to form meaningful connections with others.

“When people go abroad, they’re immersed in a new culture, surrounded by a different language, and forced to adapt,” McElroy says. “They’re outside their comfort zones. Many return as better leaders because they’ve faced challenges and succeeded. It changes people.”

McElroy also suggests that embracing contradictory beliefs — rather than trying to change someone’s mind — may be a powerful strategy for reducing polarization and cultivating empathy across ideological lines. Especially since nearly 75% of employees are having politically charged conversations in the workplace, according to McElroy.

“We know these conversations are happening,” he says. “We want to provide managers with a framework to foster a culture where people feel safe expressing differing views.”

One practical approach? Teaching leaders to be listeners. McElroy sees the impact firsthand with his executive MBA students. In one coaching session, students bring in real leadership challenges they’re facing.

“There’s often a lightbulb moment,” he says. “We focus on truly understanding the problem, actively listening — and they start solving it themselves just by talking through it.”

He believes this same approach can transform political conversations. When people listen with the intent to understand rather than debate, they’re better positioned to resolve conflict and build trust.

“I’d love to live in a world where we could talk about our experiences and our beliefs from a place of curiosity,” he says. “That’s the direction I hope my research continues to explore.”",https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/terence-mcelroy-lead.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:08:53.341755

Despite the challenges of running a business, Sonnenberg finds joy in the human connection it allows.","DETROIT LAKES — At 15-years-old, Emily Sonnenberg opened Ideal Thrifts . Since, it has become her full-time job. In addition to providing the lakes area resident with a career, it has also kept vintage clothes in circulation.

It was January 2021 when Sonnenberg began selling clothes online. Growing up around the area, the rural Frazee resident shopped second-hand for affordability, often thrifting for clothes and getting everyday items from garage sales. She became aware of how others were selling their finds online and it sparked an entrepreneurial interest in her. From her childhood bedroom, she opened her online clothing store.

Since the inception of her business, Sonnenberg has found high-quality, vintage items second-hand and then rehomes them.

“I saw other people making an income doing this thing that I already do and I love, so I thought, ‘Why don’t I pick up things for other people to rehome?’” she said. “Growing up, we shopped second-hand just because it's more affordable, but as my passion for it grew, you kind of get addicted to rehoming these pieces.”

Her business began with Instagram story sales, regularly posting products as part of “Story Sale Sundays.” Now, at 20 years old, over the last four years, she has expanded to Poshmark , eBay and Whatnot , a live-selling platform.

This past summer, she participated in the most in-person markets she has ever done, including booths at WE Fest and Shady Hallow Flea Market. She even hired her first-ever part-time assistant, Clodarl Seeman of Perham, who she met when Seeman was a customer of hers.

“That’s where my passion lies, in the human interaction, connecting with people in person,” she said.

The transition back to school after COVID was difficult, she said. She ran the business throughout high school and graduated from an online program. She also attended college-level courses online and secured an entrepreneurship certificate from M State. Sonnenberg said the decision to go to school online allowed her to focus on running her business while keeping up academically.

“I’ve always been someone who can keep myself accountable for my work,” she said.

Reclaiming a love of thrifting by making an income isn’t what drives Sonnenberg. She aims to reduce the amount of clothing that ends up in landfills and counteract a culture of consumerism. She wants to be conscious of the environmental impacts of the fashion industry.

“I think that's just important to a lot of our generation,” she said, adding that second-hand fashion is more ethical and sustainable. “It’s not just creating, and creating and creating… a lot of big corporations do not have ethical procedures in place.”

Social media also helped her learn more about the fashion industry’s hidden consequences, and she encourages people to educate themselves.

“I learned through other people the problems that not everybody talks about — we’re not always conscious of how the fashion industry, the new fashion industry, is harmful,” she said.

Sonnenberg encourages people to think critically about consumption. She said that she focuses on high-quality materials and natural fibers whenever possible.

“They’re quality, but they can also decompose, so like, if something happens, they're recyclable, unlike polyester elastic,” she said.

Fast fashion, defined as trendy, inexpensive clothing designed for short-term wear, has significant environmental impacts. The fashion industry contributes 2-8% of global greenhouse gas emissions . By rehoming clothing, Sonnenberg reduces the demand for new production, which lowers consumption, emissions and textile waste. Conscious purchasing and brand research are ways consumers can mitigate these impacts.

The biggest growth, Sonnenberg said, came from diversifying sales platforms, but she also has plenty more ideas for the future.

“Because we're partially in person and partially online, it can look so many different ways. And I'm only 20, and I'm not sure how I want it to look, but I'm always gonna toy with the idea of having a brick and mortar,” she said. She hopes to expand her team next summer and collaborate with other small businesses, especially women.

Despite the challenges of running a business, Sonnenberg finds joy in the human connection it allows. She loves seeing customers light up when they find something they’ve been looking for. For her, the curation process is a form of creative expression.

“Everything that running your own business encompasses, I don't want to take away the creative aspect of it. I don't create my products, but it's a curation … when people find things through me, it's an expression because it's unique — they see themselves in it,” she said.

Sonnenberg has a particular passion for 1990s vintage fashion. She prefers sourcing originals over reproductions, noting that many modern brands, including Urban Outfitters and Brandy Melville, take inspiration from previous decades.

Ensuring cuts in emissions can completely transform the climate crisis that the world is being subjected to. Now, it has emerged that the DNV, a global independent assurance and risk management provider, has noted that the renewable energy sector will account for over 25% of emission reduction levels in the Asia-Pacific region, with hydrogen, ammonia, and emerging fuels playing a critical role.

New Energy Commodities (NEC) will be essential to reducing emissions in APAC

DNV has become a global leader in the analysis of the emission goals of the world. The Asia-Pacific region, known most of the time as APAC, will see its New Energy Commodities playing a crucial role in cutting emissions in the region, with hydrogen, ammonia, and emerging fuels playing a major role in reaching APAC’s emission goals by 2050.

According to a new report from DNV, NECs will account for roughly 25% of APAC’s emission reduction over the next decade or so, as the sector has seen significant growth in the region and further afield over the past few years. Reducing emissions will allow the planet to recover from generations of abuse from the fossil fuel sector, with NECs playing an essential role in APAC specifically, as noted by DNV’s leadership.

““Reaching net zero won’t be possible without NECs, especially in Asia-Pacific where diverse solutions are needed due to the region’s geography. Hydrogen, ammonia, sustainable fuels, and carbon capture are essential for industries that are hard to decarbonize. Without expanding NECs, these sectors risk falling behind. – Brice Le Gallo, Vice-President and Regional Director, Asia Pacific, Energy Systems at DNV

DNV published its report at a recent renewable energy summit in Singapore

During the recent Asia Clean Energy Summit (ACES), held in conjunction with Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2025, DNV released its report titled The role of new energy commodities in decarbonizing Asia Pacific. The report finds that NECs will account for approximately 25% of APAC’s emission cuts over the next few decades as the world turns to the renewable energy sector.

Furthermore, the report finds that several APAC nations will see increases in NEC consumption, with Japan, South Korea, and Singapore expected to become top consumers of the NEC sector, although it should be noted that they will mostly rely on foreign imports. Certifying low-carbon energy is the name of the game for DNV. Europe has also seen its Parliament approve a new framework for low-carbon hydrogen certification, pointing to the role that hydrogen will play in the global energy sector over the next few decades.

DNV’s management has noted the importance of decarbonizing several sectors in APAC, with the organization’s leadership lamenting the slow adoption of the NEC sector.

“Within the region’s diverse range of countries, six key industries (aviation, maritime, steel, power, industrial chemicals and cement) will depend heavily on NECs to achieve deep decarbonization.” – Thomas Koller, Regional Hydrogen, Ammonia and Sustainable Fuels Lead, Asia Pacific, Energy Systems at DNV

According to the USGS’ report on silicon, there are currently four companies that produce polysilicon in the US.
In the case of tellurium and its use in CdTe thin-film solar technology, First Solar is the most well-known company using this technology.
In the case of silicon, most of the solar manufacturing capacity across the entire supply chain is still concentrated in China, especially at the wafer level.
The addition of silicon and the continued inclusion of tellurium have been welcomed by trade body the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, which had called for the inclusion of silicon and maintaining tellurium in the list last September.","Silicon is the foundation mineral for most current solar technologies and is used to produce polysilicon, which is then used to produce silicon wafers. According to the USGS’ report on silicon, there are currently four companies that produce polysilicon in the US.

In that report summary, several examples of companies building a silicon-based solar supply chain are highlighted without naming any companies, however some of the examples can clearly be referenced to Qcells—with mention of its vertically-integrated facility in Georgia—and REC Silicon, with the mention of production of its electronic-grade polysilicon ceasing in Montana.

Moreover, the summary, which can be accessed here, highlights that nearly 80% of the global estimated production of silicon materials—not just for solar products—in 2024 came from Chima.

In the case of tellurium and its use in CdTe thin-film solar technology, First Solar is the most well-known company using this technology. The company recently unveiled plans to build another manufacturing facility in the US next year, which will have an annual nameplate capacity of 3.7GW, once it reaches full capacity in the first half of 2027.

The USGS’ list of critical minerals help determine which minerals are considered essential for the economy of the US, its national security and if its supply chains can be vulnerable to any disruption. In the case of silicon, most of the solar manufacturing capacity across the entire supply chain is still concentrated in China, especially at the wafer level.

The addition of silicon and the continued inclusion of tellurium have been welcomed by trade body the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, which had called for the inclusion of silicon and maintaining tellurium in the list last September.

“The US leads the world in CdTe innovation and manufacturing, and this continued recognition will help strengthen domestic supply chains for tellurium refining and recovery, supporting growth of American solar manufacturing and innovation,” said Mike Carr, executive director at the SEMA Coalition.

The addition of silicon to the list comes only days after the US solar industry celebrated the reshoring of the entire supply chain with Corning’s ingot and wafer plant beginning operations in the third quarter of 2025.

“Together, these inclusions signal the administration’s recognition that energy security depends on the strength and resilience of the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished solar modules. We look forward to working to ensure these critical designations translate into meaningful policy tools that derisk supply chains, create American jobs, and bolster American energy dominance,” added Carr.

However, solar manufacturing using silicon remains scarce in the US, with insufficient polysilicon and wafer manufacturing annual nameplate capacity to meet current market demand, which is expected to be less than 50GW in 2025, according to recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20071029151252_08_Polysilicon_solar_cell.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:04:21.784009

EVs accounted for about 8% of U.S. vehicle sales in 2024, up from just 1.9% five years earlier.","The nation’s charging network is expanding faster than ever, yet many Americans still fear running out of power before finding a plug. New federal data show that nearly 70% of the mileage on the ten longest U.S. interstates now lies within 10 miles of a fast electric vehicle charger.

Expanding access, lingering doubts

According to an analysis by the Associated Press using data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, more than 12,000 new fast-charging ports have been installed within a mile of U.S. highways this year alone—about one-fifth of all quick chargers currently in service.

Despite that growth, range anxiety remains widespread. A new AP-NORC and University of Chicago survey found that four in ten adults still cite charging access or range as a major reason not to buy an electric vehicle. Only about two in ten say they are very likely to choose an EV as their next car.

Advocates like Daphne Dixon, who leads a nonprofit promoting clean transportation, are working to change those perceptions. Dixon has driven cross-country in an EV every year since 2022, documenting her experience online in hopes of showing that charging infrastructure is already strong enough for long trips.

“Range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” she said. “A lot of people still fear there aren’t enough chargers, but new ones are being put in every single day.”

Charging the interstates

Drivers on Interstate 80, which stretches from New York to California, now find few segments farther than 10 miles from a fast charger between New York City and Des Moines, Iowa. Out west, coverage remains patchier, but it has improved sharply—up 44% since 2021.

Nationwide, nearly 70% of the ten longest interstates are now within 10 miles of a high-speed charger, up from about half five years ago. These stations can recharge a depleted EV battery in 20 minutes to an hour, compared to four to ten hours for slower home chargers.

Even so, some rural regions still lack access. In Connecticut, for example, the only charger along part of scenic Route 7 had been out of service for years. Local officials say new federal funding—about $1.3 million—will add eight fast plugs nearby in 2026 after delays in the national EV infrastructure rollout.

Cost still the biggest barrier

While many drivers worry about charging, cost remains the leading obstacle. The same poll found that high sticker prices are the top reason Americans hesitate to switch to electric cars. Only about 20% said price was not a factor.

EVs accounted for about 8% of U.S. vehicle sales in 2024, up from just 1.9% five years earlier. Analysts note that long-term ownership costs are lower because electricity and maintenance are cheaper than gasoline, but consumers often focus on the upfront expense—especially as federal tax credits have expired, adding $7,500 to the effective price of many new models.

A gradual shift

Advocates say daily driving habits make modern EVs practical for most people. The average American drives less than 30 miles per day, well within the range of even lower-cost models.

Connecticut driver Jim Warner, who owns both an EV and a plug-in hybrid, said he has driven his Chevy Bolt about 400 miles on road trips without problems. “The first trip, I turned the heat off and stayed at 65,” he said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

As the network of chargers continues to grow, experts say the biggest challenge may no longer be infrastructure—but convincing drivers that it’s already there.

Ben Shire, director of civic partnerships at West Central Initiative, told the Moorhead Economic Development Authority that West Central is celebrating 40 years serving a nine-county region and a portion of the White Earth Nation.

""I think it's more than $13,000,000, which has come back into the city limits of Morehead since we started back in 1986,"" Shire said, describing grant and discretionary funds awarded to Moorhead organizations.

Shire highlighted a ""mayor's network"" of 10 communities installing small-scale solar on public buildings in partnership with Otter Tail Power Company and using federal tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act. He said those are typically ""40 kW or less"" projects that often cash-flow within two years and can produce decades of taxpayer savings.

Shire said the Minnesota Department of Commerce indicated it may free up state funds to leverage federal rebates to reach communities that are served by municipal utilities and are currently ineligible for some private utility rebates; Moorhead was cited as an example. ""We're having a follow-up call with them this week,"" he said.

Why it matters: The presentation underscored regional partnership models for economic and clean-energy work and asked the EDA to consider continuing Moorhead's funding support for West Central Initiative in upcoming city budgets.

Addition of uranium to the U.S. Geological Survey Critical Minerals List marks a major step toward revitalizing U.S. uranium mining and rebuilding America's nuclear fuel supply chain

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE American: UEC), the ""Company"" or ""UEC"") applauds the U.S. Government decision to add uranium in the U.S. Geological Survey's (""USGS"") Final 2025 Critical Minerals List, as published in the Federal Register, recognizing its essential role in America's energy and national security.

Amir Adnani, President and CEO, stated:

""We applaud the U.S. Government, particularly Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the U.S. Geological Survey, for taking this important step toward fulfilling President Trump's vision of restoring America's leadership in critical minerals and achieving true U.S. Energy Dominance. UEC is heeding that call with ramp-up and development activities at our three licensed hub-and-spoke production platforms in Texas and Wyoming. In parallel, we're advancing the United States Uranium Refining & Conversion Corp. to help restore and expand America's domestic nuclear fuel conversion capabilities.""

The Energy Act of 2020 allows the Secretary of the Interior to designate a mineral as critical when another federal agency, such as the Department of Energy or another relevant agency, determines it is strategic and critical to U.S. defense or national security. The Department of Energy recommended uranium's inclusion, citing its importance in energy production and defense applications, and the Department of Defense also emphasized its national security significance.

The Federal Register Notice states:

""Critical minerals are essential for national security, economic stability, and supply chain resilience because they underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy. The United States is heavily reliant on imports of certain mineral commodities from foreign sources, some of which are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain disruptions. The United States' dependence on imports and the vulnerability of supply chains raise the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience. The Nation possesses vast mineral resources that can create jobs, fuel prosperity, and significantly reduce our reliance on foreign nations, and the United States is taking actions to facilitate domestic mineral production. The List of Critical Minerals guides strategies to secure the Nation's mineral supply chains.""

Some states have taken action to aid and encourage clean energy development in their states.

For wind and solar energy facilities to qualify for the tech-neutral Internal Revenue Code Section 45Y production tax credit (PTC) and Section 48E investment tax credit (ITC), construction must begin by July 4, 2026, or they must be placed in service no later than Dec. 31, 2027. For facilities that begin construction or place in service by the deadline, they can claim 100% of the credit until 2033.

The states that stood to lose the most from the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act included Texas, Florida, Indiana, South Carolina and Illinois, according to June analysis by Cleanview Newsletter, a blog by a software platform that tracks clean energy data.

Julia Dinkel, associate director of public policy with Novogradac, said how much initiatives states take is often at the discretion of the political will within each state–and in its statehouse, with so-called “blue states” seemingly more amenable to accelerating green and clean energy endeavors than “red states.”

“It will largely depend on the governor,” said Dinkel. “Certainly, some Grand Old Party (GOP) governors are supportive of renewables.” They could be receptive to executive initiatives and, if bills to facilitate deployment were to come to their desk, they might be more receptive to signing them, said Dinkel.

The red/blue divide has layers. When President Donald Trump’s administration announced in early October it would terminate $7.56 billion in financial awards to more than 321 green and clean energy facilities, the impact weighed more heavily on blue states.

The U.S. Department of Energy also announced in September that it would “return more than $13 billion in unobligated funds” authorized in the IRA for clean energy endeavors.

Despite the changes, solar and wind facilities have seen the hardest push in the aftermath of OBBBA’s passage, said Dinkel.

“As we go along, I expect to see another push from states to adapt to the actual end of the credits,” said Dinkel.

Beyond state legislatures are utilities and regional organizations, said Dinkel. Three of the nation’s seven major regional transmission organizations developed and implemented or were in the process of implementing fast-tracking plans for energy resources as of September, including the country’s largest,

PJM Interconnection.

The pressure to place in service before the end of 2027 is clogging already-packed interconnection queues, said Dinkel.

“It’s a major hurdle everyone is, rightly, freaking out about,” said Dinkel, noting that solar and storage facilities make up the bulk of facilities waiting for interconnection.

At least four states–Colorado, California, Maine and New York–have already taken steps to accelerate the production of renewable energy facilities.

Colorado

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a letter in August directing state agencies to prioritize renewable energy facilities, including calling for the state to “integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible, along with any necessary electricity balancing resources and supporting infrastructure.” Polis asked all relevant agencies in the Centennial State to prioritize expeditious review of new facilities, calling out those eligible for Section 45, Section 48 and Section 25D specifically, as well as requesting consultation, permitting and pursuing flexible interconnection.

“We must provide confidence to the clean energy industry that Colorado is open for business as tariffs, shifting federal rules, supply chain crunches and market uncertainty risk delaying investment in these affordable domestic energy resources,” wrote Polis. “In addition, we have a time-limited window for procurement of tax-advantaged wind and solar. … Getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers; by maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they’re available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the state can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.”

Polis’ Aug. 1 letter also included other initiatives, including evaluating the impact on rates for Coloradans associated with tariffs and expiration of the PTC and ITC.

California

In September, the California Legislature sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a slate of energy bills, including S.B. 302, which excludes elective payment and the transfer of certain energy tax credits from California gross income to incentivize renewable energy production in the Golden State.

Others, aimed at incentivizing, through financing and other means, the pursuit of green and renewable energy. One bill, A.B. 1207, extended and renamed through 2045 the state’s Air Resources Boards’ cap-and-invest program. The piece aims to adopt greenhouse gas emissions limits and emissions reduction measures.

The state Assembly also sent to Newsom’s desk A.B. 1408, which requires electric utilities and the California Independent System Operator to evaluate, consider and integrate interconnection as part of power transmission and distribution planning.

Interconnection remains an uphill battle in California, too, with engineering, electronics and technology publication TechXplore reporting that while the state has enough potential wind, solar and battery facilities to power statewide demand, they face an interconnection queue as long as five years.

Maine

In July, state utility regulators fast-tracked energy plans for nearly 1,600 gigawatt hours of power. Developers had two weeks to submit proposals. The state sought to bring enough energy generation online to power 13% of the state’s annual electrical usage. Developments that seek to use lands contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are given priority consideration.

New York

In August, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul requested state energy regulators undertake a high-level review of budget law and its impact on residents.

It’s a challenge to move quickly, however, as investigative nonprofit publication New York Focus indicated: The Empire State has approved 28 major wind and solar facilities in the past four years, but just one was operational as of a July report. Only one other was under construction.

In July, the state’s fire prevention and building code council introduced an all-electric building standard that prohibits gas and fossil fuels in most new buildings in the state.

Powering the Future

While the OBBBA creates fresh challenges, the renewable energy tax credits community has experienced adversity in the past, from launching the lifecycles of now-standard energy systems to the extension of incentives such as the ITC and PTC.

Stephanie Doyle, California state director for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a press release that progress will continue and states can play a role in that progress.

“State leadership on clean energy policy is more important now than ever,” said Doyle.",https://www.novoco.com/static/images/favicon.4c5b39a4ae2a.ico,N,,2025-11-07 09:18:07.180673

Clean energy jobs grew more than three times faster in California than the rest of the state’s economy in 2024, raising the total number of clean energy workers in the state to more than half a million, according to the tenth annual Clean Jobs California report released today by the national, nonpartisan business group E2.

“While federal actions stymie clean energy growth, California continues to prove that strong state policy is good for the economy and environment,” said Susan Nedell, senior Western advocate for E2. “During this year’s legislative session, our members helped convince state lawmakers to pass landmark climate bills like extending the Cap-and-Invest program through 2045 and opening the door to a stronger regional grid through the Pathways Initiative.”

Jobs in batteries, energy efficiency, storage and grid, and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, accounting for an increasingly large share of the state’s workforce. Energy efficiency hosts more than half of California’s clean energy jobs, responsible for 312,090 in 2024.

However, renewable energy generation saw a slight dip after hitting a record high of 136,591 workers at the end of 2023. Clean vehicles also took a hit across the country, along with internal combustion engine vehicles, and California saw a similar decline losing 2,822 clean vehicle-related jobs.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration — to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape – have already caused major job losses in the clean energy industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled more than $2.2 billion in planned clean energy related factories and other projects in California that were expected to create thousands of new jobs.

As clean energy companies and investors are reeling from federal decisions to slash clean energy support, the sector’s importance to the region’s overall economy is clearer than ever. Clean energy now accounts for 79 percent of all energy and vehicle-related jobs in the state, and three percent of all jobs. Industry-wide, nearly 55 percent of the sector’s jobs (about 360,000 jobs) are in construction or manufacturing.

“Energy efficiency remains the quickest and most affordable way to address GHG emissions from our built environment, the biggest sector of California’s clean economy, and yet remains under the radar and under resourced. This is why we have just launched the CA Building Performance Hub to directly support buildings statewide in reaching their energy efficiency goals,” said Ben Stapleton, Executive Director of the U.S. Green Building Council California (USGBC-CA). “California continues to leverage its position as the world’s fourth largest economy to secure billions in community investment, lower energy costs for ratepayers, and strengthen grid reliability.”

Los Angeles County is home to more than 102,000 clean energy workers, more than any county in America. A note on demographics, veterans made up 9.4% of the state’s clean energy workforce in 2024.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report. The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors.

In addition, the 2025 USEER relies on a unique supplemental survey of 42,800 business representatives across the United States. Created and conducted by BW Research, the methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and U.S. Department of Energy. This survey is used to identify energy-related employment within key subsectors of the broader industries as classified by the BLS and to assign them into their component energy and energy efficiency sectors.

Health insurance is not a luxury.","Open enrollment to sign up for health coverage on Idaho’s state health insurance exchange (Your Health Idaho) is underway in Idaho, running from Oct. 15 through Dec. 15, and this year comes with new challenges for thousands of Idahoans. Unless Congress acts, the enhanced premium tax credits (ePTCs) that have made health insurance more affordable will expire on Dec. 31, forcing families and small business owners to face dramatic increases in their monthly payments.

The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

Tax credits to help families afford their health insurance have been around for over 10 years. A few years ago, Congress enhanced them because families needed extra support to maintain their coverage. These ePTCs reduced what people pay each month for their health insurance and expanded eligibility so that no household would spend more than 8.5% of income on monthly payments. The “tax credit cliff” was also removed which left middle-income families paying disproportionately high premiums simply because they earned slightly above the cutoff.

The results were immediate and meaningful. Idaho families saved an average of $700 a year, and more than 86% of Idahoans enrolled used these tax credits. Subsequently we saw more people enroll, which creates stability and keeps costs lower for everyone.

That progress is at risk. With the expiration of the ePTCs, health insurance payments are rising again. For many Idaho families and small business owners, those higher monthly payments add up to thousands of dollars more a year. For others, especially those who are self-employed or running small businesses, the increase could make coverage completely out of reach.

According to recent estimates, 25,000 Idahoans are expected to drop their insurance if the ePTCs aren’t made permanent. For a family of four in Idaho, annual costs could increase by more than $6,000, forcing many to choose between keeping their health insurance and paying for other essentials like rent, childcare, or transportation. For some families, costs will triple because the “tax credit cliff” will be reinstated.

Those statistics represent real people and real sacrifices. In every part of Idaho, families are trying to make hard choices about how to balance their budgets while protecting their health. A rancher in eastern Idaho, a child care provider in Twin Falls, or a young family in Lewiston could each be one unexpected bill away from losing the security that health insurance provides.

When people can’t afford their monthly payments, they often put off preventive care, skip prescriptions, or wait until they’re seriously ill before seeking help. That leads to higher costs and worse health outcomes, not only for those families, but for the entire health system. Hospitals, health care providers, and rural clinics all feel the strain when more people go uninsured.

The ePTCs were a proven solution. They lowered costs and expanded coverage. Letting them expire undermines that progress and risks reversing the historic coverage gains we’ve seen over the past few years.

Congress has an opportunity to fix this. Lawmakers should act quickly to permanently extend the ePTCs, ensuring families, small business owners, and self-employed workers can continue to afford health insurance. This is not a partisan issue. It’s about protecting the health and economic stability of Idaho families and communities.

Health insurance is not a luxury. It’s a foundation that allows families to stay healthy and productive. Idaho families deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing they can see a doctor when they need to without wondering how they’ll pay for it. Congress should act now to make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent and keep healthcare within reach for every Idahoan.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2211388790-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:07:42.184146
,Texas American Energy ,2025-11-07 11:39:57+00:00,Oklahoma Voice,Cuts to renewable energy incentives will drive up consumer costs in Oklahoma,"Mike Altshuler, Hugh Jackson, John Thompson",,,,,https://oklahomavoice.com/2025/11/07/cuts-to-renewable-energy-incentives-will-drive-up-consumer-costs-in-oklahoma/,"Without tax credits the cost of wind and solar plants will go up.
That shift will hit states hardest that do not diversify their energy resources and require that a specified percentage of the electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resources.
In Oklahoma, Energy Innovation predicts that electricity rates for residential, commercial and industrial consumers will grow between 60% and 350% over the next decade.
Over-reliance on gas plants, coupled with mistaken assumptions about their reliability, is a significant grid vulnerability.
Throwing new gas plants at the problem is an ineffectual attempt to keep up with energy demand predictions.","More than 40% of Oklahoma’s energy generation comes from wind turbines and solar companies are showing increased interest in building projects in the state. Yet Oklahoma’s position as a top-tier renewable energy producer may fade following the passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Signed into law July 4, the megabill slashed tax incentives for wind and solar projects that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which were lauded as the U.S.’s first climate change mitigation law and passed during the Biden administration.

These cuts are expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Without tax credits the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies will most likely respond by building fewer of these projects, and those facilities that do come on line will be much more costly.

When that occurs, it’s expected that the country will increase generation of electricity from natural gas plants which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar operations.

That shift will hit states hardest that do not diversify their energy resources and require that a specified percentage of the electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resources.

In Oklahoma, Energy Innovation predicts that electricity rates for residential, commercial and industrial consumers will grow between 60% and 350% over the next decade. That means $100 annual increases in household energy bills by 2030 and $540 by 2035. There is also a dire forecast for decreased economic activity. Their modeling suggests that Oklahoma will lose out on significant planned private investment and suffer job losses.

These cuts along with multiple laws passed by the 2025 Oklahoma Legislature that tightened regulations on wind and solar energy will at the very least slow down if not effectively stop the state’s renewable energy development.

The One Big Beautiful Bill was signed into law about two weeks after representatives from utilities and the Southwest Power Pool warned the Oklahoma Corporation Commission that the state would see a significant energy demand that is likely to outgrow its current supply.

Clearly, our electric utilities and regulators were caught off guard by the biggest jump in demand in a generation. One of the things they didn’t properly plan for is artificial intelligence, an immensely power-hungry technology, and the accompanying explosion in data centers.

One data center today consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but some of those currently under construction will require 20 times more.

As projections soar the question about the energy sources that will power the increased demand remain unanswered.

Natural gas in Oklahoma makes up about half of its generation. But it’s unclear if an adequate number of new plants will be built in time since gas-fired turbines, which are used in a majority of the country’s facilities, are backlogged for up to seven years.

Over-reliance on gas plants, coupled with mistaken assumptions about their reliability, is a significant grid vulnerability.

Gas plant operations are particularly susceptible to damage and disruptions during extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and severe as the climate changes. Remember in 2021 Winter Storm Uri hit the central United States and knocked nearly a quarter of the affected area’s power plant capacity offline. Gas plants accounted for most of the failed capacity.

Utilities can bolster grid reliability by utilizing clean energy solutions. Pursuing clean energy solutions instead of fossil fuels lessens not only global warming emissions but also toxic air pollutants that harm public health, particularly in communities of color where gas plants are disproportionately located. Further, these demand-side solutions can reduce the need for new infrastructure and decrease the land-use impacts that come with large-scale projects.

Ratepayers should not bear the burden of hosting dirty gas plants whose pollution puts their health at risk nor should they be responsible for the infrastructure and service costs associated with rapid load growth due to large users such as data

Our legislators, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as well as utilities themselves should create unique electricity rate structures, or tariffs, for data centers. What this means is that data centers should be subject to rates, terms, and conditions that are more appropriate to how they use energy and their impact on the grid. Utility costs have long been assigned to the customers that cause those costs, at least in theory.

Meanwhile, utilities must prioritize the use of renewables, efficiency, energy storage, and other grid-supporting technologies to meet this demand.

Throwing new gas plants at the problem is an ineffectual attempt to keep up with energy demand predictions. We must recognize the paradigm shift that load growth from data centers represent and stop trying to solve new problems with old tools.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Evergy-Lawrence-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 06:59:16.341280

The raid attracted timely headlines and even approval for the regional governor, Cláudio Castro, an ally of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier.
The purpose of the mayors’ summit, Khan says, is to push regional politicians, often backed by more progressive urban electorates, to go further in doing something about it.
“We get nada, nothing,” she says when asked about government funding for policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change.
It endures three heatwaves a year these days; hot days can be followed by storms, with hailstones the size of tennis balls.","Wooden stakes bearing pictures of young men were driven into the yellow sands of Copacabana beach this week, opposite Rio de Janeiro’s swanky hotels on Avenida Atlântica where 300 mayors and their entourages were staying during the C40 World Mayors Summit.

Smiling up at the mayors in their hotel suites were photographs of four officers killed in what was the deadliest police raid in Brazilian history, just a few days before the summit. A further 117 people were killed in the operation in two of Rio’s largest clusters of favelas – the Complexo do Alemão and the Complexo da Penha – in what the police said was a clampdown on organised crime.

The raid attracted timely headlines and even approval for the regional governor, Cláudio Castro, an ally of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier.

The protest was an inauspicious start to a week in which Rio was hosting not only the C40 World Mayors Summit on climate change, co-chaired by London’s Sadiq Khan and Rio’s Social Democratic mayor, Eduardo Paes, but also Prince William’s Earthshot prize event. On Monday, Cop30 climate talks will start in the port city of Belém, 2,000 miles to the north.

Last week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, acknowledged in an interview with the Guardian that it was now “inevitable” that humanity would overshoot the target set in Paris in 2015 of limiting global heating to 1.5C (2.7F), with “devastating consequences” for the world.

Globally, despite extreme heat, floods and devastating wildfires, populist leaders, some sceptical but others in outright denial about the science, are talking up the costs of action rather than the consequences of inaction.

The purpose of the mayors’ summit, Khan says, is to push regional politicians, often backed by more progressive urban electorates, to go further in doing something about it.

Cities account for 75% of global carbon emissions, he says. It was repeatedly noted that the second-biggest delegation after the Brazilians at the summit was the US one, with about 100 mayors attending in defiance of the White House – no high-level members of the Trump administration are expected to attend the Cop30 talks.

Khan says: “Mayors across the globe, and I include London, are good examples of leaders, politicians, actually taking action.” His fellow city leaders are not just tinkering at the edges, he says, but seeking to turn the tide in the face of deniers such as Donald Trump, swirling misinformation, a doubting public and thorny, even violent, local politics.

We talk to six mayors on what they are doing about the climate crisis:

Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr

Mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone; population 1.4 million

It had been a difficult few days for Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr. Shortly before getting on a plane from Sierre Leone in west Africa to Brazil a lorry drove into her parked car on a street in Freetown, crushing the side in which she usually sits.

She was not in the car at the time but then half an hour later it emerged that her driver’s house was on fire. What caused that? “Unknown, unknown,” she says.

“But there are a few things going on: I’m running for president, and I’ve been very vocal on narcotics,” she adds, calling it: “A series of unfortunate events.”

It is not the first time she has had to face such threats but, she says: “You can’t obsess about it or you wouldn’t get anything done.”

The impact of extreme weather, landslides and flooding has led to a burgeoning population in Aki-Sawyerr’s city, as subsistence farmers have concluded that they cannot make a living off the land.

In 2015, the city’s population was just over a million. That is expected to double by 2028. One consequence is a rising number of informal settlements replacing forests on the hillsides around the capital, and ever more logging to feed the wood-burning stoves that remain widespread, adding to the city’s carbon emissions.

Aki-Sawyerr has few powers as mayor beyond sanitation. Much of her time is spent trying to use her role to get international financing for projects such as a cable car system to reduce vehicle emissions, or the planting of 5 million trees by 2030.

But how to stop people cutting those trees down? That’s where her sanitation powers come in. “We’re actually converting faecal sludge into briquettes as an alternative cooking fuel,” she says.

“It is odourless, it’s dried, it’s carbonised – and by the end of December, we will have a machine that we’re importing that will enable us to produce the briquettes at scale.

“We’ve tested in homes, we’ve put them out to communities, and they’ve been really well received. What we haven’t been able to do is to produce them at scale.”

Giuseppe Sala

Mayor of Milan, Italy; population 1.4 million

It amazes Giuseppe Sala, a member of the Italian Green party and the mayor of Milan for nearly 10 years, how little he sees of Giorgia Meloni, the far-right prime minister of Italy. She has been to the city perhaps three times in as many years, he says.

She has, however, expressed her concerns about the “ideological” nature of the European Green Deal plan to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

One of the projects Sala thinks the rest of Italy could learn from is a campaign called “I don’t waste”, which involves primary school pupils being given a reusable bag to take home any uneaten food from school lunches. City hall calculations suggest it saves approximately 10,000 sandwiches, 9,000 pieces of fruit and 1,000 desserts from being wasted every month.

He has also brought in a low-emission zone to Milan, the largest in the EU that bans non-compliant cars. Milan remains congested but the air quality is improving and after a difficult first year it has been accepted by the public, he says.

Two months ago, he banned private vehicles entirely from the roads around Via Monte Napoleone, the city’s fashion centre. “Always make step by step,” he says, though he expects the 2027 mayoral election to be dominated by the issue, with his opponents insisting: “You have the right to drive your car where you want.”

“So that will be a good moment to see if the sensitivity of the people could change,” he says.

Nick Reece

Mayor of Melbourne, Australia; metro population 5.4 million

It was when a new planning application for a £100m datacentre came across his desk that Nick Reece, lord mayor for a year in the south-eastern Australian city of Melbourne, started asking questions.

“I was asking the team: what’s the energy consumption going to be of this new data centre?” he says. The answer was that these computing facilities would account for a fifth of the city’s energy consumption by 2040.

He is now lobbying for a national and international set of rules to govern datacentres. “If we don’t get some framework in place, which means that these new datacentres are principally powered by renewable power, then we are not going to be able to achieve our carbon-reduction targets,” he says.

“We don’t want to see a race to the bottom around artificial-intelligence infrastructure.”

Reece also wants companies to consider how to best use the energy produced by the centres, such as heating swimming pools in the city, which often rely on gas-fired boilers.

“In the race to become smart cities, we don’t want to cook the planet,” he says. “That would be ironic and a tragedy.”

Kate Gallego

Mayor of Phoenix, US; population 1.6 million

Last year, the city of Phoenix, Arizona, broke its own temperature record with 113 days above 100F (38C). “We hit 110 [fahrenheit] in October, which had never happened before,” she says.

“Close to Halloween, the pumpkins that my kids had, they sort of melted. It really was very serious. The first week of school for my eight-year-old [this year], we had 118[F]; they couldn’t go outside,” she says.

“I think that has helped us with the political consensus.”

Even for Phoenix, a city in the desert, this was extreme but looking across the world it was an extraordinary year. “We talked to the UK’s fire department about how we manage heat and how we keep our firefighters safe during heatwaves,” Gallego says.

While Phoenix burns, however, Donald Trump has turned off the financial taps. “We benefited enormously from the renewable energy tax credits, so losing those has been very difficult, and makes it more complex to finance projects,” she says.

“We received a significant grant called Solar For All [for low-income and disadvantaged households], which we are losing. Our electric vehicle spending grants have been suspended.

“The change in administration has dramatically impacted the amount of federal support we received.”

The state of Arizona voted for Trump, but Gallego says the extreme temperatures meant there was significant support for policies that both reduced emissions, such as investment in a light railway, and offered some mitigation, such as coating pavements with cooling materials so they absorb less heat, lowering the temperature of the streets and ensuring fewer potholes emerge as a result of the asphalt expanding and shrinking.

Carolina Basualdo

Mayor of Despeñaderos, Argentina; population, 9,000

It is yet to be seen whether anyone from the Argentinian government will turn up in Belém for the Cop30 climate talks. Like Trump, the country’s president, Javier Milei, does not accept the scientific consensus about the human-made impact on the climate. He has called the crisis a “socialist lie”.

What this means for Carolina Basualdo, the mayor of a small city in the Córdoba region in the centre of the country, is clear. “We get nada, nothing,” she says when asked about government funding for policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change.

The impact of the crisis on her city is clear, she says. It endures three heatwaves a year these days; hot days can be followed by storms, with hailstones the size of tennis balls. Basualdo has rolled out a programme of solar panels on roofs, standardised the temperature at 24C (75F) in municipal buildings to save on energy consumption from air conditioning, and is using pruning waste from parks as an environmentally friendly source of firewood for boilers.

Plastic polytunnels used by farms for the production of fruit are recycled into bags and wallets by women at a local gender violence refuge. The mayor, with funds from Bloomberg Philanthropies, was able to help a local basketball club to replace its granite floor with one from two tonnes of plastic bottle caps collected by the community. “We’ve been working very hard,” she says.

Evandro Leitão

Mayor of Fortaleza, Brazil, population 2.7 million

“He was isolated and just did what he wanted,” says Evandro Leitão, mayor of Fortaleza, the fourth-biggest city in Brazil, known for its stifling heat. He is talking about Jair Bolsonaro, the former president who was jailed in September for 27 years for conspiring to overturn his 2022 election loss to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is in the same Workers’ party as Leitão.

Bolsonaro slashed environmental protections and promoted clearing and settling the Amazon rainforest. His administration oversaw a 60% increase in deforestation rates – the highest relative increase in a presidential term since satellite monitoring began. Lula has signalled that he wants Brazil to be a climate powerhouse, investing in renewable energy and forest conservation.

In the last 10 months that he has been mayor, Leitão has overseen the latest construction of micro-parks in his city, expanding the amount of green space by 40%, equivalent to 4,100 football pitches in five years.

There are, however, concerns being raised about the Brazilian government’s recent announcement that it is suspending the soy moratorium, which recognised deforestation as a threat posed by clearing land for the legume.

Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras has also been given permission to drill for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River. “You have to be a great balance between the development of the country, but also to preserve the green areas of the country,” Leitão said. That’s a challenge that I have to struggle with, too.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/191687dfe3e1b209f931037b474e3bd051ee6039/288_0_3348_2678/master/3348.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1122c6ab9acafdb5b18269159ca4659",N,,2025-11-07 06:59:09.203293

She also leads the Public Lands Council, which represents cattle and sheep ranchers with federal grazing permits.
“Steve’s leadership will be invaluable in managing our public lands and wisely stewarding our resources,” Senate Western Caucus Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said in a statement.
In a statement to Inside Climate News, the Trump administration doubled down on increasing oil and gas as a main goal.
“President Trump was elected with an overwhelming mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash America’s energy potential,” said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House.","President Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped a conservation critic and former oil industry executive to head up the federal agency that oversees the majority of public lands in the United States.

If approved, former U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico will lead the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for balancing conservation of public lands with human use, such as resource extraction and cattle grazing. Since January, the Trump administration has overwhelmingly prioritized the latter with the Department of the Interior—BLM’s parent agency—rapidly approving oil, gas and mining permits, including more than 600 new permits to drill on public lands since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities.

Environmental groups have spoken out vehemently against Pearce, who they say will threaten public lands and ramp up activities that fuel global warming.

A veteran and former owner of an oilfield services company, Pearce began his foray into politics as the U.S. representative for New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District from 2003 to 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019. Over his seven terms in the role, Pearce strongly advocated for ranchers and the oil and gas drilling sector, the latter of which donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns. Now, industry groups are rallying around Pearce’s nomination.

“Pearce’s experience makes him thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing,” Kaitlynn Glover with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement. She also leads the Public Lands Council, which represents cattle and sheep ranchers with federal grazing permits.

Republican politicians from ranch- and oil-heavy states such as Montana and Wyoming echoed these sentiments.

“Steve’s leadership will be invaluable in managing our public lands and wisely stewarding our resources,” Senate Western Caucus Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said in a statement. “This nomination is a major win for Wyoming and the entire west, and I’m glad to see such a crucial role filled by someone so well qualified. I urge a swift confirmation.”

Meanwhile, conservation groups argue that Pearce is not fit to lead an agency that also manages some of the most ecologically sensitive lands in the country, open spaces that support clean water, clean air and wildlife. As a congressman, Pearce introduced or supported several public-lands bills that would have inhibited conservation, supported more climate-warming oil and gas operations and limited the power of the Antiquities Act, which gives the president authority to protect lands by designating them as national monuments.

In 2014, he opposed former President Barack Obama’s designation of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico, which had widespread public support in the region. He has said that the monument, which fell within his district, was too large. The protected area is now a major driver of tourism and income for the local community of Las Cruces.

The nonprofit League of Conservation Voters, which tracks congressional voting records on environmental issues, gives Pearce a score of 4 percent—with 13 votes over his career that the group classified as pro-environment and more than 330 deemed anti-environment.

“Pearce’s entire political career has been dedicated to blocking Americans’ access to public lands while giving the oil and gas industry free rein to drill and frack anywhere they wanted,” Jennifer Rokala, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement. “Congress should quickly reject this nomination and tell the president to pay attention to what voters overwhelmingly want—public lands that are protected and managed for our kids and grandkids.”

The nomination comes seven months after Trump’s former pick, Kathleen Sgamma, the head of an oil industry trade group, withdrew from consideration following reporting that she had privately criticized Trump in 2021.

The Trump Public Lands Agenda

Democratic politicians have also expressed concern over the Pearce nomination, including Deb Haaland, the former interior secretary under President Joe Biden, who called him a “dangerous choice.”

During her four-year tenure at the Interior Department, Haaland oversaw BLM’s operations and helped enact the 2024 Public Lands Rule, which placed conservation on equal footing with uses such as natural gas drilling, mining, ranching, grazing, timber production and recreation. In September the Trump administration declared its intent to rescind the rule.

“In New Mexico we value our lands and waters, and we need a manager who would be a good steward. Steve Pearce however, has a record of threatening New Mexico’s public lands, putting profits over people, and neglecting the needs of our state,” Haaland, who is now running for New Mexico governor, said in a statement. “He is the wrong choice to serve in this role.”

Since Trump re-entered office in January, the administration has coordinated an aggressive rollback of environmental laws and policies in the United States in a push to ramp up extractive activities on public lands.

In July, the White House began the process of changing how the landmark National Environmental Policy Act is implemented across the federal government in a manner that allows the fast-tracking of fossil fuel, mining and other industrial projects. One of the first to benefit from these streamlined reviews is a gold mine project in Nevada, with far less opportunity for public comment on its permitting. Opponents fear the lack of review will threaten key aquifers and land for vulnerable animals such as the sage grouse.

Along with fast-tracking permits, the Trump administration is opening more lands for oil drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Dan Ritzman, the director of conservation at the nonprofit Sierra Club, expects Pearce would run BLM in line with this pro-extractive agenda.

“Steve Pearce is right in line with the Trump’s administration’s vision that the most important use and the people that should have the most say in our public lands are oil and gas industry executives,” Ritzman said.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, the Trump administration doubled down on increasing oil and gas as a main goal.

“President Trump was elected with an overwhelming mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash America’s energy potential,” said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House. “It’s totally logical that his nominees would align with the agenda the President was elected to implement and have a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-534007574-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:07:37.991910

Learn About: 3 Advanced Investing Moves Experts Use to Minimize Taxes and Help Boost Returns

Here are six warning signs every investor should know about Tesla stock.

1. Sky-High Valuation

This may be the biggest red flag of all when it comes to Tesla stock. The company presently has a market capitalization of $1.434 trillion. Yet, according to NPR, profits declined 13.5% in Q2. Q3 may see a surge in revenue as consumers purchased cars ahead of the expiration of electrical vehicle (EV) tax cuts, but that’s a temporary gain.

As of Oct. 10, 2025, Tesla’s profit-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was $258.73. Keep in mind that the P/E ratio is the amount investors are willing to spend for a dollar of a company’s earnings. So, Tesla investors are paying over $250 for every one dollar of earnings. By contrast, Ford Motor Company’s P/E ratio is $14.80. Even tech darling Nvidia has a P/E ratio of $55.08.

2. New Ventures

It can be challenging to compare Tesla to other companies because, while it is an auto company, it also has many new tech-adjacent businesses in the pipeline. If all of these ventures, like self-driving cars and robotics, pan out as expected, the company’s performance will likely align with expectations. But that is far from certain. The market’s willingness to price in projects that are still in development is concerning.

3. Concentrated Leadership

As Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk can be an asset and a liability. His energy and creativity have certainly brought the company to where it is today, and his words and actions can affect the movement of the stock. But there is a risk that he could lose focus by exploring too many new ventures at once, and his political stances are bound up with regulatory decisions that would affect the business.

This year also saw the Tesla Takedown boycott in response to Musk’s public persona, and a National Bureau of Economic Research study claims his public behavior has cost the company the sale of 1.25 million vehicles over the past three years. At about $40,000 per vehicle, that’s a colossal opportunity cost in the realm of a $50 billion blunder, if accurate.

4. Subsidies and Incentives

Manufacturing subsidies and incentives for consumers to purchase have greatly aided the adoption of electric vehicles. While these programs have been effective in advancing EVs’ popularity, the industry’s dependence on them in general, and Tesla in particular, is a red flag.

Programs that make it less expensive to manufacture electric vehicles include the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit, which provides a tax credit for companies that expand clean energy manufacturing and recycling capacity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at industrial facilities.

Consumer incentives, including federal, state, and local tax credits, were implemented to increase consumer adoption of electric vehicles. Some state and local incentives remain, but the federal Clean New Vehicle Credit expired on Sept. 30, 2025. If more programs like these are scaled back or eliminated, the cost of EVs will rise, which could impact Tesla’s earnings.

5. Competitive Pressures

Tesla didn’t invent the electric car — that happened in the 1800s, according to the U.S Department of Energy. But electric vehicles became mainstream around the turn of the millennium, when Toyota’s Prius and Honda’s Insight hybrids began to be sold in the U.S. When Tesla introduced the Model S, it brought luxury to the EV market, and the company quickly became the leader in the industry.

With 30 different companies now selling electric vehicles in the U.S., according to Car and Driver, competition is heating up. Automakers from Fiat to Rolls Royce have electric options, and the variety of available vehicles will ultimately lead to cost and price pressure.

6. Price Volatility

Any investor who has held on to Tesla stock for a while can vouch for how volatile it is. From the start of the year to Oct. 10, 2025, the stock is up 8.86%. Over the past 12 months, however, it’s up 84.12%. Clearly, the price spike at the end of 2024 is responsible for this discrepancy, but that’s a glaring comparison.

Another notable metric is the stock’s 52-week range of $212.11-$488.54. Analysts’ price targets are also all over the map, ranging from $120-$600 per share. The average 12-month target is $360.63, compared with the stock’s current price of $439.51.

It’s hard to say if Tesla stock is a good buy at this point — even the analysts are split pretty much down the middle. Keeping these warning signs in mind can help you make an informed choice about this stock.

Rebates for electric vehicles have already ended, but there is still time to claim home energy efficiency tax credits before they expire.

Many upgrades are still eligible for tax credits as long as the work is completed before Dec. 31.

People can claim up to $2,000 for installing a heat pump HVAC system or heat pump water heater. Insulation and weatherization projects could be worth up to $1,200 in tax credits. Homeowners can claim up to $150 for a home energy audit, which can help them create a plan for future upgrades.

Julia Kortrey with Evergreen Action says in 2023 alone, more than 158,000 Pennsylvania households claimed more than $267 million in tax credits.

She said it’s important to update the commonwealth’s old housing stock with efficiency upgrades for long-term comfort and affordability benefits. More efficient housing can also help ensure a reliable electric grid, she said.

“Now is the time to lock in savings while you still can,” Kortrey said. “Pennsylvanians deserve to keep their homes comfortable, their bills manageable, and their energy reliable long after these credits are gone.”

Dan Taylor with the labor and environmental coalition BlueGreen Alliance said, in addition to saving people money, the credits were designed to create jobs by boosting domestic manufacturing through creating demand for American-made products. He said the cuts jeopardize 338,000 jobs nationwide.

He said it’s important for as many people to take advantage of the credits while they’re still available.

“Ideally, we do want policy makers to realize the importance of tax credits like these to building out that clean energy future,” Taylor said.

At the center of this system is a $150 million “catastrophe bond,” which the country first issued to investors in 2021 and renewed last year.
The catastrophe bond market has been growing since Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992.
(The CCRIF policy pays out rapidly for a range of types of hurricane damage, whereas the catastrophe bond is only triggered by the most extreme storms.)
On Oak Island in North Carolina, for example, the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association has sponsored a catastrophe bond that includes a resilience feature.","Trelawney Parish sits in a rural, agricultural region of Western Jamaica that borders the country’s largest contiguous rainforest. Under normal circumstances, the parish is relentlessly green — covered in lush vegetation and long rows of orange trees — but the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa has “almost completely annihilated” the area, according to firefighter Ronell Hamilton. “Everything here is brown right now. It looks like California.”

The strongest storm to strike Jamaica in recorded history, Melissa arrived on the island last week as a Category 5 storm with wind speeds of 185 miles per hour. As of press time, at least 67 people had been killed — 32 in Jamaica, 34 from flooding in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and thousands of homes have been flattened. In Black River, a coastal community south of Trelawney that is being called the storm’s epicenter, an estimated 90 percent of structures were destroyed. Thirty miles north, in Wakefield, Hamilton says that even buildings built to serve as hurricane shelters, such as the school and the fire station, were severely damaged.

Climate change is making monster storms like Melissa more powerful by supercharging the meteorological elements in which they thrive: Warming ocean waters feed hurricanes, as does warming air. Studies have shown that the atmosphere can hold 7 percent more moisture for every 1 degree Celsius of warming. Elevated wind speeds allow storms to carry more moisture as well, leaving devastating flooding in their wake. A rapid analysis from Imperial College London found that climate change made a massive storm like Melissa 4 times more likely. Another report from the research group World Weather Attribution found that it increased wind speeds by 11 percent and rainfall by 16 percent relative to a world without global warming.

Early estimates indicate the storm may have caused up to $4 billion in insured losses and about $7 billion total in Jamaica alone. Much of the country is still without electricity or cell phone service and many roads remain impassable, so the full extent of the destruction has yet to be evaluated.

As wrenching as the storm has been, Jamaica is well aware of its vulnerabilities in a warming world and has spent decades carefully planning for just this kind of a scenario. As a result, it’s in a unique position to secure many of the resources it needs for its recovery. The country has built up a multi-layered system of financial protection since Hurricane Gilbert hit in 1988 and, experts say, its response could serve as a model for other island nations looking to build secure financial infrastructure that will ensure they can respond to disasters quickly.

At the center of this system is a $150 million “catastrophe bond,” which the country first issued to investors in 2021 and renewed last year. It will now be paid out in full to help support the country’s recovery. Catastrophe bonds appeal to investors because they offer a high reward in the form of elevated interest rates, in exchange for high risk — namely, the risk that the catastrophe will occur and trigger a monster payout from the investors. The bonds are generally set to expire in three to five years. If no disaster occurs during that period, the investors recover their initial investment as well as the exorbitant interest it has accrued. But if a storm does hit, all of the money goes to the affected country.

These bonds are attractive to buyers because they’re totally disconnected from the rest of the financial market; during the Great Recession that began in 2008, for example, catastrophe bonds became a popular financial instrument because they were still producing high yields even as benchmark interest rates were nearly 0 percent. And if all goes well, they can be enormously lucrative. They’re attractive to countries like Jamaica, because they can be triggered according to parametric standards, meaning once a storm hits a predefined limit, such as central pressure at or below 900 millibars, the money is automatically released.

The catastrophe bond market has been growing since Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992. At the time, it was the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history, and insurance proved unable to cover the full cost of the storm. “The idea was to then put some of that risk into the financial markets,” said Carolyn Kousky, associate vice president for economics and policy at the Environmental Defense Fund. Jamaica is unique, said Kousky, because it has “made this really beautiful stack [of financing tools] to cover disasters.”

In addition to the catastrophe bond, the country has built up its own emergency contingency budget, taken out parametric insurance with the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, or CCRIF, and prearranged for a credit line in case of emergencies. (The CCRIF policy pays out rapidly for a range of types of hurricane damage, whereas the catastrophe bond is only triggered by the most extreme storms.) This level of planning, said Kousky, grew out of a “growing recognition that relying on disaster aid is not a great strategy, because disaster aid often takes a long time to get to countries and can sometimes be ill matched to need.” A steady stream of pre-secured cash can help vulnerable nations better navigate these kinds of horrific events.

“The question is whether this would be available again,” said Sara Jane Ahmed, the managing director and finance advisor to the V20 Ministers of Finance, which represent the world’s most climate-vulnerable economies, who warned that a payout so large could scare off financial interests. Ahmed added that rebuilding with more resilient infrastructure could help make a new bond more appealing.

Investing in catastrophe bonds is essentially playing Russian Roulette with air pressure — even a storm as strong as Hurricane Beryl, which made landfall near Jamaica last year as a Category 4, did not quite meet the threshold for a payout. And as climate change causes storms to grow stronger, investors could shy away from catastrophe bonds or insist on even higher interest rates and more stringent metrics for a payout.

“People are looking for a silver bullet for all these things and everything has a tradeoff,” said Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness.

“The biggest problem with catastrophe bonds is that they come after the disaster, not before, to prevent it from happening, [which] is where the money is needed most,” he said, pointing to infrastructure upgrades, seawalls, and other hurricane-proofing measures as areas where catastrophe bond investors could also support adaptation efforts before the storm — and reduce their own risk of a bond payout in the process. “If these same companies are investing in catastrophe bonds, and they don’t want to see the payouts, then better investment in preventing the disaster to begin with is the best way to kind of protect that investment. We need it on all sides.”

The question of how to pull investors into the adaptation market is “an ongoing challenge,” said Kousky. “When you invest in climate adaptation and risk reduction … you’re reducing future losses, but avoided losses are not really a cash flow.”

Tweaking catastrophe bonds to direct a small amount of their interest back to the issuing state or country could offer one solution. On Oak Island in North Carolina, for example, the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association has sponsored a catastrophe bond that includes a resilience feature. When no catastrophe strikes and investors collect their yearly returns, a portion of their profits are put towards funding home hardening upgrades, like hurricane-fortified roofs.

“We’re always going to have disasters,” said Schlegelmilch. “But they don’t have to be as bad as they are.”

How Jamaica’s recovery will play out on the ground remains to be seen. The damages look like they will exceed even the country’s carefully planned financial safety net. A week after the storm, “there’s still no electricity, still no water,” said Hamilton, the firefighter in Trelawney Parish. “Food is running out.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hurricane-Melissa-Black-River.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-07 10:04:11.831758

Utah is well known for using a variety of methods and approaches to energy generation. Beaver and Millard counties in central Utah are a corridor for wind farms, solar plants and geothermal exploration. Those projects have garnered international attention.

But the Beehive State still relies heavily on fossil fuels as well.

The latest sustainable method the state is interested in pursuing is nuclear energy alternatives.

The new news

Millions of Americans across all 50 states have incorporated clean energy technologies into their lives, according to Clean Energy Across America,” a new report unveiled Wednesday by Environment America Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group. The report details that growth and recommends tips and policies to help more Americans adopt clean energy, even as federal tax credits phase out.

“You cannot put a lid on solar,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, Environment America Research & Policy Center.

The group has dissected the numbers to produce a dashboard: The state of renewable energy, which tracks the 10-year growth trends of six key clean energy technologies by state.

Clean Energy Across America focuses on the number of individual Americans by state who have adopted technologies such as electric vehicles, solar panels and home battery storage systems that have made their lives cleaner and better.

“Across the country, people have invested their own time and money to install solar panels on their roofs, put EVs in their driveways, make their homes energy efficient, or buy clean energy from their utilities,” said Emily Rusch, vice president and senior director of state offices of Environment America Research and Policy Center.

“Clean energy adoption in America is a movement hiding in plain sight.”

Utah, despite its reputation as a fossil fuel hungry state, has embraced solar.

The 14th annual National Solar Jobs Census by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, an independent nonprofit organization, found the United States added 15,564 solar jobs in 2023, when there were 279,447 solar workers, the highest ever recorded.

In Utah, solar jobs increased by 4% with 325 jobs added, for a total of 7,634 jobs statewide.

A difficult dance

Last year, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced the launch of Operation Gigawatt, a plan to double energy in Utah in the next decade.

It is a bold goal, and not without its critics, but Cox has put all his cards on the table.

Neumann said Utah is primed for energy innovation.

“The sun shows up every day for free,” she said, adding that Utah is among the top ranking states for its solar capacity.

According to the latest statistics, there are 78,617 solar panels in Utah. That equates to 224 panels for every 10,000 people.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/8b44cdead6d42d9cf25c5801f0626018,N,,2025-11-07 05:19:10.794693

Rising electricity prices across Europe are prompting electric vehicle (EV) owners to seek smarter, more efficient charging solutions. In January 2025, household electricity costs varied widely - from 0.091 per kWh in Budapest to 0.404 per kWh in Berlin - with the EU average reaching 0.255 per kWh. Germany recorded rates of about 0.38 per kWh, among the highest in the region. These figures underscore the growing importance of energy management in everyday EV ownership.

At the same time, solar power adoption continues to accelerate. In 2024, global solar PV installations rose by 597 GW - a 33% year-on-year increase - followed by an additional 380 GW added in the first half of 2025, representing a 64% rise compared with the same period in 2024. This rapid expansion reflects a collective move toward energy independence and cost stability through renewable generation.

As solar adoption grows, the emphasis is shifting from generation to intelligent utilisation. Rather than exporting surplus energy to the grid at low feed-in rates, households are choosing to use it directly. Smart EV chargers with solar integration, such as Teltonika EVC 2, make this possible by detecting when solar generation exceeds household demand and redirecting the surplus into an EV battery. In doing so, sunlight is transformed into measurable financial and environmental value - reducing dependence on costly grid electricity and optimising the use of self-produced energy.

Economic Efficiency of Smart EV Charging

With electricity costs high and solar capacity expanding, efficient self-consumption has become a practical necessity.

Real-world EV consumption averages approximately 0.21 kWh per km. Based on the EU's average grid electricity price of 0.255 per kWh, the cost equates to 0.0536 per km, or 53.60 per 1,000 km. Over 15,000 km of annual driving, this totals 3,150 kWh. A solar-integrated smart charging system that supplies 60% of this energy would save approximately 482 per year compared with full grid reliance.

European Incentives and Subsidies

Governments across Europe continue to promote renewable-powered EV charging:

United Kingdom: Smart charging incentives and household energy protections.

Germany: Regional support for home-based EV charging installations.

European Commission: Ongoing investment in renewable integration and sustainable infrastructure.

A solar-aware smart charger with an installation cost of 2,500 and 800 covered by incentives achieves an estimated payback period of 3.5 years. Beyond that, every kilometre driven using solar energy effectively becomes cost-free - combining sustainability with long-term financial benefit.

How Smart EV Charging Systems Operate

Smart EV chargers are designed to maximise the efficiency of each kilowatt produced by solar panels. Through real-time monitoring, automation, and load management, these systems ensure cost-effective charging while maintaining safety and convenience.

Core Functions:

Solar surplus management - redirects excess solar generation to charge an EV battery instead of exporting it.

Dynamic load balancing - adjusts charging speed automatically according to total household power demand.

Smart energy mix - intelligently combines solar and grid power to minimise costs.

Connected intelligence - utilises Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and LTE for monitoring, updates, and real-time insights.

This level of coordination enables households to minimise grid usage and benefit from efficient, sustainable charging.

Design, Durability, and Integration

The most effective EV chargers combine modern aesthetics, intelligent control, and durable construction. A premium solar-compatible charger must operate efficiently across all climates while blending seamlessly with home architecture.

Teltonika EVC 2 achieves this balance through advanced phase balancing, weatherproof protection (IP56, IK10), and customisable front plates for aesthetic flexibility. Built with reliability and intelligence in mind, it represents a future-ready choice for homeowners investing in solar-integrated charging.

Key Features:

Automatic detection and redirection of surplus solar energy

Real-time load control and phase balancing

Multi-connectivity via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and LTE

Robust IP56 and IK10 protection standards

Customisable design options for modern homes

CTA: Discover EVC 2

Steps to Implement Solar-Aware Charging

Assess household setup: Evaluate solar output, wiring, and consumption.

Review incentives: Identify available subsidies or energy grants.

Select a suitable charger: Prioritise solar surplus management and smart connectivity.

Install professionally: Ensure certified setup and load management configuration.

Monitor performance: Track real-time data and optimise schedules for savings.

Future-Ready Smart Energy Solutions

With increasing energy costs and expanding solar capacity, solar-integrated EV charging is emerging as a key solution for sustainable mobility. Smart chargers enable households to manage power consumption efficiently, reduce grid dependence, and achieve faster financial returns.

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed pausing or eliminating reporting obligations under the federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), a move that could affect industrial facilities, power plants and other large-emission sources across multiple sectors.

Since its inception in 2009, the program has collected facility-level greenhouse-gas (GHG) data from more than 8,000 facilities—data that businesses, regulators and safety professionals use to evaluate emission trends, exposure risks and operational impacts.

{""\u2060""}. With the proposed rule, the agency would remove reporting requirements for roughly 46 source categories and suspend further reporting obligations in other segments until 2034. This reduction in oversight may limit the availability of key data used to assess environmental and workplace risks. EPA+2EPA+2

From a health-and-safety standpoint, the change has two major implications:

Reduced transparency of emissions data — Safety managers rely on publicly reported GHG information to evaluate evolving hazards such as high-emitting processes, potential chemical releases or climate-driven heat stress conditions tied to industrial operations. Without consistent data, hazard assessments may become less robust.

Potential shift in compliance focus — If reporting obligations decline, industry programs may need to adapt. Facilities that have invested in emissions monitoring, data systems and risk reduction tied to GHG tracking could lose key metrics that helped drive preventive safety measures.

Industrial operations—particularly in sectors like manufacturing, power generation, chemical production and heavy industry—may face a strategic decision: continue voluntary reporting and integrate the data into safety and health systems, or adjust to a baseline of reduced regulatory data collection. In either scenario, safety professionals are encouraged to review their monitoring programs, integrate emissions-related data into workplace risk assessments and maintain documentation of hazard recognition, mitigation and exposure trends.

Organizations that have linked their GHG tracking systems to broader environmental, health and safety (EHS) programs may find the proposed changes trigger internal assessments of how emissions data support worker-safety protections, energy-use controls and climate-related exposure risks.

Looking ahead, the agency is accepting public comments and may revise the proposal before finalization. Companies and safety leaders should monitor developments closely, strengthen internal data-governance practices and continue embedding emissions and climate-risk intelligence into workplace-safety frameworks.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/1107EP-Greenhouse-Gases.jpeg,N,,2025-11-07 10:03:58.449740

The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to add ample storage to its grid by the end of the decade.

The public utility announced that it was targeting up to 1.5 gigawatts of battery storage — the equivalent of one its largest gas plants under construction, like the Kingston project — by the end of 2029.

“We’re trying to drive a sense of urgency with these assets,” TVA’s chief business officer Jeremy Fisher said during a board meeting Thursday.

TVA has been expanding its system this decade, mostly with new gas plants.

Battery storage can strengthen grids, whether systems are dominated by fuels or have high renewable penetration like in California and Texas.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab has described energy storage as “crucial” to developing a resilient, low-carbon power grid.

TVA considered as much as 5 GW of storage in its last long-term plan in 2019, but the utility added just 370 megawatts, or about 0.4 GW, between 2019 and 2025.

TVA has at least 38 GW of total energy capacity, between its owned and purchased power. TVA will soon release an overview of its system in its annual financial filing to the federal government this month.

In the past fiscal year, TVA’s energy use was split between 34% gas, 33% nuclear, 19% coal, 10% hydro and 4% renewables, according to TVA’s presentation to the board on Thursday. Nuclear use dropped as the utility faced outages at all seven of its reactors this past year. The lost generation was primarily replaced by fossil fuels.

Currently, storage represents a small percentage of the utility’s capacity. TVA has some battery facilities and storage through pumped hydropower.",https://wpln.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/TVA-Battery-Storage.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 06:59:20.069932

The EU has pledged $32.5 billion in support of its clean energy manufacturing, despite its ambitious targets.
Focus on Emerging Markets In 2025, half of China’s solar exports were destined for emerging markets.
Trade Barriers According to the report, trade in emerging markets has so far been unencumbered by major tariffs.","Developed and emerging economies are expanding clean energy deployment while aiming to enhance domestic manufacturing of key technologies, according to BloombergNEF’s (BNEF) Clean Energy Trade and Emerging Markets report.

However, trade barriers are on the rise. Several prominent developing countries are considering or implementing higher import duties on cleantech products. These tariffs are driven by diverse motives: fostering local value creation, attracting foreign investment, diversifying supply chains, and addressing energy security concerns.

China’s Dominance

According to the report, China hosts at least 80% of the manufacturing capacity across major solar and battery supply chains. The country hosts over 70% of production capacity in all significant segments of clean tech equipment manufacturing except for one.

Countries including Japan, South Korea, the European Union (EU), and the U.S. comprise most of the remaining manufacturing capacity share.

Between 2022 and 2024, China’s share of global capacity increased by at least 5% across the value chain of six clean energy segments.

Steps by Developed and Emerging Countries

BNEF stated that developed nations have initiated multiple economic development strategies. Depending on the strategy, efforts to varying degrees have been focusing explicitly on building out clean-tech supply chains.

Emerging market economies, including China, have been focusing on creating domestic industrial policies to develop local cleantech manufacturing.

G20 Initiatives

G20 countries have allocated $250 billion in subsidies for clean technology manufacturing.

BNEF said it tracked subsidies for solar, battery, wind, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. It said this limited its scope to national grants, low-interest loans, loan guarantees, and tax credits.

That excludes harder-to-track forms of support, such as cheap electricity or land.

Using this methodology, the U.S. has the highest commitment in all markets, despite the revised totals following the new administration’s curtailment of previous supportive provisions.

According to the report, the earlier subsidies drove a factory pipeline worth $108 billion. However, policy changes and uncertainty have frozen several projects.

The EU has pledged $32.5 billion in support of its clean energy manufacturing, despite its ambitious targets. Much of the funding comes from repurposed programs due to limited budget.

BNEF advises member states to draw from national funds to expand their local capacities. However, it acknowledges that cheap imports, low prices, and weak manufacturers limit any impact of such initiatives.

Japan is concentrating 86% of its $30.4 billion in expected support for its battery sector to help achieve its domestic manufacturing capacity target of 150 GWh by 2030. The report stated that this goal may be difficult.

The report stated that setting up battery factories is costlier than other clean technologies. This means that even considerable government support may not result in significant manufacturing growth. Low local demand is also adding to the growth challenges.

Clean-tech manufacturing support is limited elsewhere. Multiple factors cause these limitations:

Clean-tech manufacturing often ranks low among policy priorities

Tough market conditions

High capital requirements for this segment

Average higher prices of locally produced technology compared to high-quality, low-cost imports

BNEF stated that some countries are providing relatively large subsidies for the cleantech supply chain. For example, Turkey’s $13.5 billion subsidy made up 1% of the country’s GDP in 2024.

However, emerging markets are not making significant contributions to cleantech manufacturing subsidies. This has not precluded manufacturers in China from expanding into such regions, many times without considerable local incentives.

Global Clean Tech Trade Flows

According to the report, China is the single largest clean energy component exporter. On a dollar basis, it accounted for 47% of the global solar, wind, battery, and EV exports in 2024.

The country has integrated supply chains, significantly improved economies of scale, and has intense domestic competition.

China’s export share is specifically high in the solar and battery segments, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the global total. However, its EV exports comprise only 30% of the global exports, despite significant growth.

Southeast Asia and Latin America are emerging as key exporters due to Chinese firms relocating solar manufacturing to these regions and their expansion into EV and battery production.

The U.S. and the EU are major exporters but remain net importers. They imported 47% of the worldwide total in 2024, which BNEF said explains their increasing protectionist policies.

A growing number of regions have emerged as net clean tech importers. Solar products and batteries have significantly driven imports in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)region, as well as South Asia.

Trade by Technology

Growth in trade of solar cells and modules, wind turbines and components, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, EVs, and plug-in hybrids has risen steadily in the past six years, driven by growing electric transport and Li-ion battery shipments.

Annual global imports witnessed a 126% growth between 2021 and 2024. Global Li-ion battery imports increased 96% during the same period.

Trade in such products peaked in 2023, reducing 4% to $290 billion in the following year. According to the report, this decline reflects lower equipment and EV prices instead of weaker volumes. Imports measured in unit terms rose in most cases.

However, trade in clean energy products continued to expand, contrasting the rising sentiments of protectionism and deglobalization.

Batteries and EVs make up 80% of the global clean tech value. A steep drop in module prices resulted in solar modules comprising just 18% of the total.

The report stated that shipments of wind equipment are limited. Turbine components are typically costly to transport, and a considerable amount of value addition occurs close to the demand location.

BNEF stated that solar cell and module prices have been declining due to overcapacity, particularly over the last two years. Solar cell prices dropped nearly 60% in the last year. Module prices in this period fell 44% due to extreme competition, driven by overcapacity in China, affecting the manufacturers’ margins.

In 2024, the steep price decline contributed significantly to the value of global solar shipments. However, trade of these components increased in gigawatt terms. Imports of solar modules increased 36% and those of cells rose 70% on a capacity basis.

According to the report, governments have been introducing a mix of subsidies, local content rules, and trade barriers to promote solar manufacturing. However, solar cell manufacturing takes more time to scale because it is more capital-intensive than module assemble.

EV battery prices reduced 20% over the last year. Prices for Chinese wind turbines declined 15%.

Focus on Emerging Markets

In 2025, half of China’s solar exports were destined for emerging markets. After expanding production capacity in recent years, the country’s manufacturers are increasingly targeting overseas markets to absorb their surplus output.

According to the report, defensive trade policies such as those being implemented by the U.S. could amplify these shifts.

The share of Li-ion batteries, battery EVs, solar modules, and wind turbines, described by the World Bank as “low” to “upper-middle” income, increased 27% in 2024 from 23% in 2022, reaching 31% by August 2025.

Latin America accounted for nearly 30% of emerging market clean-tech imports. It was followed by Southeast Asia, MENA, and South Asia.

Trade Barriers

According to the report, trade in emerging markets has so far been unencumbered by major tariffs.

Of the 14 markets analyzed by BNEF, the simple average import tariff on six key products in the G20, excluding the U.S., China, and Russia, as well as the African Union, was at just 9.4%.

Solar modules have the highest likelihood for exemption from tariffs, with most markets allowing duty-free imports. Effects are limited even in markets implementing tariffs. For example, Chinese modules made up 93% of the imports in Indonesia, where they qualify for exemptions.

Importers in South Africa can claim refunds on the 10% solar module duty when the South African Customs Union’s member manufacturers fall short of demand. The company has 0.7 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity, compared to 2.2 GW of new solar generation capacity added in the previous year.

For Li-ion batteries, import tariffs usually range up to 10%. Argentina, India, and Turkey are exceptions to this. Turkey’s 33% tariff on non-EV batteries is the highest. However, the tariffs’ impact is limited as components for most energy storage projects in the country are exempted from import duties.

Imports from China typically face higher tariffs in the U.S., Canada, and the EU. The implementing governments justify these tariffs by invoking the need to protect domestic industries from what they describe as excessive subsidization and unfair trade practices by Chinese firms.

BNEF stated that in the U.S., the Trump administration’s frequent tariff changes have caused sharp swings in solar products and non-EV batteries. Rates have risen under multiple measures over the last nine months.

These measures include the 10% blanket reciprocal tariff introduced on April 5, the higher market-specific reciprocal tariffs implemented on August 6 after repeated delays, and a series of country-specific actions targeting China, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and India since the year’s beginning.

The new measures add to an existing list of tariffs implemented in earlier administrations, starting from 2012, when the first duties were imposed on solar products from China.

The global energy transition is falling behind as the world drifts further from its climate goals, according to Wood Mackenzie’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025–26.

Nairobi (Kenya) - The new Emissions Gap Report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) shows that global climate goals are increasingly slipping out of reach. Despite updated pledges by governments, the path to limiting global warming to 1.5°C appears increasingly unattainable - with serious consequences for the economy, the environment, and society.

According to the UNEP report, the planet is projected to warm by 2.3 to 2.5°C by the end of the century - even with the latest climate plans. Methodological adjustments disguise the lack of real progress. Particularly concerning: many countries are not on track to meet their climate targets. A lack of ambition and concrete action is bringing the world ever closer to breaching the 1.5°C threshold.

Little Progress Despite New Pledges

In its Emissions Gap Report 2025, titled Off Target, UNEP warns that current national climate pledges show little effect. The projected global warming by the end of the century now stands at 2.3 to 2.5°C, compared to 2.6 to 2.8°C last year. If only existing policies were implemented, warming could reach up to 2.8°C.

About 0.1°C of the apparent improvement is due to methodological adjustments - one-third of the total gain - and UNEP notes that the upcoming withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement will offset another 0.1°C. This means that the new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) have made almost no real difference. Countries remain far from the goal of keeping warming “well below 2°C” and ideally limiting it to 1.5°C.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned: “ Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees is now inevitable – starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. And the path to a livable future gets steeper by the day. But this is no reason to surrender.“ He urged nations to dramatically raise their ambitions: “1.5 degrees by the end of the century remains our North Star.”

UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen also criticized the lack of speed: “Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target.” Progress exists, she noted, but it is far too slow: “We still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop.”

Emissions Keep Rising - Geopolitical Challenges Slow Climate Action

By the end of September 2025, only 60 parties to the Paris Agreement - responsible for 63% of global emissions - had submitted or announced new climate targets for 2035. Global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in 2024, reaching about 57.7 gigatonnes of CO? equivalent, an increase of 2.3% over the previous year.

To stay on a 2°C pathway, emissions would need to fall by about 25% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels - and by around 40% or more to keep the 1.5°C target within reach. However, the current national contributions would only achieve about a 15% reduction by 2035 - far below what is required.

A major obstacle remains the geopolitical environment. Conflicts, economic uncertainties, and insufficient financial support for developing countries are hampering progress. The G20 nations, responsible for 77% of global emissions, are particularly under scrutiny: they collectively continue to miss their own targets, with their emissions rising by 0.7% in 2024.

At the same time, the report points to existing solutions: „Proven solutions already exist. From the rapid growth in cheap renewable energy to tackling methane emissions, we know what needs to be done. Now is the time for countries to go all in and invest in their future with ambitious climate action – action that delivers faster economic growth, better human health, more jobs, energy security and resilience,” Andersen emphasized.

Conclusion: The Window of Opportunity Is Closing Fast

The UNEP report paints a clear picture: without immediate and deep emission cuts, the world will overshoot the 1.5°C target by a wide margin. While countermeasures remain technically feasible, the political and economic window is rapidly narrowing.

The report shows that a scenario of “rapid mitigation from 2025 onward” could limit the 1.5°C overshoot to about 0.3°C and enable a return to 1.5°C by 2100. Every fraction of a degree avoided matters - for the stability of the climate as well as for the global economy.

The Office of Climate and Energy and Office of the Environmental Justice Public Advocate in the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) began the program in October 2024 with equitable clean energy nonprofit partners Elevate Energy and the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition.

The original yearlong mission was to support 25 selected community-based organizations (listed below) working for enduring and environmentally just climate action in frontline communities across Michigan. Frontline communities are often historically disadvantaged locations that tend to face the impacts of climate change “first and worst.”

Now, instead of winding down, the Community Accelerator will extend programming for continuing cohort members through 2026 – shaped by feedback from participating organizations and the changing policy and funding landscape for climate and environmental justice work.

The group gathered in Lansing recently to celebrate wins, compare notes, and look ahead. Cheering on their work was Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II.

“This is the room in which there will be brainstorming. This is the room in which we will challenge one another, and we will pull the best ideas out of one another,” Gilchrist said. “What will not change is this administration’s commitment to making progress on environmental justice.”

In its first year, the accelerator provided each cohort member with $25,000 in participation funding, one-on-one technical assistance, peer-to-peer learning, statewide networking, and more. Participants set goals, tapped into resources, and built partnerships across Michigan communities and sectors. Among successful outcomes, cohort members received over $4.5 million total in public and private grant funding. In all, they applied for more than 55 grants to build their organizational capacity and advance their community visions for workforce development, energy efficiency, resilience hubs, agriculture and food justice, and climate action planning.

Projects ranged from electric vehicle ride share infrastructure, food support, energy efficient home development, and youth engagement and training programs.

The new name reflects the state’s ongoing commitment to community-led climate action and environmental justice. Dedication to the Justice40 commitments outlined in the state’s Michigan Healthy Climate Plan (MHCP) continues, ensuring that at least 40% of state funding for climate and water infrastructure benefit Michigan’s historically disadvantaged communities.

Here’s a look at how four cohort organizations have put their accelerator learning to use:

Growing Hope, Inc., Ypsilanti

Executive Director Julius Buzzard said it’s doubtful his organization would have successfully applied for federal funds or met its capital project goals in 2025 without the accelerator.

The organization grows food with and for the community on its 1.5-acre Growing Hope Center and Urban Farm, supplying free produce and inviting people to “get their hands in the dirt” as they build more just and joyful relationships with the food system. It also runs the Ypsilanti Farmers Marketplace and Growing Hope Incubator Kitchen that has supported about 70 entrepreneurs and fledged 15 businesses in four years.

Growing Hope’s $1.2 million budget in 2025 was the largest since its founding in 2003. The group employs about 22 staff, 12 of whom are local teens.

The accelerator and additional investment from private and federal sources helped fund building renovations, an energy audit, and plans to install and upgrade solar power and outfit a second building with a kitchen. A consultant provided coaching to help level up fundraising efforts.

“You have to have money to make money,” Buzzard said. “The capacity that’s required to apply for public dollars is more than somebody could do if they don’t have a team or don’t have any support.”

BASS, Inc. (Building Assets to Strengthen Society), Highland Park

With a name pronounced like ""base,” BASS, Inc., has a core mission of economic development, affordable housing, community engagement and support for youth and young adults ages 7-24 with partner programs My Sister’s Keeper and My Brother’s Keeper.

The accelerator has boosted the reach of BASS’ three-person staff, contractors, and volunteers.

“This cohort has been a phenomenal opportunity for us,” said Program Director Tanesha Windom. “We feel like we’ve been resourced and fueled to carry our projects to completion.”

That includes the group’s three-year Green Revolution youth environmental leadership project, supported by a $500,000 EGLE grant. The three-pronged effort includes workshops, community green spaces, and development of a 5,000-square-foot resilience hub on Woodward Avenue.

The accelerator has helped secure architectural and contracting expertise for a green rooftop meant to mitigate the climate and health impacts of 40,000 vehicles a day traveling on Woodward.

In the year ahead, Windom sees opportunities to give back to the cohort: “as we learn, sharing what we learn.”

Four County Community Foundation (The Hispanic Service Center of Imlay City), Romeo

Since 1987, the foundation has provided more than $14 million in grants and scholarships for food security, public transportation, economic development, and more in Lapeer, St. Clair, Oakland, and Macomb counties.

Executive Director Kathy Dickens said she enjoys bringing communities together around emerging needs. The accelerator and its peer-to-peer sessions have expanded her horizons.

“It has allowed me an opportunity to reflect on the larger network across the state – all of our cohort partners who are doing great work and have envisioned projects that I should probably be considering,” she said. “I’ve gained a lot of insight and connections and partnerships.”

The foundation leveraged its accelerator grant to hire grant-writing consultants and enable at least one new project already.

Dickens said the cohort has done a great job of addressing issues based on community thoughts and needs.

“It’s important to realize the needs that are out there because of human behavior over years, to recognize what our community problems are, how we’ve arrived at that point, how we remedy them, and how we prevent it from happening again,” she said. “I’m able to think bigger, broader, deeper about community problems.”

Friends of Rouge Park, Detroit

The City of Detroit’s century-old Rouge Park covers nearly 1,200 acres with diverse ecosystems and environmental challenges. Luckily, it also has a growing support system of more than 200 Friends of Rouge Park members, plus hundreds of additional volunteers and partners.

“The challenges in the park are many, but the ecological, nature-based solutions also have so much potential,” said Executive Director Lindsay Pielack.

Stewardship Manager Antonio Cosme applied to join the accelerator before Pielack started in January 2025 as part of its new management structure.

Pielack said the accelerator has built capacity as the organization grows in size and budget. Technical assistance dollars helped her attend an intensive accounting workshop in Chicago, and the group conducted its first audit this year.

“I think the real benefit to this program has been the connection with the really wise and accessible staff of the program to help us know what we don’t know and have a really open door to ask the questions,” she said. “It’s not about knowing all the answers.”

While California’s emissions go down, its economy continues to expand. Today, the state released data through the California GHG Emissions Inventory showing a 3% drop in statewide emissions in 2023 — the third-largest annual percentage decrease since tracking began in 2000. The decrease is equivalent to removing more than 2.6 million gasoline-powered cars from California’s roads for one year.

Over the total period since 2000, greenhouse gas emissions in California went down by 21% — even as the state’s economy increased 81% in that same time period. California has reached this progress, despite Republican and industry attacks on the state’s efforts.

The 21% emissions decrease since 2000 is equivalent to removing the annual emissions from 22.9 million cars. The latest data underscores a continued trend of steady emissions decline even as the economy continues to grow.

“The latest data show that science-driven policy and innovation are moving California closer to our climate goals,” said California Environmental Protection Secretary Yana Garcia. “Emissions are down; cleaner trucks are on the road and communities are breathing healthier air. Access to reliable data isn’t just the foundation of progress. It’s how we hold ourselves accountable and make smart choices for the future. As the Trump Administration moves to weaken national emissions reporting, California will continue to lead with transparency, integrity and results.”

California’s climate leadership

California stands as a world leader in addressing the climate crisis. The climate crisis transcends every border and boundary, and does not recognize partisan lines. Extreme weather will continue to threaten lives. California is leading the charge, taking decisive action and creating strong results to help ensure a healthier future for all.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the state continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available — and is the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Recently, California announced record-breaking sales of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV). Consumer demand for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) is surging, even despite federal attempts to derail the Golden State’s pursuit of a 100% clean energy future, with a record 29.1% of all new cars purchased in the third quarter of 2025 were ZEVs.

Highlights from today’s report

Emissions from cars and light-duty pickup trucks reached an all-time low as fossil fuel use continued to fall. This drop occurred despite a 1% increase in vehicle miles travelled. Emissions from the state’s heavy-duty diesel vehicles also declined.

California has decreased the carbon intensity of its economy by 57% since 2000.

The electricity sector had its lowest carbon intensity since 2000. Wind and solar represent over 30 % of generation and in-state solar increased by 8 % from 2022, driven by requirements under the state’s Cap-and-Invest Program (formerly known as Cap-and-Trade) and the Renewables Portfolio Standard.

Industrial sector emissions declined by 5 % due to reductions from refineries, oil and gas extraction, cement manufacturing, cogeneration facilities, and other fossil-fuel use.

Livestock emissions, which are responsible for 71% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions, peaked in 2012 and continued to decline in 2023. The decrease is driven by use of methane digesters at dairies funded by Cap-and-Invest auction money and incentivized by the Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

The residential and commercial sector had a rise in emissions, largely because of an increase in residential fossil gas use which was likely due to a colder winter in 2023.

An early estimate of 2024 data, based primarily on reported and third-party verified data for the state’s largest emitters, shows that emission reductions will continue to trend downward. The 2024 inventory data is not yet final and will not be released until 2026 once all data sources are updated and incorporated.

About the inventory

The statewide inventory relies on data from the Mandatory Reporting Regulation, which counts emissions and reductions from about 80% of California’s sources of human-caused climate emissions. It uses data from other state and local agencies to round out that picture.

The announced plans to end federal monitoring of greenhouse gases will not affect California’s inventory.

Standing up for science, creating strong climate solutions

Illegal federal attempts to derail California’s clean vehicle standards will have some impact on the state’s ability to reduce the negative health and environmental impacts of climate change. But California remains committed to addressing harmful pollution and the impacts of climate change. This includes:

Moving forward on the next round of light-duty vehicle emissions standards for the 2030s and beyond. A workshop was held on October 21.

Amending the state’s Cap-and-Invest Program to help achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. A workshop was held on October 29.

Formalizing rules for carbon management. A nationwide list of carbon capture, utilization, and storage projects was posted last month and rulemaking is expected to be finalized next year.

Updating the Landfill Methane Regulation to reduce emissions from solid waste landfills. The Board will consider adopting the amendments on November 20.

The 16 MW renewable electricity commitment in South Korea directly contributes to the Scope 2 target and reduces reliance on fossil-powered grids.","Merck agrees a new 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with South Korean energy supplier SK Innovation E&S, marking its longest renewable electricity contract in the Asia-Pacific region.

The agreement delivers 16 megawatts of clean energy capacity to power operations at Merck’s life science manufacturing facilities in Daejeon and Songdo, South Korea.

The deal secures approximately 21,000 megawatt-hours of renewable electricity each year starting from December 2027. That covers about three-quarters of the electricity used across Merck’s South Korea life science sites.

""This agreement reflects our long-term commitment to manufacturing sustainability,"" says Tim Jaeger, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer for Merck's Life Science business.

""By adding renewable electricity to the grid for our operations in South Korea, we are taking further measures to reduce our environmental impact and enabling our customers do the same.""

The contract builds on Merck’s global renewable energy strategy, which includes virtual PPAs in Europe and North America as well as on-site installations across its facilities worldwide. For South Korea, this agreement does more than offset emissions – it adds capacity directly to the local electricity grid.

How PPAs reshape supply chains

A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a fixed-term contract between a power provider and a customer that sets a price and guarantees a long-term supply of electricity. PPAs are often used to fund renewable energy projects and allow companies to buy energy directly from clean sources without developing their own generation facilities.

Merck’s deal with SK Innovation E&S represents a physical PPA, where the renewable energy physically reaches the regional grid. This stands apart from virtual PPAs, where companies purchase renewable energy certificates without drawing actual power from the source.

The key advantage of Merck’s model in South Korea is ""additionality"" – meaning the project adds new renewable capacity to the grid rather than just shifting existing clean energy from one buyer to another.

By taking this route, Merck aligns its procurement strategy with growing industry expectations around value chain responsibility. Sourcing renewable electricity directly connected to the grid enhances transparency, supports local infrastructure and improves the environmental integrity of supply chain operations.

With a target of fully integrating sustainability into its value chains by 2030, Merck is applying pressure not just internally but also across suppliers and partners. This includes expectations around energy sourcing, product design and packaging. For example, the company aims to cut packaging weight by 10% per unit of sales and commits to circularity principles in all new packaging designs.

Beyond packaging, Merck is also pushing its suppliers to lower emissions through Scope 3 accountability. Merck targets a 30% cut in Scope 3 emissions by 2030 based on 2020 levels.

However, while Scope 1 and 2 emissions (direct operations and purchased electricity) show a 43% drop so far, Scope 3 progress remains slow, down just 2%.

Targeting 2030 climate goals through procurement

Merck’s South Korea PPA supports its broader 2030 target of sourcing 80% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources.

The firm sets that benchmark as part of a wider climate framework introduced in 2020 and aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The strategy includes three headline commitments: improving lives through sustainable science, embedding sustainability in all value chains and achieving climate neutrality by 2040.

As part of this, Merck also aims to halve its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and cut Scope 3 by 30% by the end of the decade. The 16 MW renewable electricity commitment in South Korea directly contributes to the Scope 2 target and reduces reliance on fossil-powered grids.

Energy procurement plays a central role in Merck’s climate approach, but it's only one part of a larger sustainability toolkit. Through its SHAPE framework and the DOZN green chemistry tool, Merck also evaluates the environmental profile of its chemicals and products.

By 2030, it wants 10% of its portfolio to qualify as ""Greener Alternative Products"".

SK Innovation E&S brings the infrastructure and technical expertise to realise this project in South Korea, while Merck leverages the deal to strengthen its regional supply chain sustainability credentials.

With €21.2bn (US$24.4bn) in global revenue across 65 countries and more than 62,000 staff, Merck’s operational footprint spans life sciences, electronics and healthcare.

Moves like this South Korea PPA show how energy sourcing decisions connect directly to its supply chain strategy – both in reducing carbon and in demonstrating leadership on procurement standards.

By tying electricity supply to physical generation in the region, Merck secures a stable, clean energy flow for its operations and lays the groundwork for future supply chain transparency. The result is a more robust and measurable approach to climate targets and a model other multinationals may follow.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/025de102bcf1626d8d953541ca991d55:d863549405f2ed962fdc753512285fef/merck-s-deal-with-sk-innovation-e-s-will-secure-75-of-the-german-firm-s-energy-needs-in-south-korea-for-the-next-10-years.png.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 04:57:31.872986

Clean Energy Fuels Corp. sold 61.3 million gallons of renewable natural gas (RNG) during the third quarter, up 3% when compared to the same period of last year, according to information released by the company on Nov. 4.

During an earnings call, Clean Energy President and CEO Andrew Littlefair reported that the company’s two largest dairy projects—one in Texas and one in Idaho—have recently begun initial operations. With those two projects now online, Clean Energy has eight projects in operation.

The company also broke ground on three additional RNG projects during the third quarter under its joint development agreement with Maas Energy Works. The three projects span six dairies located in South Dakota, Florida and New Mexico. Once fully operational, the plants are expected to produce approximately 3 million gallons of RNG annually.

While renewable identification number (RIN) prices under the Renewable Fuel Standard have stabilized, Littlefair noted California Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit prices continue to have some headwinds that are impacting profitability of the company’s RNG segment. LCFS program changes, however, are expected to tighten the market and support gradual price improvement in 2026 and beyond, he added.

In the lead-up to the 2022 election, the $2.5 million commitment for a renewable energy training centre at TAFE was one of my key election commitments, along with the $10 million commitment for the Energy Future Skills Centre at the University of Wollongong.

But even I could not have envisaged just how amazing these classrooms and mobile vans would turn out.

And I want to say a very big thank you to Andrew Martin from TAFE and to Ty Christopher from the University of Wollongong for the thought and the design and just the ingenuity that has gone into these mobile training centers.

It is so vital for our local workers to have access to the skills and training that they need for the clean energy jobs of the next generation. And I really want to thank our third-year apprentices for coming along today to be part of this exciting announcement.

And with that, I'll hand over to Minister Giles.

ANDREW GILES, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Alison. It's really great to be here. It's a pretty amazing thing to have four ministers standing here.

So, I'm really pleased to be here with Paul, with Ryan, and of course with Steve, who I work with incredibly closely in our partnership between the Albanese Labor Government federally and the Minns Labor Government here in New South Wales, to make sure that every person in every corner of New South Wales has every opportunity to get skills they want to do the jobs we need.

And when I think about the jobs that we need, I think about the electrical workforce where we know we need tens of thousands more sparkies right now.

And today, this commitment, which really is all about the initiative [indistinct] incredible but now shy local federal member, Alison Byrnes, something that you fought for to ensure that more people can get the same opportunity for a fantastic career contribution, just like these electrical apprentices we've been talking to today.

I've got to say that the facilities here are amazing, this container behind us and the two trucks over there.

It's one thing to read about a proposal on a bit of paper; quite another to see it physically.

And to think about the impact this is going to have on both the training journey, but also inspiring more people, more young people and more people thinking about upskilling and reskilling to be part of the clean energy opportunities.

There's been a lot of talk about net zero in the Commonwealth Parliament over the last two weeks. A lot of talk in the Liberal Party room as they talk about themselves.

What is clear though is that they've got very little to say to the Australian people, net zero ideas when it comes to skills and training.

But today is all about a really significant investment, here in Wollongong but right around regional New South Wales, to bring training to where people are.

Not to expect people to come to the facilities, but to reach out, to break down every single barrier that's holding people back from fulfilling their potential and making a really big contribution.

Every day that I get up, I try and play a role in achieving just those goals for individuals and for our economy, and I'm really proud to be able to do that work in partnership with my friend, Steve Whan.

STEVE WHAN, NSW MINISTER FOR SKILLS, TAFE AND TERTIARY EDUCATION: Thanks, Andrew. And it is great to be here with everybody today. I want to really thank the Federal Government, Alison and Andrew and the Federal Government, for the funding that's helped us to get these.

We've got some very active local members here who pushed us to get a manufacturing centre of excellence here in Wollongong and to work with the University on projects like this.

This is important for a couple of reasons. Regardless of the political debate going on that Minister Giles was just talking about, we're already out there building the power lines, building the solar farms, building the wind farms to actually take us to net zero.

That work's happening, but it's only happening if we can actually supply the workforce. And what these mobile units are doing for us is two things.

Firstly, they're helping us to get out into the high schools and to the people who might be the potential workers of the future to let them know the exciting opportunities that are there, the sort of opportunities that our apprentices who've joined us today are seeing.

And then, they also help us with the mobile training units to go to locations where we may not have that infrastructure on the ground to actually help us with the training. So, it's really important to be able to do that.

One of the units will be operating here in the Illawarra. It’s started here. One's going to head off to Tamworth and help us in the Central West as well. So that's a really important part of helping communities to see the benefit that the REZs can bring to them, local jobs that help us to reach net zero.

And I'm really proud of the role that TAFE plays in this, in delivering these services. Really thankful for the role that Wollongong University’s played and really importantly, the Federal Government's played in funding it.

So, thanks everyone, and great to be here to see the product of your election commitment actually roll out the door. It's great.

Climate change has upended the progress achieved by recent regulations, Tighe said.
After six months, the group outlined certain areas for research and subsequently applied for funding through the Duke Endowment.
Climate and health is one of the Climate Commitment’s focus areas for research which inspired CHeRI’s creation, explained Toddi Steelman, vice president and vice provost for climate and sustainability.
“Climate change is sort of the mother of all collective action problems,” Steelman said.","The Duke Endowment recently awarded Duke’s interdisciplinary Climate and Health Research Initiative (CHeRI) $4.5 million to fund research at the intersection of climate change and health.

CHeRI — a collaboration between the School of Medicine, Global Health Institute, Nicholas School of the Environment, and the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability — plans to use the funding for the next four years to support new and existing research initiatives. The health-climate relationship, Robert Tighe, director of CHeRI and associate professor of medicine, said is not an area that many researchers are actively investigating.

“It does require some effort to get people to start to think about how they might be impactful in this space,” he said.

A significant amount of the new funding will go toward CHeRI’s annual “Big Idea” symposiums beginning in January. At these symposiums, faculty and graduate students will present ideas for research and compete for funding based on set criteria. Unlike other research symposiums, participants will present proposals for ideas without a set research team or plan.

“It’s a little reverse from what we would normally do because it's really just: ‘What's your idea? What's your concept? What's the thing you want to study?’” Tighe said. “Then we'll sort of figure out the team that can help support you and help to flesh out the idea.”

The new funding also allows CHeRI to support existing research projects including investigating how fungal growth, spores and toxins, in the wake of Hurricane Helene, are impacting human health in western North Carolina as well as studying how wildfire smoke affects immune response.

Tighe became particularly interested in the intersection of climate change and health after witnessing how rising temperatures and increased exposure to air pollution impacted the prevalence of lung disease in patients. Climate change has upended the progress achieved by recent regulations, Tighe said.

CHeRI’s roots trace back to March 2024 after Mary Klotman, executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine, tasked Tighe with leading a strategic working group to identify research topics focusing on climate change and health as part of the University’s broader Climate Commitment. After six months, the group outlined certain areas for research and subsequently applied for funding through the Duke Endowment.

Climate and health is one of the Climate Commitment’s focus areas for research which inspired CHeRI’s creation, explained Toddi Steelman, vice president and vice provost for climate and sustainability.

“As the world warms, all of us will be affected by rising temperatures and that gets down to basic biology and physiology of heat in how we react as humans,” Steelman said, adding that climate change could cause health problems like fungal infections, kidney failure, mosquito-borne diseases.

Researchers expect some communities will be more adversely impacted than others. The funding announcement specifically mentioned that the grant will go toward “identifying the groups most vulnerable to climate and health impacts in North Carolina and South Carolina,” particularly individuals living in low-income or rural communities. Steelman emphasized this focus is in line with the Climate Commitment.

“We know that the most vulnerable in our society, whether that's here in the United States or globally, will be more severely affected by a changing climate because there are fewer resources to mitigate the risks that vulnerable populations will face,” Steelman said.

For both Steelman and Tighe, it was important that CHeRI was an interdisciplinary initiative to ensure that faculty and students involved in both health and environmental studies could combine their knowledge to conduct effective research.

“Climate change is sort of the mother of all collective action problems,” Steelman said. “… There's a whole variety of disciplines that I think naturally start to coalesce if you are focused on real-world problems related to climate change and health.”

Tighe hopes that CHeRI’s interdisciplinary approach will ensure that researchers can quickly identify climate and health-related problems and discover solutions given the urgency of climate change.

“We don't have 30 or 40 years to sort of go down the normal process of discovery that eventually leads to something. These are things that are happening right now,” he said.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dtc/038a7c5f-15ef-4157-a273-921c98452908.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&ar=16%3A9&crop=faces%2Cedges,N,,2025-11-07 01:04:31.168776

Given this lack of progress, we need a better way to actually begin this needed transition from fuel taxes to mileage-based user fees.
Drivers also view mileage fees as double taxation or a new tax that they’d pay in addition to the current fuel tax.
Cost of collection: The cost of collecting fuel taxes for personal vehicles is about 2% of the revenue collected.
Reason Foundation has recommended this as the best way to jump-start the transition from per-gallon fuel taxes to per-mile charges.","Most transportation professionals are convinced that paying for America’s highways through per-gallon fuel taxes is no longer sustainable. While the transition to electric vehicles has slowed somewhat, hybrids increasingly contribute to lower fuel-tax revenues, and federal new-car fuel efficiency requirements are now the largest factor in projected decreases in gas-tax revenues.

Over the past nine years, Congress has funded a growing number of state mileage-based user fee (MBUF) pilot projects, which have had generally positive receptions from the very small fraction of a state population that participated. But state and federal elected officials are all over the map on how to replace fuel taxes, with some calling for a new federal vehicle registration fee and others wanting electric vehicles to pay twice as much per mile as petroleum-fueled vehicles pay today.

In the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Congress authorized a national road user charge (RUC) pilot project that would charge real fees. It asked the Biden administration to appoint a steering committee to design and oversee that program. The Biden White House dithered but eventually appointed that committee last year, but failed to announce the members. It has not convened, and so it has not defined the national pilot project. The Trump White House has said or done nothing about it. So there will be no results from a non-existing national pilot project to provide lessons learned for next year’s surface transportation reauthorization bill, as originally intended.

Given this lack of progress, we need a better way to actually begin this needed transition from fuel taxes to mileage-based user fees. That requires figuring out a workable approach for large-scale per-mile charges, including the rates to be charged to various types of vehicles, as well as affordable technologies.

However, to win political and popular support, transportation policymakers must also address the very real concerns of motorists, truckers, and elected officials. The most important concerns and issues about mileage fees are:

Privacy: People fear the government—“Big Brother in your car”—tracking everywhere they go.

Drivers also view mileage fees as double taxation or a new tax that they’d pay in addition to the current fuel tax.

Transportation officials are concerned about the high cost of collection compared to the gas tax.

Several years ago, I suggested that instead of beginning with some type of vehicle (e.g., EVs), we should begin with one type of roadway. My suggestion is to begin this transition with Interstates and other limited-access highways, using all-electronic tolling. This first step would address all three of the above concerns.

Privacy: The only miles recorded would be from on-ramp to off-ramp, so there would be no data suggesting the trip purpose. Millions of people drive on tolled Interstates and turnpikes today, and the electronic tolling does not seem to raise privacy concerns.

New tax: The answer to concerns about double taxation is to provide refunds of the fuel tax paid for the miles traveled on the newly priced highways. That’s a simple calculation that both the Massachusetts Turnpike and the New York Thruway have been doing for many years for truck fleets using those toll roads.

Cost of collection: The cost of collecting fuel taxes for personal vehicles is about 2% of the revenue collected. With all-electronic tolling, the cost is as low as 5% of the revenue. By contrast, consulting firm WSP last year estimated the cost of collection for scaling up technology used in recent state mileage fee pilot projects as between $4 and $9 a month per vehicle. That is clearly not ready for prime time. So we should start where it is feasible to use relatively inexpensive all-electronic tolling.

Starting the transition to per-mile charges with limited-access highways should not be mandated by Congress. But it should be allowed by Congress in the 2026 reauthorization. Reason Foundation has recommended this as the best way to jump-start the transition from per-gallon fuel taxes to per-mile charges. If all U.S. limited-access highways were converted, that would be more than one-third of all vehicle miles of travel.

The bill should make use of an existing but never-used federal program: the Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program (ISRRPP). Instead of being open to only three states, the program should be open to all 50 states. And instead of allowing a participating state to convert only one Interstate, it should be able to convert any or all of them.

Potentially more controversial, but crucially important, is refunding fuel taxes for the miles driven on newly priced highways, to avoid double taxation. This is actually a good deal for state transportation departments because the rate charged on tolled Interstates is typically at least twice as much per mile as what is paid in fuel tax for driving the same highway. That’s because the toll rate must cover the capital and operating costs of the more costly limited-access highway. The state DOT would be freed from devoting any of its fuel tax money to those expensive Interstates, so those dollars would be available to do a better job of sustaining and improving state highways. (I crunched the numbers on this in a peer-reviewed paper in the Transportation Research Board’s journal, Transportation Research Record, in 2023.) A similar proposition is potentially true for federal fuel taxes, whose proceeds would no longer be needed for Interstates that transitioned to per-mile charges.

While this program would begin as a pilot test of the concept, there is good reason to expect several states to volunteer as early adopters. Over the last decade or so, the following states have commissioned detailed studies of the feasibility of converting some or all of their Interstates to toll financing: Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In addition, four states took part in a federally funded Corridors of the Future study that would have allowed rebuilding I-70 with toll financing and dedicated truck lanes (Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio). After participating in two of these studies, Indiana this year became the first state to pass legislation for converting its Interstates to toll financing.

The first few states to take part in this mileage fee program will serve as role models for others, just as California, Florida, and Virginia have done for express toll lanes. Over the next decade or two, as states transition their limited-access highways to per-mile charging, the tech industry may develop low-cost, privacy-respecting technology for per-mile charges on all other types of roadways. And that would be the beginning of converting the other two-thirds of vehicle miles traveled to paying by the mile, rather than by the gallon.",https://a8d50b36.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/dreamstime_xl_389505521-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 01:04:38.684038
