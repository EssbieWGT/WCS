On Thursday, 37 of the Michigan House of Representatives’ 52 Democratic members brought a resolution urging U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to stop issuing extensions for the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in West Olive.

Wright first issued an extension on the plant’s operations in May, eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, citing the Trump administration’s executive order declaring an energy emergency and arguing the plant’s capacity was needed to meet peak energy demand across the Midwest over the summer and preventing blackouts.

The plan to shut down the plant was not a snap decision from its owner, Consumers Energy, which announced in 2021 that it intended to go coal-free by 2025.

Michigan’s energy regulator, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the company’s shut down plan after weighing input from the Department of Attorney General, environmental and consumer advocates, energy developers, businesses and more, determining Consumers Energy’s plan to retire the plant and shift to other resources was “the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting Consumers’ energy and capacity needs.”

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which operates the electric grid for much of the central U.S., also signed off on the shutdown, after determining that it would not violate their reliability criteria.

In their resolution, Michigan Democrats pointed to the grid operator’s projections that it had plenty of energy supply to meet expected consumer demand over the summer, while noting the government order conflicts with Consumers’ decision to cease using coal as an energy source.

They also cited the continued costs to ratepayers for operating the plant, in addition to the toll the plant is taking on the environment as well as the health of residents living near the plant.

“The plant releases millions of pounds of air pollutants annually, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter. Nearly 9 million tons of climate-harming carbon dioxide are also released annually,” the resolution reads. “The air pollution generated by coal plants has been linked to several negative health impacts such as asthma, cancer, heart conditions, and lung conditions.”

The resolution is unlikely to move forward, as the Republican-led House is not scheduled to meet to vote on policy this week, and the resolution was referred to the Government Operations Committee – generally considered a graveyard for policy.

However, Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids), one of the resolution’s sponsors, said the Trump administration’s decision to continue ignoring calls to shutdown the plant prompted more formal action.

The Trump Administration is testing American institutions to the bone, Wooden said, arguing that in order to place the country on the right trajectory, Trump’s opponents need to leverage any and all available methods to push back, whether it’s supporting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s legal action against the administration’s orders or highlighting the impacts of Trump’s policies.

“Allowing [the plant] to shut down is in line with our own private industry, with our own utilities, and with the environmental community,” Wooden said. “And you know, even if this doesn’t pass, I think it’s important we can remain clear that this is a damaging decision and it is time for the Trump administration to listen to Michiganders who … don’t want to see more utility price hikes and don’t want dirty coal polluting our airways.”

Bentley Johnson, the federal government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, told the Michigan Advance that the Trump Administration’s decision to extend the Campbell plant’s operations cuts utilities and regulators’ planning process at the knees, while creating questions for what this means for the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

He also pointed to testimony presented by a host of separate environmental organizations in opposition to the second extension, which found that during the tightest energy margin of the summer, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator had an energy surplus equal to more than 10 times the amount of energy produced at the Campbell plant.

While Consumers Energy has reported $80 million in costs in keeping the plant open between May 23 and Sept. 30, Johnson noted that this number does not account for the $84 million in costs recovered by selling power to the grid operator.

“If we had to eat all those costs, that’s a lot. But instead, we’re raising the rates in these other states, you know. Rate payers in other states are helping us pay for this,” Johnson said.

Breaking down the cost of continuing to operate the plant during that period comes out to $615,384 per day, Johnson said.

“No one was asking for this, you know, no one wanted this,” Johnson said.

Affordability is the issue of the day, particularly with electric bills, Johnson said. The first step in addressing that issue?

“Don’t make it worse,” Johnson said before noting that it’s not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course.

However, if the extensions continue, Johnson argued Consumers Energy has a duty to their ratepayers to step in and say “this is not right.”

The Arizona-based company plans to invest approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to begin commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is expected to create more than 600 new jobs with an average annual manufacturing salary of $74,000, which is approximately twice Cherokee County’s per capita income.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025, played a role in First Solar’s decision to expand in South Carolina. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” explained Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. First Solar, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the U.S. by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster. “First Solar’s investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America’s energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

Having manufactured in the U.S. since 2002, First Solar is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the U.S. By 2027, the company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

DartPoints’ $125M Investment Will Boost Data Center Capacity

DartPoints, a regional provider of colocation, cloud, and interconnection solutions, plans to invest $125 million to expand its Greenville County, SC data center. The project will create 10 jobs.

“This project builds on DartPoints’ collaboration with state and local partners to expand access to critical IT power in high-growth regions,” commented DartPoints President and CEO Scott Willis. “Greenville has been a part of our platform for nearly two decades. This investment reflects our confidence in the region’s talent and business environment. We’re building capacity for the kinds of workloads, including AI, research and data analytics, that are shaping how organizations operate today.”

The data center’s total capacity will increase from 2.5 megawatts to 12.5 megawatts, adding 88,000 square feet of high-density space engineered for artificial intelligence (AI), enterprise, and edge applications. This expansion will provide critical infrastructure for regional enterprises and universities that depend on high-performance computing, research, and analytics to power AI-driven innovation. By locating capacity closer to where data is created and consumed, DartPoints will be able to help organizations operate with greater speed, efficiency, and resilience.

DartPoints’ facilities are developed with a mix of air and liquid cooling options to meet performance needs while managing energy use responsibly. The company’s approach focuses on supporting communities that want to attract technology growth while maintaining reliable, energy-efficient operations.

Construction is underway, and operations are expected to begin in July 2027.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators.
In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.
The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August.
That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where","Louisiana and the federal government are pushing for more than $1 billion in fines and penalties against Smitty’s Supply Inc. for years of environmental violations and more recent damages from an explosion and petrochemical spill at its Tangipahoa Parish plant.

That dollar figure is eye-catching but also leads one to question: Why did it take an environmental disaster for officials to finally act against a business with an established track record of wiping its feet on regulations meant to curb pollution?

The answer: It’s in line with regulators’ kid-glove approach to environmental enforcement in Louisiana, where state and federal agencies go out of their way to provide a welcome mat for industry while placing the welfare of its residents on the backburner.

Examples of this practice are actually detailed in a lawsuit the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have filed against Smitty’s Supply. It accuses the company of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations.

Their complaint cites hundreds of infractions going back nearly five years, culminating with the Aug. 22 disaster at its Roseland facility. Millions of gallons of oil, lubricants and automotive fluids made their way into the nearby Tangipahoa River and flowed several miles downstream. A fire that took two weeks to fully extinguish created an oily soot that covered nearby homes, farms and businesses.

Before that, the company was cited for illegal wastewater discharges, failing to report pollution and seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that went beyond the facility’s property and contaminated public areas.

Between May 2022 and August 2025, Smitty’s Supply reported that it exceeded limits 230 times for the amount of organic material, fecal coliform, carbon and other pollutants it’s allowed to discharge in its wastewater.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators. What’s gone unreported?

According to the lawsuit, the company failed to conduct “daily visual observations” of five outfall canals to check for possible pollutants on weekends and holidays from May 2022 through at least April 2025. A bit of quick math indicates that equals about 350 days without required surveillance. And because these inspections weren’t performed, they couldn’t be logged, which led to additional violations.

Then there are the infractions found when LDEQ inspectors made site visits. In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.

After the August explosion, regulators determined the company failed to develop a required Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan and didn’t adequately maintain a Facility Response Plan that lays out how it handles such incidents.

All this is to say there is an extensive history of the company failing to take significant steps to address its pattern of violations and minimal evidence of regulators taking meaningful enforcement action to bring about improvements.

The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August. The company paid $250,000 to settle a state complaint over an oil spill in 2021, and the EPA collected $194,772 in 2019 for infractions, WWL-TV reported.

It’s hard to determine what kind of dent these penalties have made in the private company’s bottom line; it doesn’t have to make its revenue and net income public. But on its website, Smitty’s describes itself as “one of the leading manufacturers in the world of lubricants and related products.” It leads you to believe that Smitty’s Supply has had the wherewithal to prevent its many regulatory fumbles over the years, acknowledged and otherwise.

Like Charles Dickens wrote (and Elvis Costello later sang), accidents will happen. But they’re more probable — and maybe less likely to be considered accidents — in a state where officials aren’t willing to take meaningful punitive action to prevent them.

That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Smittys-explosion-TPSO.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 18:01:41.853997

Plug reported that the growth was driven by higher hydrogen fuel sales, stronger demand across its electrolyzer portfolio, and pricing enhancements.
During the quarter, Plug advanced several large-scale electrolyzer projects, expanding its global footprint.
Plug continues to prioritize material handling, electrolyzers, and hydrogen fuel businesses while streamlining investments toward mid-term markets, such as stationary power and mobility.
In the second quarter, Plug Power reported a revenue of $174 million, up 21% from $143 million in the same period the previous year.","Hydrogen fuel cell solutions provider Plug Power’s revenue went up by 1.89% year-over-year (YoY) to $177 million in the third quarter (Q3) of the financial year 2025, from $173.7 million.

The company attributed the increase to gains in electrolyzer sales, volume growth in hydrogen fuel sales, and price improvements across operating segments.

Net loss for the quarter rose 72% to $363.5 million from $211.1 million last year.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) improved to a loss of $0.12 from a loss of $0.23 last year.

Operating expenses for Q3 rose sharply to $228.6 million from $116.1 million last year. The increase was driven by impairment charges of $97.5 million, compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year, and restructuring expenses of $5.5 million, compared to $0.5 million in 2024.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $110.6 million from $91.6 million, while research and development expenses decreased to $16.1 million from $19.7 million in the prior year. Consequently, the operating loss widened to $348.8 million from $216.1 million in 2024.

Incoming CEO Jose Luis Crespo stated, “This was a strong quarter that demonstrates Plug’s global growth and commercial traction. Our revenue performance reflects accelerating customer adoption and sets a solid foundation to meet our year-end goals as we continue driving the hydrogen economy forward.”

Financing activities contributed $313 million in cash inflows, compared to $779 million in the prior year period. Plug’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $849 million at the end of the nine-month period, compared to $1 billion as of September 2024.

Jose Luis Crespo, who also serves as President and Chief Revenue Officer, emphasized that the company is on track for a record year in electrolyzer sales, with $124 million in revenue recorded year-to-date—up 33% year-over-year—and an expected total of around $200 million by year-end.

“We continue to see big opportunities for green hydrogen, particularly in replacing gray hydrogen in refineries like Galp and BP and in producing e-fuels such as e-methanol, synthetic jet fuel, and ammonia,” Crespo said.

He added that with policy clarity improving in Europe and sustained government support in Australia, the company expects increased adoption of green hydrogen across industrial sectors.

He highlighted that Plug’s $8 billion electrolyzer project pipeline remains highly active, with strong prospects for final investment decisions across key markets, particularly Europe and Australia.

Business Highlights

During the quarter, Plug advanced several large-scale electrolyzer projects, expanding its global footprint. The company reported that over 230 MW of GenEco electrolyzer projects are now being mobilized across Europe, Australia, and North America.

Plug also delivered the first 10 MW GenEco PEM electrolyzer to Galp Energia’s Sines project in Portugal, part of a planned 100 MW installation. The company said it is also advancing multiple multi-megawatt projects across its global markets, representing over 8 GW of opportunity.

In hydrogen fuel production, Plug’s Georgia Green Hydrogen Plant achieved a record output in August, producing 324 tons of liquid hydrogen, with 97% uptime and 99.7% availability.

Plug extended a multi-year hydrogen supply contract with a key domestic partner, securing supply reliability through 2030 and supporting improvements in cost and cash flow.

The company’s hydrogen production network includes 15 TPD live capacity each in Georgia and Louisiana, 10 TPD in Tennessee, and an additional 45 TPD expected from Texas. It had a record production at its Georgia green hydrogen plant in August, achieving 324 tons with 97% uptime and 99.7% availability.

Outlook

The company reaffirmed its strategic roadmap, laid out under Project Quantum Leap, which aims to achieve gross-margin neutrality by the end of 2025, EBITDA positivity in 2026, operating income positivity in 2027, and full profitability in 2028.

Plug continues to prioritize material handling, electrolyzers, and hydrogen fuel businesses while streamlining investments toward mid-term markets, such as stationary power and mobility.

Management noted improving policy support in the U.S., Europe, and Australia, including production tax credits, RED III mandates, and national-level hydrogen subsidies.

In the second quarter, Plug Power reported a revenue of $174 million, up 21% from $143 million in the same period the previous year.

The company posted a revenue of $133.67 million in the first quarter of 2025, an 11% YoY increase from $120.26 million.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Standard-Mercom-32.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 18:00:54.087672

That case is still being litigated, but the attorneys general allege the California law seeks to step in and do the same thing the states objected to at the federal level.
The brief alleges the California laws are illegal because they compel speech from these companies on a topic they may want to avoid speaking on.
Bird said in a news release Monday about the amici curiae that “California needs to stay in California.” “California has no right to tell Iowa or any other state what to do,” Bird said in the release.
The parties involved requested, Nov. 10, an emergency injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the California laws, which are set to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.","Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and attorneys general from 24 additional states are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay on California emissions reporting laws.

The states allege, in the amici curiae filed, the California laws would impose an “illegal greenhouse gas disclosure policy” and would cause “nightmarish compliance costs and liability on companies across the country.”

In 2023, California enacted laws that require businesses of a certain size to submit greenhouse gas emissions reports and reports on the measures the business planned to adopt to reduce their climate-related financial risk.

The brief from the states said California is “trying to be the national regulator of American greenhouse gas emissions—but for many reasons it may not do so.”

The State of Iowa and several other states that also signed onto Bird’s brief, have already sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a similar law that sought to impose emissions reporting standards. That case is still being litigated, but the attorneys general allege the California law seeks to step in and do the same thing the states objected to at the federal level.

The brief said the California law, which would impact businesses outside of the state with revenues above a certain level, requires businesses to express a “certain viewpoint on the highly controversial issue area of climate change.”

It said even if a business believes the climate-related “doomsday scenarios” are unlikely, it has to submit reports about how it plans to respond to the effects of a changing climate.

The brief alleges the California laws are illegal because they compel speech from these companies on a topic they may want to avoid speaking on.

It also alleges the laws would impose “irreparable economic harm on other states.” The brief estimates out-of-state businesses would incur “millions” in auditing and reporting costs for emissions that are outside of California’s borders.

Businesses with more than $1 billion in annual revenue that do business in California are required by the law to disclose “comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions” along their supply chains. Business with $500 million in annual revenue that do business in the state will have to supply biennial climate-related financial risk reports that are publicly available.

California’s enacted Senate Bill 261 says climate change is affecting California communities and economy with wildfires, sea level rise, extreme droughts and extreme weather events.

“Failure of economic actors to adequately plan for and adapt to climate-related risks to their businesses and to the economy will result in significant harm to California,” the law reads.

According to the California statute, mandatory disclosures set by law will help to “ensure a sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future” for the state.

Bird said in a news release Monday about the amici curiae that “California needs to stay in California.”

“California has no right to tell Iowa or any other state what to do,” Bird said in the release. “Their attempt to continually tell other states and businesses how to do business outside California is radical overreach and needs to be stopped.”

Pam Mackey-Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s director, said in a statement that Iowa families are “suffering the real consequences of corporations burning fossil fuels for profit” and cited derechos, droughts and rising insurance costs as an example.

“Climate change is real, and consumers should be able to make informed decisions about whether they prefer supporting companies that are reducing greenhouse gas emissions versus those that are not,” Mackey-Taylor said. “Here in Iowa, we expect our attorney general to serve as the lawyer of the people and take up the everyday issues that affect Iowans, not fight the policies that help protect us.”

The attorneys’ brief is in support of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America’s suit against the chair of the California Air Resources Board. The parties involved requested, Nov. 10, an emergency injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the California laws, which are set to go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.

Everllence will supply the heat pump, while DCO Energy will manage installation and plant upgrades.
The project delivers multiple benefits, including giving customers access to carbon-free thermal energy and the Charles River ecosystem seeing reduced thermal impact.
“Vicinity’s heat pump installation is a smart investment—it reduces emissions without compromising performance, and it’s built to operate efficiently over the long term.","In Greater Boston, demolition is underway to make room for the installation of a 35MW river-based industrial heat pump at Vicinity Energy’s Kendall Square facility. Vicinity has also formed a new agreement with DCO Energy to install the heat pump. This is a major step in Vicinity’s electrification strategy for Boston and Cambridge, which will enable carbon-free steam generation for more than 70 million square feet of building space. The new heat pump is scheduled for installation by 2028.

A significant portion of the heat pump’s capacity is already secured through long-term contracts with medical and educational institutions, reflecting strong market demand for decarbonized energy solutions. Everllence will supply the heat pump, while DCO Energy will manage installation and plant upgrades.

As the baseload generator for Vicinity’s electrification plans, the project will be the first to use the Charles River as a renewable resource for carbon-free steam. Vicinity also plans to add thermal storage technologies for on-demand eSteam™ production from renewable electricity. The project delivers multiple benefits, including giving customers access to carbon-free thermal energy and the Charles River ecosystem seeing reduced thermal impact.

“Execution of this project makes Vicinity’s vision of decarbonizing cities at scale a reality,” said Kevin Hagerty, CEO at Vicinity Energy. “Powered by renewable electricity to safely and efficiently harvest energy from the Charles River, this represents rapid advancement in electrification for U.S. district energy systems, demonstrating how proven heat pump technology can be deployed at scale to decarbonize cities. It enables immediate, scalable carbon reductions without the need for costly and time-intensive new electrical infrastructure in Greater Boston. We are establishing the blueprint of how to decarbonize a U.S. city and will be installing similar innovative electrification technologies at our district energy systems across 12 U.S. cities.”

The proposal to build a river-source heat pump complex at Vicinity’s Kendall facility relies on the Charles River’s thermal energy, an untapped renewable energy resource.

Previously, Vicinity installed a new 42MW electric boiler at its Kendall facility, which provides carbon-free thermal energy to its Boston partners through the established 29-miles of steam piping that runs underneath the city — the Boston and Cambridge district energy system. eSteam™ customers currently include IQHQ and Emerson College. By adopting eSteam™, these institutions are not only advancing their sustainability goals but also positioning themselves to comply with local requirements such as BERDO and BEUDO, while aligning with Massachusetts’ Stretch Energy Code.

“Our priority is delivering reliable, practical solutions that make economic sense,” said Gary Fromer, CEO at DCO Energy. “Vicinity’s heat pump installation is a smart investment—it reduces emissions without compromising performance, and it’s built to operate efficiently over the long term. It’s a real-world step toward sustainability that works for today and the future. This collaboration builds upon the recent success of our joint projects in Philadelphia, further strengthening our track record of delivering innovative, sustainable energy solutions together.”

Building on the blueprint established in Boston and Cambridge, Vicinity is applying lessons learned to guide decarbonization plans in other cities. Progress is already underway in Grand Rapids, where installation of a 9MW electric boiler has begun, marking the city’s first step toward electrification.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/adobestock_82066413.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:18.334356

The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was updated in 2016 to reduce exposures to harmful chemicals linked to chronic diseases like cancer. The law is working, and that’s why the chemical lobby wants to change it now and make it weaker.

The law puts health before corporate profits and has resulted in bans on chemicals like the deadly solvents trichloroethylene (TCE) and methylene chloride. This means less profit from dangerous chemicals.

It also works because states can protect the health of their communities by banning chemicals like PFAS. States are spending billions of taxpayer dollars to clean up PFAS once it’s in the environment—the only solution is prevention.

Boulder, CO — November 17, 2025

With cooling demand set to grow 2.5-fold by 2050, Third Derivative, RMI’s global climate tech accelerator, today announced a call for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) solutions for several pilot opportunities designed to validate the technology across diverse climates and building types in the United States and India.

Cooling is no longer a luxury — it is a global necessity essential for health, productivity, and survival. Conventional air conditioning and refrigeration currently account for more than 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Third Derivative is working to scale breakthrough cooling technologies that can cut emissions, improve resilience, and expand access to affordable cooling in heat-vulnerable regions.

“We are at a tipping point for cooling. Conventional, business-as-usual solutions are not enough — not enough to mitigate cooling-related climate pollution, and not enough to protect vulnerable communities against extreme heat.” said Rushad Nanavatty, Third Derivative’s managing director. “Those who need breakthrough cooling solutions the most are the least able to afford them. By accelerating the deployment of solutions like passive daytime radiative cooling, we can radically expand access to affordable, zero-energy cooling that addresses both challenges.”

PDRC technologies — such as paints, films, and membranes — have the potential to lower indoor temperatures by up to 18°F (10°C) on hot days without using electricity. RMI and Third Derivative are inviting leading PDRC manufacturers to apply for participation in upcoming global pilots. Selected products will be evaluated for their cooling performance, affordability, scalability, durability, toxicity, and embodied carbon.

Through these pilots, Third Derivative and partners will collect critical data to assess performance, evaluate human and environmental benefits, and advance commercialization pathways for promising solutions. Third Derivative’s pilot projects are designed to generate open-source evidence that supports equitable, transparent deployment of sustainable cooling solutions.

In India, Third Derivative is collaborating with a research institution and local grassroots partner to pilot PDRC products in an informal housing community in Ahmedabad, improving indoor comfort and community well-being amid rising heat stress. In the United States, Third Derivative will work with technical partners to test PDRC products on commercial buildings. Together, these pilots will demonstrate the technology’s versatility and scalability.

These projects in India and the United States are made possible through seed funding from the Autodesk Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund, respectively, whose early support is catalyzing the testing and scaling of zero-energy cooling solutions. Additional partners and funders are being engaged to expand the pilots to more sites, products, and geographies, advancing equitable, data-driven pathways for global deployment.

“Access to cooling is a matter of both fairness and survival,” said RMI CEO Jon Creyts. “With support from RMI, Third Derivative, and our ambitious partners, innovators have the opportunity to jump-start novel technologies that will transform how the world stays cool, without heating the planet.”

These efforts are part of RMI’s broader Global Cooling Initiative, which leverages cutting-edge startups, partners, and financing to advance sustainable cooling solutions, from efficient appliances to eco-friendly refrigerants and better refrigerant management.

Now, satellites and aircraft have become key tools to spot methane super-polluters like oil and gas operations, landfills, and coal mines – which is an important step in slowing down pollution.

Why methane matters to the climate

Many people know that carbon dioxide is the largest contributor to climate change. But methane matters, too, because of how effectively it traps heat in the atmosphere – like an extra-thick down duvet. In its first 20 years in the atmosphere, methane has about 80 times the warming impact compared to carbon dioxide. The short-acting but powerful effect of methane makes cleaning it up a prime target for slowing climate warming as quickly as possible.

But so far, it’s been hard to unravel exactly how much methane is being emitted, and from where.

Scientists know that methane can bubble up from diffuse sources like cow burps or flooded rice fields. Or it can pour into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations. Sometimes it leaks from defective equipment; sometimes it’s released intentionally. Some methane releases go unreported, and some emissions estimates appear to be significantly undercounted.

No matter the source, as the amount of methane in the atmosphere climbs ever higher, the race to pinpoint these pollution sources is accelerating.

How eyes in the sky can help

Satellite and aircraft observations are now revealing the myriad locations where methane pollution is occurring. Measurements from above show how oil and gas extraction, landfills, coal mines, and large-scale livestock agriculture operations are causing substantial amounts of methane pollution.

Riley Duren is the CEO of Carbon Mapper, one of several organizations using satellites to measure climate-warming greenhouse gases such as methane.

“Our current focus at Carbon Mapper is on methane monitoring of super-emitters, because that’s the biggest potential for immediate emission reductions,” Duren said.

He explained that as methane-measuring satellites proliferate, they’re helping to bring our fuzzy understanding of methane emissions into sharper focus.

The quickest bang-for-buck to slow climate-warming pollution would be to pinpoint the large emitters and work toward cleaning them up. These large-scale, point-source emissions account for about 40% of total methane emissions from human activities.

The Carbon Mapper data portal combines observations from five different instruments, and one of the most powerful aspects of this data is that it doesn’t rely on corporate or government reporting. Anyone can see the results for themselves.

Read: Climate polluters may be allowed to stop reporting their emissions. That doesn’t mean they can hide them.

Read on for the breakdown of some of the largest methane polluters observed in the U.S. These results are based on methane plumes measured by the five instruments within the Carbon Mapper data portal as of Oct. 16, 2025. These findings aren’t a comprehensive accounting of all methane emissions in the U.S., but they’re a snapshot of some of the largest and most persistent sources of methane pollution measured so far.

1. Oil and gas industry, especially in Texas and New Mexico

4,800 individual sources of large methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry have been measured and mapped to date

1.2 million pounds of methane released per hour in the U.S.

The Permian Basin is a region of thick sedimentary rocks in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. It’s the largest source of crude oil in the U.S., as well as a major producer of natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane.

Satellite images show thousands of plumes of methane billowing from numerous types of infrastructure: wells, pipelines, compressor stations, and gas processing facilities.

Sharon Wilson and Justin Mikulka work for a small nonprofit named Oilfield Witness that documents methane released from oil and gas infrastructure.

“The Permian is a methane disaster,” Mikulka said.

Many of these methane plumes are not leaks: “Those are intentional releases to protect the equipment and maintain operation,” Wilson said.

One example is flaring, which is when methane is burned intentionally. A methane flare looks dramatic because it makes a large flame. But burning methane is better for the climate than releasing it directly to the atmosphere, because burning methane converts it to the less potent carbon dioxide.

One problem with flaring, Wilson explained, is that the flares often malfunction. Sometimes they burn inefficiently, releasing a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. Even worse, the pilot light on the flares can go out, and then methane is not burned at all – it just vents directly to the atmosphere.

“I have tracked flares being unlit for well over a year,” she said.

In theory, flaring is supposed to be used infrequently. But Oilfield Witness analyzed the applications used by oil and gas companies as they requested permission to burn or vent methane in Texas. State regulators approved these applications over 99% of the time. A collaborative story between Inside Climate News and ProPublica paints the picture behind these massive methane emissions in Texas.

Satellite data can shine a light on the large and frequent releases of methane from oil and gas operations. In some situations, Duren and the Carbon Mapper team reach out to oil and gas operators when they find large methane plumes.

“We have seen a number of cases – over 150 to date – where operators do take steps to close leaks when notified,” he said.

But Wilson and Mikulka aren’t optimistic.

“The industry has the tools to track what they’re doing in real time, and yet nothing changes,” Mikulka said.

“There’s just absolutely no evidence that the U.S. oil and gas industry can produce oil and gas without huge methane emissions,” Wilson said.

2. Landfills

336 individual super-emitter landfills have been detected to date

500,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Landfills produce many of the largest plumes of methane measured by Carbon Mapper in the U.S.

Methane releases from oil and gas extraction are numerous, but they’re often short-lived or intermittent. By contrast, landfills tend to give off methane over months or years, which adds up to a substantial amount of methane pollution.

Given the large scale of methane coming from landfills, it’s all the more important to have accurate measurements. But reporting methods currently used by the EPA are not in agreement with data coming from aircraft and satellites. Several recent studies using aircraft and satellite measurements have found considerably larger emissions than the estimates from the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Landfill operators can use fairly simple measures to slow methane emissions, such as capturing and collecting the gas or using impermeable covers. Organic materials like food waste release large amounts of methane, and municipalities can divert food waste from landfills by using composting programs. As is often the case with cutting pollution, the economic benefits of implementing these actions are greater than the costs.

As of this writing, the U.S. landfills with the largest methane emissions based on Carbon Mapper observations are in Okeechobee, Florida, Orlando, Florida, and Melissa, Texas.

Note: The image from Orlando shows an optical effect over water. The dark surface of water makes it harder for instruments to “see” methane in the air. That’s why the methane plume is visible over the bridge but not over the water adjacent to the bridge.

3. Coal mines

192 super-emitter mines have been detected to date

220,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Coal formed when vegetation was buried in an oxygen-poor environment, compressed, and heated for millions of years. This same process also produced natural gas – which, again, is composed primarily of methane. The natural gas collects in coal seams and in the fractures and pores of the surrounding rock.

Underground mines are the largest source of concentrated methane emissions. In some cases, methane floats up from ventilation shafts, which are necessary to protect workers. Both active and abandoned coal mines can emit methane. Some methane emissions from coal mines can be captured, particularly where methane is coming from ventilation systems.

Individual mines can be the cause of disproportionately high amounts of methane pollution. For example, the Hail Creek mine in Queensland, Australia, accounts for 20% of all methane coming from coal mines in Australia, while producing only 1% of the country’s coal.

Worldwide, methane from coal mines is often underreported. In Australia, for example, data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite showed coal mines are emitting at least 40% more methane than previous estimates.

In the U.S., Carbon Mapper found the largest concentration of super-emitting coal mines in southwestern Pennsylvania and north-central West Virginia. The mines with the highest rates of methane emissions measured so far by Carbon Mapper are in Aleppo, Pennsylvania, Sycamore, Pennsylvania, and Burton, West Virginia.

4. Livestock

317 super-emitter livestock operations have been detected to date

47,000 pounds of methane emitted per hour

Livestock like cows and sheep produce methane as part of their digestive process. In most cases, methane emissions from livestock are too low in concentration to be detected by aerial measurements. These numerous but small sources of methane have a large impact on the atmosphere, especially when you consider the thousands of farms across the country. Nevertheless, satellites and aircraft can only spot the largest polluters, and they don’t see smaller, diffuse methane emissions that come from many farms.

Feedlots, large dairy farms, and animal processing facilities concentrate enough animals and their waste into small enough areas that their methane pollution can be detected with overhead measurements. These large methane plumes in the Carbon Mapper database are just a subset of the overall emissions from the livestock industry.

In the U.S., one of the most persistent sources of methane from livestock in the Carbon Mapper database so far is in Greeley, Colorado, which appears to be a cattle feedlot. Instruments have flown over this site more than 20 times, with methane detected 96% of the time, with maximum emissions measured at over 4,400 pounds per hour.

Together, these landmark laws launched the largest resurgence of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing in decades.","WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), along with Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (PA-2) today introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Strengthening Essential Manufacturing and Industrial (SEMI) Investment Act, landmark legislation that closes the most significant remaining gap in U.S. semiconductor policy: the lack of support for the materials that make chip manufacturing possible.

For years, China has controlled the global market for substrates, thin films, lithography materials, process chemicals, and other inputs that American fabs depend on. The SEMI Investment Act, introduced in the Senate by Senators Bennet, Blackburn, Tillis, and Coons, directly counters that imbalance. By extending the CHIPS tax credit to upstream materials, the bill ensures these capabilities are built in the United States, not outsourced to strategic competitors.

This reform strengthens America’s economic resilience, reduces exposure to coercive supply-chain pressures, and reinforces the industrial base that supports our national defense.

This legislation is supported by the leading organizations across America’s semiconductor, advanced materials, chemical, and manufacturing sectors, including SEMI, Entegris, CoorsTek, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Qnity Electronics, Brewer Science, the American Chemistry Council, the Compressed Gas Association, and EFC Gases & Advanced Materials.

“Semiconductor leadership starts long before a chip ever reaches a fabrication line—it starts with the materials that make modern manufacturing possible. Our SEMI Investment Act ensures those materials are built here at home. By expanding the credit to upstream suppliers, we secure every link of the semiconductor ecosystem, strengthen our resilience, reduce dependence on China, and give American manufacturers the certainty they need to compete, innovate, and lead,” said Fitzpatrick. “This is a bipartisan, practical solution to a structural weakness in our supply chain, and positions the United States to stay ahead for decades to come.”

Fitzpatrick continued, “Pennsylvania is already a national hub for advanced manufacturing, research, and engineering talent — and this legislation builds directly on that strength. As colleagues and proud Pennsylvanians, Congressman Boyle and I are working to bring materials production home, drive new investment into our region, support high-quality jobs, and ensure that Pennsylvania’s workers and industries remain at the forefront of America’s semiconductor future.”

“Revitalizing American semiconductor manufacturing is essential to our economic strength and our national security. I was proud to support the CHIPS and Science Act — and our new legislation builds on that work by strengthening our semiconductor supply chain for the long term,"" said Boyle.

Key Provisions of the Semi Investment Act

Expands the CHIPS Act tax credit to include upstream materials essential to semiconductor production.

Provides clear statutory definitions for direct and indirect production materials, reducing uncertainty for industry planning and investment.

Requires annual materials qualification lists from Treasury and Commerce, with an expedited review pathway for emerging technologies.

Extends the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit through 2031, aligning federal incentives with long-horizon capital investments.

Why This Legislation Is Urgently Needed

China controls up to 85% of global processing of rare earth elements and key semiconductor inputs.

These materials underpin America’s defense systems, AI computing, clean energy technologies, medical devices, and the broader innovation economy.

Without domestic materials production, CHIPS-funded fabs remain vulnerable to supply shocks, export controls, and strategic coercion from the Chinese Communist Party.

Background

Congressman Fitzpatrick has been a leading champion of strengthening America’s semiconductor competitiveness and rebuilding domestic manufacturing capacity. He was a champion of the original CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in 2022, which reestablished U.S. leadership in advanced chip production, created the 25% Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC), and helped drive more than $630 billion in announced semiconductor investments nationwide.

In 2023, Fitzpatrick also backed the Building Chips in America Act, which removed permitting barriers, accelerated project timelines, improved federal coordination, and ensured CHIPS investments could move from planning to construction more quickly.

Class of 2023

Environmental Studies, BA/Environmental Science and Policy, MS

You are the author of an environmental children’s book, Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew. What inspired you to write this book and what do you hope readers will glean from it?

During my time working as a naturalist for Westchester County Parks at Lenoir Preserve, I had the privilege of teaching children about the environment and the importance of protecting it. I quickly noticed that many existing children’s books with environmental themes focused on awareness, but not on action. As someone who believes deeply in empowering others to make a difference, I wanted to create a story that not only educated young readers but also inspired them to do something. To feel that they could be heroes for the planet, too.

That realization sparked Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew, designed to blend imagination, fun, and real-world impact. My hope is that children come away from the story feeling excited, capable, and ready to take small but meaningful actions to care for our Earth.

You graduated from Pace with a combined Environmental Studies, BA/Environmental Science and Policy, MS. How did your studies inspire and prepare you for authoring this book?

My studies were instrumental to the subject matter in the book. I’ve always loved spending time outdoors, but it wasn’t until I began my academic journey at Pace that I truly understood how the places I cherished and the wildlife I was passionate about protecting were being impacted by a changing climate. Through my coursework in environmental studies and environmental science and policy, I gained a deeper awareness of the challenges facing our planet and the interconnectedness between people, nature, and policy. My studies not only provided the scientific foundation for Greeny La-Roo and the Earth Crew but also strengthened my lifelong mission to protect the planet for current and future generations.

You also host a podcast called The Hopeful Environmentalist. Please tell us more about that.

I started The Hopeful Environmentalist (THE) podcast in my college apartment while pursuing my master’s degree at Pace. At the time, I was overwhelmed by the constant stream of bad news about our changing climate and its impacts on people, animals, and the planet. I craved a space that focused on hope, the kind that inspires action instead of despair. As I dove deeper, I realized that while science and policy are essential to solving the climate crisis, they’re often not translated in ways the public can easily understand. So, I created THE to bridge that gap.

Today, the podcast, rated top 11 best environmental podcast in 2023, has listeners in over 35 countries. You can listen to it anywhere you stream podcasts/music.

In addition to being an author, what has your career trajectory been like since graduation?

After finishing my degree, I moved to Washington, DC, to intern at the White House Council on Environmental Quality under the Biden-Harris Administration. I then relocated to North Dakota, where I worked as a contractor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on environmental policy, while also a social media assistant, podcast editor, and ultimately, communications coordinator for Our Climate. I soon realized how much I wanted to deepen my skills in storytelling and communication—so I began focusing on THE podcast. Through it, I’ve had the privilege of being invited to speak at the United Nations Conference on Biological Diversity and the UK Mission to the UN, as well as receiving media badges at EarthX’s Congress of Conferences and Climate Week NYC.

Next, I joined the Pace University Gale Epstein Center, where I currently work part-time on water policy initiatives, in addition to as a full-time social media coordinator at Vocal Media.

Through my coursework in environmental studies and environmental science and policy at Pace, I gained a deeper awareness of the challenges facing our planet and the interconnectedness between people, nature, and policy.

Why did you choose to attend Pace?

I was looking for a university that would not only provide a strong academic foundation but also offer opportunities to gain real-world experience and connect with organizations making a difference. The decision to attend Pace proved to be one of the best I’ve made. I gained practical experience in everything from field data collection to conducting informational interviews, and those experiences ultimately helped me earn an internship at the White House Council on Environmental Quality and has set my career in motion.

What activities and organizations were you involved with as a student?

I served as president of the NATURE Club, where I worked alongside a passionate group of students to create hands-on environmental experiences for the Pace community. We organized campus clean-up days, sustainability-focused events, and off-campus trips, including a memorable visit to the Wolf Conservation Center, to give students unique opportunities to connect with conservation organizations. Beyond the NATURE Club, I participated in the Environmental Studies and Science department’s Career Day, which introduced me to mentors and internship opportunities that helped shape the foundation of my career.

What were your experiences like in the Environmental Studies and Science department on the Pleasantville campus? What faculty had been instrumental in your journey as a student?

I truly loved my time in the Environmental Studies and Science department. Every professor I had played a role in shaping the environmentalist I am today by opening doors to opportunities I might never have discovered on my own. However, two professors who had the greatest impact on my journey were Professor John Cronin and Professor Michelle Land. Through their classes and mentorship, I gained a deeper understanding of the policy and advocacy side of the environmental field, a perspective that ultimately helped me secure an internship at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Their dedication to student success went far beyond the classroom, from organizing mock hearings to helping us build meaningful networks.

What advice would you give to our students, as they navigate college life?

Define your own path and stay open to where it may lead. Also, talk to your professors. Their mentorship and stories can open doors you didn’t even know existed. Further, take classes outside your major, explore topics that spark your curiosity, and seek experiences that fuel your passions, not just your resume. Most importantly, enjoy the process. College isn’t just about preparing for your career, it’s also about discovering who you are, what you care about, and what kind of impact you want to make.",https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/2025-11/dyson-article-teaser-environmental-studies-science-taylor-gannis.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:01.970887

That’s why battery temperature management (cooling or heating) is critical in electric vehicles.
Once the hottest point reaches the temperature limit, thermal throttling (thermal derating) kicks in and DC fast-charging speeds decrease.
According to Hydrohertz, it’s possible to reduce the DC fast-charging time of an EV battery by two-thirds, from approximately 30 minutes to around 10 minutes, through more precise cooling of the battery.
A more advanced approach to battery cooling should enable the full potential of existing battery technology to be unleashed.","Temperature is one of the most important factors for battery charging. Temperatures outside of the optimal range for a certain battery chemistry significantly limit the acceptable charge rate. That’s why battery temperature management (cooling or heating) is critical in electric vehicles.

Over the years, we have seen EV manufacturers move from air-cooled battery systems to liquid-cooled battery systems and improve them to achieve higher performance — for example, moving them from the bottom plate to the bottom and top plates.

However, most solutions still feature a single cooling loop for the entire battery pack, which proves to be a weak point because it creates a temperature difference between the beginning and the end of the loop. Once the hottest point reaches the temperature limit, thermal throttling (thermal derating) kicks in and DC fast-charging speeds decrease.

The Dectravalve

Hydrohertz, a startup founded in 2020, proposes a solution in the form of a multi-zone valve system that delivers precise heating, cooling, or energy recovery across up to four independently controlled zones from a single inlet. It’s called Dectravalve.

According to Hydrohertz, it’s possible to reduce the DC fast-charging time of an EV battery by two-thirds, from approximately 30 minutes to around 10 minutes, through more precise cooling of the battery. Of course, the charging performance is set for a specific battery chemistry and can be limited by the charger’s power (or voltage), but at least the temperature should no longer be the limiting factor.

Hydrohertz describes an experiment where it recharged a 100-kWh EV battery (LFP chemistry) without exceeding 44.5°C and with a difference of only 2.6°C across the whole pack. The company claims that the typical limit is usually 56°C, while the differences can be as high as 12°C.

Because the hottest cells do not trigger thermal throttling, the charging process can continue at maximum/high rate. Hydrohertz claims that charging from 10 to 80% state of charge is possible in around 10 minutes:

“In the same test, Dectravalve demonstrated that charging times can be slashed by up to 68%, meaning a typical 30-minute 10-80% charge on a 350kW fast charger could drop to around 10 minutes, putting EV charging on a par with conventional petrol/diesel vehicle refuelling times.”

An additional side effect of zonal cooling and modular thermal management is that during regular operation, the vehicle might be more efficient, which translates to lower energy consumption and higher range (especially in extreme ambient temperatures). Improved safety and longevity benefits were mentioned, too.

A more advanced approach to battery cooling should enable the full potential of existing battery technology to be unleashed. Hopefully, solutions like that will be viable and reliable, offering even better DC fast-charging capabilities.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251117-153353j.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:02:04.412868

Protecting primary forests is not just an environmental imperative — it is a strategic policy decision with climate, economic and social benefits.","Primary forests are the heart of the global climate and biodiversity agenda, underpinning key international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. These forests store dense carbon stocks while continuing to act as powerful carbon sinks. They also regulate water systems, reduce the risk of zoonotic disease, support livelihoods with essential resources, and provide irreplaceable habitat for countless species — many of them critically endangered and found nowhere else. Over 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity lives in forests, and primary forests host the highest concentrations of species: especially those that are endemic, endangered or both. Primary forests fulfil a host of ecological functions, and the loss of these ecosystems is permanent — no restoration plan can replicate the complexity and resilience of intact forest landscapes within a reasonable timeframe, if ever.

Since 2001, the world has lost at least 83 million hectares of tropical primary forest and 50 million hectares of intact boreal forest. In 2024 alone, tropical primary forest loss exceeded 6.7 million hectares, releasing more than 3.1 gigatonnes of CO into the atmosphere — slightly more than India’s fossil fuel emissions that year. This marks a doubling of loss from 2023 and the highest annual rate in two decades — an alarming reversal of hard-won progress. Despite rising awareness, much of the global response remains misaligned and siloed. Although restoration efforts are extremely important to repairing functionality and restoring habitat in degraded areas and ought to be continually funded, these efforts should not be at the expense of preventing further deforestation and degradation of the primary forests that remain.

We cannot plant our way out of deforestation: prevention is more effective, more cost-efficient and ecologically far superior.

A fundamental shift is needed in both policy and finance frameworks concerned with forest ecosystem integrity which sustains primary forests. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), through the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), aims to protect 30% of the planet by 2030, and countries are striving to make progress towards this target. Fortunately, the CBD took critical steps both in Montreal and in Cali to integrate a clear and strong ecosystem integrity mandate into the GBF in Goal A, and Targets 1, 2, 8 and 12. Of course, the comprehensive focus on ecosystem integrity in the GBF by definition includes primary forests, but it is important to recognise this explicitly in the CBD at COP 17. The financial commitments made through CBD by countries earlier this year represent a critical milestone, but unless primary forests are explicitly prioritised in national strategies, we are sadly liable to continue seeing significant deforestation and degradation, as was the case in 2024. Similarly, the financial commitments made at UNFCCC COP29 represent an important step towards accelerating action to combat climate change — but primary forest conservation remains an overlooked solution within climate dialogues.

Where primary forests remain, governments must integrate primary forest protection into their international commitments and back those promises with legally binding safeguards, robust monitoring, enforceable protections, policy coherence and elimination of harmful incentives. In parallel, global finance must evolve. Current funding models fall short in prioritising conservation efforts with the highest ecological returns — leaving primary forests underfunded and exposing biodiversity, climate and communities to avoidable harm.

Beyond just a new policy, safeguarding primary forests demands an evolution of mindset: environmental protection isn’t a barrier to economic growth — it’s a value-add, a long-term investment in resilience, stability and prosperity of the planet.

These ecosystems are not liabilities to be cleared or degraded for development — they are assets, already delivering high-value ecological services that underpin healthy societies and healthy economies.

Innovative financial mechanisms can help close this gap. Redirecting climate finance toward avoided deforestation strategies, including payments to communities for ecosystem services and sovereign debt swaps for countries which steadfastly protect their primary forests, can unlock substantial resources to maintain and restore the ecosystem integrity of forests. Nations and communities demonstrating effective forest stewardship should be directly rewarded. Moreover, Indigenous Peoples and local communities who have stewarded these landscapes for generations offer robust networks and approaches for maintaining these landscapes, a fact which has been reinforced by decisions made at CBD COP16 last year. Their governance systems have proven effective at protecting primary forests for millennia, and they are to this day both dependents and stewards of these ecosystems. Securing Indigenous land rights and channelling direct financial support to Indigenous forest stewards is not only equitable — it is a proven conservation strategy.

Some global conservation initiatives are already pushing for these changes and are backed by funding from multilateral organisations. For example, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which provides the largest funding for forest protection globally, supports the conservation of tropical primary forests as a priority globally - -notably through the Amazon, Congo and Other Critical Forest Biomes Integrated Program, endowed with $306 million grants leveraging in addition around $1.5 billion, as well as through other global projects executed by IUCN, Wild Heritage, Griffith University and other pioneering partners. These initiatives demonstrate that investing in primary forest integrity can simultaneously advance benefits for climate, biodiversity, people and economies, creating a win-win situation for everyone.

Protecting primary forests is not just an environmental imperative — it is a strategic policy decision with climate, economic and social benefits. Yet without immediate intervention, these ecosystems will continue to disappear, weakening global efforts to combat climate change and stem accelerating biodiversity loss. Policymakers must act to close policy gaps, realign and unlock financial flows, and position primary forests as foundational to global sustainability

South Dakota shouldn’t miss out in reaping the benefits for its citizens and helping advance U.S. dominance in innovation.","President Donald Trump has been clear in both his policies and rhetoric that he wants to help America win the next wave of technological innovation. But earlier this month, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang sounded the alarm to the Financial Times: “China is going to win the AI race.” A critical step to help realize the President’s vision is to build more data centers, and South Dakota can help.

In America, we need more digital infrastructure. Essential components of that infrastructure are more data centers. These facilities house all the cloud storage for Americans and our businesses, and as we continue to use more tech tools, our need for more data centers grows. President Trump recognizes this need and is championing the rapid build-out of U.S. data centers for AI infrastructure, streamlining permitting and incentivizing investment so America creates good jobs and leads the global technology race. However, there have been three rising challenges to this build-out of critical digital infrastructure which must be addressed. Much of the information circulating on these topics as they relate to data centers is misleading at best: energy consumption, water use and taxes.

Data Centers Help Reduce Everyone Else’s Electricity Bills

By helping the state’s electrical utilities to modernize South Dakota’s grid, hyperscale data centers can build new power generation and transmission that improves reliability. At the same time, these large-load data centers will pay a greater share of the utilities’ fixed costs. This puts downward pressure on electricity bills for households.

New research for the U.S. Department of Energy by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found higher load growth from industries like data centers reduces electricity prices for other customers.

Berkeley’s research was featured in a Washington Post article, “There’s a reason electricity prices have been rising. And it’s not data centers.” Berkeley Labs found that North Dakota, which experienced a 40% increase in electricity demand thanks to new data centers, saw real electricity prices fall by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. And Virginia, home to more data centers than anyone in the world, experienced a 14% increase in demand and a price drop of 1 cent per kilowatt-hour.

Berkeley Labs found that North Dakota, which experienced a 40% increase in electricity demand thanks to new data centers, saw real electricity prices fall by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Moreover, in their 2024 study of Virginia’s data center industry, the Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission (JLARC) found that Virginia ratepayers are not footing the bill for data centers, and that the State Corporation Commission has the tools to continue to ensure ratepayer protection. According to Kansas electric utility Evergy, “Large load customers, including data centers, absorb a greater share of the fixed costs of operating grid infrastructure (power plants, poles and wires), thus lowering rates for all customers.”

Data centers invest in the local grid, bringing lower electricity bills and more reliable energy for South Dakota businesses and households.

Data Centers Use Less Water Than a Courthouse or Office Building

Many new large-scale data centers will consume less water than your average courthouse or office by using a high-tech version of the electricity-powered air conditioning similar to that which cools our homes, schools and businesses.

In the parts of South Dakota where water is abundant, new data centers could use evaporative cooling on the warmest days of the year to reduce electricity demand. In those data centers, some of the water would evaporate into the skies above South Dakota, just like an irrigated cornfield, reservoir or golf course. The water that doesn’t evaporate is then returned to the municipal system or aquifer, as approved by local and state water authorities. This efficient technology ensures that local water resources are used smartly and sparingly to protect the community’s water supply.

Virginia again leads by example on getting to the root of this issue. Being the state with the most data centers in the country, it performed a state audit that found that the data centers using water do so in a sustainable and well-regulated manner.

Data Center Property Taxes Provide Relief for Residential Taxpayers and New Community Investment

Sales tax is commonly exempted for manufacturing inputs and equipment. 35 states–including South Dakota’s neighbors North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming–already exempt sales tax for capital-intensive industries like data centers. Hyperscale data centers are not built in states where they’re disproportionately taxed due to an outdated tax code, so without modernization, South Dakota will lose investment, jobs, and tax revenue to other states.

Moreover, data center builders bring substantial new property tax revenue to the communities where they locate, which provides property tax relief for homeowners, and funds local schools and infrastructure projects. This modernization brings an increase in property tax revenue for cities and counties. For example, Virginia’s data center industry contributes $9 billion to the state’s GDP and funds local schools and infrastructure. Virginia’s Loudoun County states that data center tax revenue “has enabled the county to reduce the real property tax rate for homeowners every year for the past decade.”

Virginia’s Loudoun County states that data center tax revenue “has enabled the county to reduce the real property tax rate for homeowners every year for the past decade.”

Modernizing South Dakota’s tax code to attract new industries like data centers will keep the Mount Rushmore State competitive with its neighbors and attract good jobs, investment and new property tax revenues.

As President Trump noted in July, “We believe that America’s destiny is to dominate every industry and be the first in every technology.” Data centers, essential digital infrastructure for the next generation of technological advancement, have already contributed 4.7 million American jobs and nearly $800 billion per year to our economy.

“Our findings paint a grim picture: a toxic combination of increasing energy prices, rising overdue balances, and squeezed household budgets that together are pushing families deeper and deeper into debt,” The Century Foundation wrote.

“Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.”

Late balances for utility bills outpaced inflation 2.7 times during the studied period, according to the think tank. It said that Black families were three times more likely to have an overdue balance than white ones, noting that Black and Asian households also had the highest late bills.

“Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance,” The Century Foundation explained.

Late balances for families with well-below-average credit scores increased by 30% during the studied period, the organization added. Those households were disproportionately in urban and low-income neighborhoods, according to the think tank.

“These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation – and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill,” The Century Foundation said. “Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.”

The organization accused the Trump administration of failing to address the root causes of “energy inflation” and hindering the development of renewable energy.

President Donald Trump has targeted renewable energy projects by reducing federal support for them. He has said that sources like wind and solar are unreliable and worse options than oil and gas, which he claims are more beneficial for the economy.

The first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order to protect the country’s “economic and national security” and “military preparedness” by making sure an “abundant” supply of reliable energy was available in every state.

“It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years,” the president said. “It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.”",https://wpde.com/resources/media/5f1f45d9-e3d0-4bcb-9bca-575bccbe40ee-GettyImages2165132907.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:55.671537

The proposed rule would dramatically narrow which waters are covered by federal safeguards, leaving many wetlands and headwaters vulnerable to pollution and destruction. These waters are vital for filtering drinking water, reducing flood and drought risks, and sustaining wildlife—but under the planned rule, many of them would no longer be protected.

NRDC’s 2025 GIS analysis found that between 38 million and 70 million acres of wetlands are at risk of pollution or destruction under modeled scenarios similar to the changes the proposal includes.

“This is a reckless giveaway to polluters,” says Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president, Nature, at NRDC. “By gutting protections for wetlands and streams, the EPA is trying to disown its legal obligation to protect our drinking water and our communities. For the millions of Americans who swim or fish in our nation’s rivers and lakes, this is a bracing slap in the face. Wetlands are nature’s safeguard against flooding, and stripping away protections for them puts millions of people in harm’s way. At a time when climate change is fueling stronger storms and worsening floods, taking away these protections is not just shortsighted—it’s dangerous.”

“The EPA’s proposal is an extreme and unscientific exploitation of an already extreme and unscientific Supreme Court ruling,” says Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC. “Erasing protections for wetlands and streams that clearly affect downstream water quality and community safety ignores decades of hydrological science and will create regulatory chaos, leaving businesses, farmers, and communities with less certainty while exposing waters to more pollution.”

“Instead of undermining the Clean Water Act, the EPA should be building durable, science-based safeguards that honor both the law and the realities of how water moves across the landscape,” Devine says.

Background:

The EPA’s new proposed rule sharply narrows which wetlands and streams are protected under the Clean Water Act. The proposed rule would limit federal safeguards only to wetlands that hold surface water during the “wet season” and directly touch a water body like a river or stream that has continuous water flowing or standing during that “wet season.”

This approach excludes many critical wetlands and seasonal streams—waters that are essential for drinking water supplies, flood control, and ecosystem health.",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-17 16:01:04.690201

Policymakers across the political spectrum increasingly agree that modernizing the federal permitting process is essential to deploying energy infrastructure at the pace and scale needed to meet U.S. economic, environmental, and energy security goals. Despite this growing consensus, questions remain about the most effective options to make permitting more predictable, coordinated, and timely while maintaining key environmental safeguards and opportunities for public input.

As part of its ongoing effort to explore bipartisan approaches to permitting reform, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a roundtable in October 2025 to discuss key provisions in the House of Representatives’ bipartisan Simplifying Permitting for Efficient and Effective Deployment (SPEED) Act. The roundtable focused on the version of the legislation introduced in July 2025 by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME). The legislation proposes a range of reforms aimed at improving the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting process, updating judicial review standards, and strengthening project certainty across federal agencies. The roundtable was composed of more than forty experts in energy and the intersection of energy and environmental issues, and conversation largely centered on those areas.

Participants broadly agreed that the current permitting system for critical energy infrastructure projects is too slow and unpredictable, and that reforms to NEPA and judicial review could meaningfully improve permitting timelines and project certainty. Participants largely supported the overall direction and intent of the SPEED Act, particularly the provisions designed to streamline environmental reviews by setting clearer limits on which environmental effects agencies must study, and to reduce litigation-driven delays. However, there was significant debate over the details, especially concerning the precision of statutory language, the balance between efficiency and environmental oversight, and the degree to which Congress should limit judicial remedies—such as injunctions or vacating permits.

While perspectives varied, the roundtable discussion reflected a shared commitment to improving the permitting process. Participants emphasized that careful drafting and bipartisan coordination are essential to ensure that any reforms—whether through the SPEED Act or a broader legislative package—strengthen efficiency and accountability, and are durable across several administrations and Congresses.

This roundtable builds on BPC’s continuing work to evaluate pragmatic permitting solutions. Previous discussions in this series have focused on various permitting subtopics, such as community engagement, linear infrastructure, and reforms to the Clean Water Act. Together, these convenings aim to identify realistic pathways toward a permitting reform framework that accelerates energy deployment while preserving public trust in environmental decision-making.

This roundtable discussion focused on 18 specific reforms proposed in the SPEED Act. The issue brief will summarize the discussion and areas of consensus and divergent opinions among the participants present.

NEPA Reforms

Policy Option 1: Clarify that NEPA is a procedural statute only and does not mandate specific environmental outcomes.

The National Environmental Policy Act, the first major environmental law in the United States, was signed by President Richard Nixon on January 1, 1970. The statute emerged amid growing public concern about air and water pollution, oil spills, and habitat destruction. These pressures pushed policymakers to recognize that federal decisions on infrastructure, development, and resource use could cause long-term damage to both natural and human environments, and that the government needed a more deliberate process for evaluating those impacts.

NEPA requires federal agencies to assess and disclose the environmental consequences of major actions before making decisions. The law established a framework for environmental reviews. Under this framework, agencies prepare environmental impact statements (EISs) for actions expected to have significant impacts and environmental assessments (EAs), which are categories of actions that the agency has determined do not normally have significant environmental impacts. Agencies may also rely on categorical exclusions (CEs), which are categories of actions that the agency has determined not to have significant environmental effects. Because CEs are defined in advance and grounded in experience, projects that fit within an existing CE can move through the NEPA process quicker, when compared to EISs and EAs.

Over time, NEPA’s scope and impact have evolved as courts, agencies, and regulators have expanded the scope of analysis required under the statute. Judicial interpretations have broadened what constitutes “significant” environmental effects, while agencies have conducted extensive and time-consuming reviews, mainly in an attempt to avoid or successfully defend against legal challenges. These trends have added layers of complexity to the process and resulted in longer review timelines and greater project uncertainty. As BPC’s SPEED Act explainer notes, the legislation clarifies that NEPA is a procedural statute that does not mandate any specific environmental outcomes.

Roundtable participants debated whether explicitly codifying that NEPA is a procedural statute would meaningfully improve permitting outcomes or simply reaffirm existing precedent (e.g., Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County (1970). Several participants noted that courts have long recognized NEPA as a procedural law and questioned whether legislative clarification would have any practical effect. Some suggested such clarification could help restore predictability and constrain the trend toward ever-expanding reviews. A few participants cautioned, however, that the courts and the public could interpret the effort to reaffirm NEPA’s original purpose as weakening environmental protection or limiting agencies’ flexibility to address new information or community concerns.

Overall, the roundtable agreed that NEPA should remain focused on transparency and informed decision-making rather than being the sole determiner of outcomes. Most participants supported reaffirming NEPA’s procedural foundation in principle, but opinions were split on whether doing so through legislation would offer tangible benefits.

Policy Option 2: Limit the scope of review to effects that are reasonably foreseeable and proximately caused by the project, excluding speculative or attenuated impacts, impacts separate in time or place, or those tied to separate projects.

Since NEPA’s enactment in 1970, both court decisions and agency practice, guided in part by CEQ’s 1978 regulations, have expanded what qualifies as an “effect”. Early cases like Calvert Cliffs’ Coordinating Committee v. Atomic Energy Commission (1971) required agencies to evaluate the environmental consequences of their actions. CEQ’s regulations, which for decades have shaped how executive agencies structure their NEPA processes, incorporated that approach by calling for the analysis of direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. Although this more expansive practice strengthened environmental accountability, it has also broadened the scope of review beyond what some believe Congress originally intended and has contributed to lengthier permitting processes. The SPEED Act attempts to address this issue by clarifying that environmental review should focus on effects that are reasonably foreseeable and proximately caused by a project, excluding speculative or remote impacts.

Roundtable participants generally supported focusing environmental reviews on effects that are direct and foreseeable, but they raised concerns about how the proposed statutory language would function in practice. Many described the language as overly broad and imprecise, noting that it could create new uncertainty rather than streamline the review process. One participant observed that every effect could be thought of as separate in time and place. Some participants cautioned that the use of the word “limit” could be interpreted too narrowly and exclude legitimate analysis of indirect or cumulative effects that are often necessary to understand a project’s overall environmental impact.

Participants emphasized that this policy option’s effectiveness would depend on precise drafting in the legislation and clear guidance to agencies. Some warned that ambiguous or open-ended language could invite litigation over the scope of analysis and ultimately undermine the policy option’s goal of improving efficiency. Overall, thereF was broad agreement that clarifying NEPA’s scope could be helpful, but most participants viewed this policy option as too imprecise to achieve that goal without unintended consequences.

Policy Option 3: Allow the review process conducted under other federal statutes to satisfy NEPA review requirements.

NEPA reviews often overlap with other environmental statutes that impose similar requirements. For example, a single project may trigger review under the Clean Water Act for discharges, the Endangered Species Act for impacts on protected species, and the Clean Air Act for emissions. Each statute has its own standards, timelines, and administrative processes, often involving separate documentation, interagency consultations, and public comment periods. This overlap can result in duplicative analysis where multiple agencies examine the same environmental impacts under different statutes.

Participants generally viewed this policy option as a practical step toward reducing duplication in agency reviews. They noted, however, that the policy option lacks a clear process for determining when another statute’s review would be considered functionally equivalent to NEPA. One participant urged creating a transparent process for determining equivalence and pointed out that without it, this policy option could itself become a litigation magnet. Other participants noted that it was unclear which agencies would make the equivalence determination and how much detail would be required to demonstrate it. As an example to follow, participants pointed to the permitting process for Class VI wells in which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gives primacy to states.

Overall, participants supported the policy option’s intent and agreed that clarifying when and how existing federal reviews can satisfy NEPA requirements could help reduce redundant analysis, if the legislation clearly defines the process for establishing equivalence.

Policy Option 4: Allow state or tribal reviews to satisfy NEPA requirements if these reviews determine that applicants have met NEPA standards.

This option builds on policy option three’s discussion of functional equivalence among federal statutes by extending the same concept to state and tribal environmental reviews. In some cases, states already conduct assessments that are similar in scope to NEPA, such as California’s Environmental Quality Act. This option aims to clarify that federal agencies could rely on these state or tribal reviews—when they meet NEPA standards—thereby avoiding repetitive review of the same project impacts.

Some participants suggested that if a state process is functionally equivalent to NEPA, a federal agency should be able to rely on that analysis to avoid duplication. Others cautioned that this could disincentivize states from reforming their own review processes and argued that the federal government should focus on improving NEPA rather than relying on varying state standards. Discussion on this policy option was brief, with one participant expressing support while another questioned whether it could backfire, depending on which agency determines equivalence. Overall, most participants emphasized that the onus should be on the federal government to improve NEPA.

Policy Option 5: Prohibit agencies from rescinding or altering completed environmental documents unless ordered to do so by a court.

Under current practice, federal agencies can revisit or withdraw previously finalized environmental documents or project approvals, sometimes following changes in presidential administration or policy direction. These reversals require project sponsors to repeat parts of the review process or halt construction despite having completed the required environmental reviews. These follow-up actions can increase uncertainty and project risk, increase costs, undermine long-term planning, and discourage investment.

Participants broadly supported efforts to strengthen project certainty and prevent completed environmental reviews from being reopened or withdrawn without cause. Several described this policy option as an important way to ensure stability across administrations and to give developers confidence that projects can move forward once reviews are complete. However, several participants emphasized that precise statutory language would be essential to make this provision effective and to avoid unintended consequences. A few participants questioned whether such language would actually prevent bad-faith rescissions, as agencies could still find other avenues to reopen reviews, and they suggested including an option requiring project sponsors to concur when an agency identifies a genuine error.

Policy Option 6: Require statements of purpose and need in environmental documents to align with the goals of the project applicant.

Under NEPA, an agency’s statement of purpose and need defines the objectives of a proposed project and guides the range of alternatives analyzed in an EA or EIS. In practice, agencies must evaluate a range of alternatives that could meet those objectives, including the project proposed by the applicant, a “no action” option, and other feasible approaches. When the agency defines the purpose differently than the applicant, it can expand the scope of alternatives, lengthen review timelines, and create tension over whether the agency has effectively redefined the project itself.

The SPEED Act includes this policy option to clarify that purpose and need statements should align with the applicant’s goals. This would ensure that agencies evaluate alternatives relevant to the project being proposed rather than redefining its objectives.

Participants discussed whether this policy option would appropriately balance agency authority with applicant goals. One participant cited Burlington v. Busey (1990), noting that courts have found agency authority to be primary in defining a project’s purpose. They cautioned that writing applicant goals directly into statute could invite courts or agencies to interpret the provision as a mandate to defer to the applicant’s definition in all circumstances, potentially constraining legitimate agency discretion. Several participants cautioned that a strained civil service capacity could also complicate implementation. Others agreed that while agency authority should remain primary, agencies should also consider the applicant’s goals when determining whether a project falls within their statutory authority. Overall, participants agreed that the underlying problem is real, but several were unsure whether this policy option was the right statutory fix.

Policy Option 7: Allow deadline extensions only with a project applicant’s approval.

NEPA includes statutory time limits for environmental reviews—generally, one year for EAs and two years for EISs—as established by the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act. Under current law, those deadlines may be extended only with the approval of the project applicant, after consultation with cooperating agencies. The SPEED Act builds on those provisions by specifying that any extensions to those timelines can be granted only with the approval of the project applicant. Supporters view this as a way to give developers greater certainty over project timelines and to discourage unnecessary delays, while maintaining flexibility for cases where additional time is genuinely needed.

Participants discussed how this policy option would interact with existing statutory timelines and agency practice. Several participants raised broader questions about whether deadlines are effective at all and whether this policy option is needed. Some cautioned that stricter limits could push more NEPA work into the preapplication period, effectively hiding how long reviews take. Others suggested that pairing firm timelines with stronger judicial review provisions could make the process more effective. Overall, participants agreed that the policy option’s intent to enhance accountability and predictability was sound, but views differed on whether requiring applicant approval would meaningfully improve review timelines.

Policy Option 8: Agencies do not have to undertake or consider new studies after an application is submitted or a notice of intent is issued.

This provision in the SPEED Act is intended to prevent permitting delays that occur when agencies initiate or evaluate new studies after a project application has been submitted or a notice of intent has been issued. In current practice, new information, such as recently published studies or data, can prompt additional analysis or supplemental environmental documents and extend review timelines. This policy option intends to provide greater certainty by clarifying that agencies are not obligated to undertake or consider new studies introduced after the review process has formally begun.

Participants expressed a mix of support and concern regarding this policy option. Several agreed that the intent was sensible and could help reduce delays. Others worried that the language might be interpreted too broadly and would prevent agencies from considering new information that could materially affect environmental outcomes. Furthermore, some participants noted that this policy option could create confusion about how agencies should handle studies completed after a draft EIS is issued. Overall, participants agreed that while the goal of improving timeliness was sound, careful drafting would be needed to ensure that agencies retain the ability to consider relevant new information when appropriate. Last, some participants recommended tying the cutoff to the issuance of a draft EIS, which they viewed as a more defensible point to limit new information.

Policy Option 9: Require agencies not to delay review to await anticipated new studies.

Environmental reviews under NEPA can take years to complete, and one contributing factor is agencies delaying action while awaiting anticipated new studies, datasets, or modeling results. Such delays can extend project timelines even when the existing information is sufficient to complete the review. The SPEED Act includes this policy option to clarify that agencies should proceed with their analysis using currently available information rather than pausing to await future studies.

Participants discussed this policy option briefly. Some viewed it as a logical companion to the previous provision on new studies, intended to prevent agencies from using anticipated research as a reason to postpone project reviews. However, others questioned whether the intent was to avoid unnecessary delays or to permit agencies to disregard potentially relevant information. The roundtable ultimately did not reach consensus on this policy option.

Policy Option 10: Extend the window of programmatic EIS/EA documents from five years to 10 years, subject to reevaluation.

A programmatic environmental impact statement or environmental assessment analyzes the environmental effects of a broader policy, program, plan, or group of related actions rather than a single project. These documents allow agencies to “tier” subsequent, project-specific reviews from the broader analysis. Agencies generally reevaluate programmatic analyses every five years to determine whether new circumstances or information require supplementation.

The SPEED Act would double this window and extend the period in which agencies may rely on a programmatic document from five years to 10 years. The goal is to reduce the frequency of reevaluations, improve predictability, and allow agencies to extend the use of resource-intensive programmatic analyses.

Participants had mixed opinions on this policy option. Some supported it, describing it as a straightforward improvement that would make programmatic reviews more useful. A few participants questioned whether extending the timeframe would make a significant difference in practice and pointed out the difficulty in predicting future conditions.

Several participants suggested that programmatic reviews could be especially valuable for energy transition minerals (such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements used in the production of clean energy technologies), where environmental conditions and resource locations are unlikely to change significantly over a decade. One participant noted that landscapes involving nickel or other mineral deposits evolve slowly, making a 10-year window appropriate. Overall, most agreed that this policy option would reduce administrative burdens, while others felt this policy option was not particularly important.

Policy Option 11: Allow agencies to adopt categorical exclusions established by agencies, including those legislated by Congress.

Under current practice, agencies may adopt CEs in another agency’s NEPA procedures if they determine that it fits their own activities and complies with applicable requirements. Although CEQs guidance has historically shaped how agencies develop and use CEs, the Supreme Court’s recent Seven Counties decision has clarified that CEQ’s regulations do not carry binding force for all federal agencies. As a result, agency-specific NEPA procedures, rather than CEQ regulations, now govern the establishment and application of CEs.

The SPEED Act would expand existing authority by allowing agencies to apply CEs that were created by Congress for another agency. For example, a statutory CE created by Congress for the Department of Transportation could be applied by the Department of Energy (DOE) for a similar class of infrastructure projects. This change aims to reduce duplication and streamline reviews by allowing agencies to rely on statutory CEs rather than conducting new analyses for similar actions.

Participants generally viewed this policy option favorably. Several said it would reduce redundant analysis and improve efficiency by allowing agencies to make use of CEs that Congress has already designated. There was no significant opposition, and participants characterized the policy option as a practical step to streamlining permitting.

Policy Option 12: Narrow the definition of “major federal action.”

Under NEPA, environmental review is required for “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment.” This phrase determines when NEPA applies, and its interpretation has long been debated. There is no definition of “major federal action” within NEPA, although the recent Fiscal Responsibility Act added a list of actions that are explicitly not considered major federal actions. The SPEED Act would modify and expand that list.

Under current law, certain forms of federal assistance are excluded from NEPA when the federal agency lacks sufficient control over the project. The SPEED Act would tighten this standard by specifying that such assistance is not a major federal action unless the agency has “complete control and responsibility” over the project; it would also add grants, farm loans, and guarantees to the list of excluded actions and clarify that federal funding alone does not trigger NEPA.

Participants widely agreed that the goal of this policy option is important but raised concerns about the proposed language. Several commented that “complete control” seemed too narrow and could create loopholes that allow agencies to avoid environmental review. A participant noted that narrowing the definition of a major federal action could have potential consequences, such as allowing the federal government to avoid NEPA for projects in which it has substantial involvement (e.g., “Alligator Alcatraz”) or for other projects where agencies provide significant funding or approvals but could still claim they lack “complete control and responsibility.” This could create pathways to bypass NEPA despite meaningful federal influence over a project’s outcome.

Participants pointed out that DOE and other agencies often enter into cooperative agreements, where the federal government exercises significant but not complete control. Some supported this change, questioning whether projects receiving federal cost shares should be treated differently from identical projects developed without federal funding.

Additionally, some participants argued that NEPA should apply when federal funding influences project design or siting decisions, but not when funds are distributed after a project is already planned or underway. One participant cited as a potential model certain thresholds at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where projects below 5% federal funding typically do not trigger NEPA, those between 5% and one-third are decided on a case-by-case basis, and those above one-third normally require review.

A few participants emphasized the need to explicitly define “major federal action” in statute to avoid decades of inconsistent case law and administrative interpretation. Others urged “not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” noting that this provision in the SPEED Act could incentivize greater cooperation between developers and agencies even if it does not fully resolve the issue.

Policy Option 13: Add “energy” to CEQ’s list of national policy goals, alongside conservation, social, economic, and health.

The Council on Environmental Quality issues governmentwide NEPA guidance and maintains a statement of environmental policy goals that federal agencies often use to inform their decision-making. These goals emphasize the conservation of natural resources, the balance of economic and environmental priorities, and the promotion of social and health welfare. The SPEED Act would add “energy” to the list of national policy goals. The intent is to recognize energy development as a core national objective and ensure it is considered in federal decision-making processes.

Most participants viewed this policy option favorably, describing it as a symbolic but useful acknowledgment of energy’s important role in national policy. Several noted that energy could already fall under the existing “economic” goal but agreed that explicitly naming it could help guide how agencies balance priorities.

Judicial Review Reforms

Policy Option 14: Establish a two-part test for overturning agency actions.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts overturn agency decisions if they find them “arbitrary and capricious.” In practice, this has allowed courts to vacate permits even for procedural NEPA errors that may have no bearing on an agency’s final decision. To address this issue, the SPEED Act would establish a stricter, two-part test for judicial review: A court could overturn or reject an agency decision based on its noncompliance with NEPA only if it finds both that the agency “abused its substantial discretion” when rendering its decision, and that its decision would have been different but for that abuse of discretion. In short, the goal is to limit judicial intervention to truly consequential NEPA analytical and decisional errors and provide greater project certainty once reviews are complete.

Participants viewed this option as a major change that would raise the bar for overturning agency decisions. Several described the second part—requiring proof that the outcome would have changed but for the agency’s NEPA error—as the most important feature, as it would prevent costly injunctions and remands (when a court sends a decision back to an agency) when a procedural flaw has no decisive effect. Others questioned what “abuse of substantial discretion” means as a legal standard and whether it merely restates the existing “arbitrary and capricious” test.

Some participants supported this policy option in principle but worried that the threshold could be too high and could make it difficult to correct genuine deficiencies in environmental reviews. Overall, the group agreed that the policy option aims to reduce unnecessary litigation and improve predictability, but many emphasized that its effectiveness would depend on how courts interpret and apply the new standard.

Policy Option 15: Prohibit courts from substituting their judgment on environmental effects for that of the agency.

Under NEPA, courts sometimes evaluate not just whether an agency followed proper procedures but whether its conclusions about environmental impacts were reasonable. This review can allow judges to second-guess technical decisions and effectively redo an agency’s analysis. The second-guessing can contribute to uncertainty and inconsistency across jurisdictions. To address this issue, the SPEED Act clarifies that courts may not substitute their own judgment for that of the agency when they review environmental effects.

Participants expressed mixed views on this policy option. Several questioned how courts could determine whether an agency would have reached a different decision (the standard set forth in Policy Option 14 above) without substituting their own judgment—a contradiction between the policy options that one participant described as “impossible to reconcile.” Others felt the language simply restated existing practice, noting that the Supreme Court’s recent Seven Counties decision reaffirmed that NEPA is a procedural statute and that courts may not second-guess an agency’s expert technical judgments so long as the agency has taken a ‘hard look’. A few participants appreciated the intent to limit unnecessary judicial intervention but doubted this language would be effective in doing so, as judges would likely interpret it inconsistently.

Policy Option 16: Limit court remedies to remand with instructions and deadlines (judges could not issue injunctions or vacate permits).

Currently, when courts find a violation under NEPA, they can vacate the permit or issue injunctions while agencies correct deficiencies in their analyses. These remedies can add to project costs even if the judicially determined defect is procedural or would not change the agency’s permitting decision. The SPEED Act would limit courts to remanding a case to the agency with instructions specifying what needs to be fixed in the analysis and a deadline of no more than 180 days. This approach is intended to provide greater project certainty by preventing minor issues from delaying project commencement.

Although many in the room favored the increased use of remand with instructions over injunctions or vacating permits, most participants opposed this policy option as written. Several said that if courts cannot vacate permits or issue injunctions, NEPA would be left without any real enforcement power. Some argued that this remedy might not be sufficient when the bar for court action had been raised to “substantial abuse” by the relevant agency. Others agreed that while lengthy litigation can delay projects, they felt that this approach went beyond what could be supported in a bipartisan deal. Some participants argued that the policy option might help agencies and developers keep projects moving while minor issues are resolved. Overall, participants viewed this as one of the most controversial provisions in the SPEED Act.

Policy Option 17: Shorten the statute of limitations for NEPA challenges to 150 days.

Currently lawsuits challenging NEPA reviews can, in most cases, be filed up to six years after a permit approval. This leaves agencies and developers uncertain long after the review has been completed and a permit issued. The SPEED Act would shorten the statute of limitations for filing NEPA challenges to 150 days after the final agency action.

Every participant agreed with the intent of this policy option and described a three- to six-month window as reasonable. Overall, the consensus was that shortening the statute of limitations would help ensure earlier resolution of disputes and reduce project uncertainty.

Policy Option 18: Restrict standing to parties who submitted substantive, detailed comments during the public comment period.

Under current law, individuals and organizations can file NEPA lawsuits even if they did not participate during the public comment process. The SPEED Act would limit standing to parties that submitted unique, substantive, and detailed comments during the public comment period, raised the same issues in litigation, and can demonstrate direct harm.

Participants generally agreed that linking standing to participation during the public comment process could reduce unnecessary litigation and promote earlier engagement. Many pointed to the Fast-41 permitting framework as precedent for this type of reform but affirmed that the SPEED Act’s version appears more restrictive. Several participants warned that requiring both detailed comments and proof of harm could disadvantage smaller organizations, tribes, or under-resourced communities that lack the capacity to produce highly technical submissions. Others supported the idea in principle but said the timing of public comment opportunities, particularly if limited to the notice of intent stage, could further constrain meaningful participation. Overall, many participants supported the intention of this policy option but agreed that the current language may need to be adjusted to ensure communities can still access judicial review.

Conclusion

To improve the permitting process, roundtable participants agreed on the need to reform NEPA and judicial review. And participants mostly agreed that the SPEED Act’s policy options seek to solve real problems in the current system. Some of these options enjoyed consensus support, but others did not. Most importantly, participants agreed that improvements to NEPA and judicial review are necessary components of a broader permitting reform package that is also likely to include other key policies, such as project certainty and improvements to permitting for transmission and other linear infrastructure.

This roundtable builds on BPC’s ongoing work to develop pragmatic, bipartisan permitting solutions. Following this discussion on the SPEED Act’s NEPA and judicial review provisions, BPC will next convene a roundtable focused on project certainty and predictability, with a focus on the objective of ensuring that all project types are treated fairly and consistently across presidential administrations.",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Judge-Immigration-Backlog.png,N,,2025-11-17 16:00:53.038127

Under the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals must obtain a permit from the E.P.A.
A 2023 Supreme Court decision had set the stage for the E.P.A.’s action by curtailing the agency’s power to police millions of acres of wetlands.
E.P.A., Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Clean Water Act allowed the agency to regulate only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a “relatively permanent” body of water.
These changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.","The Trump administration proposed on Monday to significantly limit the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to limit pollution in wetlands, rivers and other bodies of water across the country.

The proposed rule could strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, potentially threatening sources of clean drinking water for millions of Americans. It was a victory for a range of business interests that have lobbied to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, including farmers, home builders, real estate developers, oil drillers and petrochemical manufacturers.

“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, other landowners and governments,” said Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, during an event at the agency’s headquarters in Washington featuring Republican members of Congress and industry executives.

Under the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals must obtain a permit from the E.P.A. before releasing pollutants into the nation’s waterways. They must receive a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before discharging any dredged or fill material, such as sand, silt or construction debris.

A 2023 Supreme Court decision had set the stage for the E.P.A.’s action by curtailing the agency’s power to police millions of acres of wetlands. In the majority opinion in Sackett v. E.P.A., Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Clean Water Act allowed the agency to regulate only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to a “relatively permanent” body of water.

But Justice Alito did not explicitly define a “relatively permanent” body of water. Now, the Trump administration is describing it as a body of water that flows either year-round or during the “wet season.”

The new definition would exclude wetlands that abut or touch many intermittent streams, which do not flow during dry periods. It also could exclude ephemeral streams, which sit dry for much of the year and fill up only after rainfall or snowmelt.

These changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

“The administration is preparing to rip away protections from the vast majority of wetlands in the United States, which are the waters that protect our communities from floods, help filter drinking water and provide habitat for millions of birds and fish,” said Andrew Wetzler, senior vice president for nature at N.R.D.C.

Ephemeral streams can be small, but a recent study found that they provided about 55 percent of the water flowing through most river systems used in drinking water supplies.

“This rule will mean more unsafe drinking water and more expensive water treatment costs for taxpayers,” said Jim Murphy, senior director of legal advocacy at the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.

The National Association of Home Builders, an industry trade group, praised the Trump administration’s proposal, saying it would slash costs for builders and developers, potentially lowering the price of new homes. “This is a significant step toward reducing regulatory red tape, cutting permitting costs and lowering the cost of doing business in communities across the country — all while continuing to protect our nation’s vital waterways,” Buddy Hughes, chairman of the association, said in a statement.

Representative Bruce Westerman, Republican of Arkansas and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, said the proposal would help fix a “broken” permitting process in the United States. “We’re losing our ability to build things here in America,” he said at the E.P.A. event.

Ever since Congress passed the Clean Water Act to protect all “waters of the United States,” policymakers in Washington have been squabbling over how, exactly, to define those bodies of water.

In 2015, the Obama administration widened the law’s scope to cover smaller streams and headwaters. Several Republican-led states challenged the rule in court as an example of regulatory overreach, leading a federal judge to pause its implementation.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, the E.P.A. repealed the Obama-era rule and issued a weaker version. Then in 2023 the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. E.P.A., dealing a setback to the Biden administration’s efforts to again strengthen the regulation.

The Sackett case concerned an Idaho couple, Michael and Chantell Sackett, who sought to build a house on what an appeals court called “a soggy residential lot” near a lake. The E.P.A. determined that there were wetlands on the property, and it ordered the couple to stop construction or risk paying fines of more than $40,000 per day.

The Sacketts, represented by the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, sued. The case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that the couple’s 0.63-acre lot — and other properties like it nationwide — was not subject to federal oversight.

“This proposed rule is significant not just for small landowners like the Sacketts, but for all sectors of the regulated community, whether it’s agriculture or home construction or industrial development,” said Damien Schiff, a senior attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation.

After the proposal is published in the Federal Register, the E.P.A. will solicit public comments for 45 days before finalizing the rule.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/08/multimedia/00cli-cleanwater-mkqh/00cli-cleanwater-mkqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 16:00:57.376217

Waterkeeper Alliance is sounding the alarm about the newly announced draft rule from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army to revise the definition of the “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), which further undermines landmark clean water protections, threatening water quality across the United States.

By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life.

The Clean Water Act has already been severely weakened following the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, in which the Court dramatically revoked protections for thousands of bodies of water across the country. This new draft rule takes these rollbacks even further and follows EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plans earlier this year to revise wastewater regulations for coal-burning power plants, roll back coal ash management regulations, and reconsider the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. He has also withdrawn standards that could have cleaned up water pollution from slaughterhouses, announced plans to weaken PFAS drinking water standards, and ordered the closure of EPA offices responsible for addressing disproportionate pollution in low-income and rural communities and communities of color.

Collectively, these actions threaten to reverse more than five decades of progress to reduce highly toxic and dangerous pollutants from the environment and protect critical water resources from dangerous development projects.

“Every rollback threatens the water we drink, the rivers we fish, and the wetlands that protect our communities and ecosystems,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, Senior Attorney for Waterkeeper Alliance. “EPA’s new draft WOTUS rule continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country. This isn’t abstract policy, it’s a deliberate decision that disregards the real consequences for people’s health, safety, and daily lives.

“Our findings paint a grim picture: a toxic combination of increasing energy prices, rising overdue balances, and squeezed household budgets that together are pushing families deeper and deeper into debt,” The Century Foundation wrote.

“Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.”

Late balances for utility bills outpaced inflation 2.7 times during the studied period, according to the think tank. It said that Black families were three times more likely to have an overdue balance than white ones, noting that Black and Asian households also had the highest late bills.

“Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance,” The Century Foundation explained.

Late balances for families with well-below-average credit scores increased by 30% during the studied period, the organization added. Those households were disproportionately in urban and low-income neighborhoods, according to the think tank.

“These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation – and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill,” The Century Foundation said. “Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.”

The organization accused the Trump administration of failing to address the root causes of “energy inflation” and hindering the development of renewable energy.

President Donald Trump has targeted renewable energy projects by reducing federal support for them. He has said that sources like wind and solar are unreliable and worse options than oil and gas, which he claims are more beneficial for the economy.

The first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order to protect the country’s “economic and national security” and “military preparedness” by making sure an “abundant” supply of reliable energy was available in every state.

“It is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years,” the president said. “It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.”",https://wsbt.com/resources/media/5f1f45d9-e3d0-4bcb-9bca-575bccbe40ee-GettyImages2165132907.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 17:02:27.383892

Toyota’s new US battery plant is set for an expansion

The first batteries rolled off the production line at Toyota’s new battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, last Wednesday, marking a “pivotal moment” in the automaker’s nearly 70-year history in the US.

Toyota’s new plant houses 14 battery production lines, which will be used to power battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrids (HEVs), and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

At full capacity, the battery plant can produce 30 GWh per year. The plant is phasing in batteries imported from Japan through a joint venture with LG Electronics, which will power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, and RAV4 HEV. It also ships hybrid battery modules to its Kentucky assembly plant and to another plant in Alabama, which it co-owns with Mazda.

Toyota’s battery plant is already massive, spanning about 121 football fields, but company executives are saying it will likely be even bigger than expected.

“Our plans are to go 70% electrified by 2030. So obviously that could fuel additional expansion here at the plant,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said during a media briefing on Wednesday (via Triad Business Journal) following a tour of the facility.

Building on its commitment, Toyota announced an additional $10 billion investment over the next five years in electrified mobility.

Toyota didn’t say exactly how it plans to invest the $10 billion, but the new battery plant is likely to see some of it. The battery modules that Toyota produces at the plant vary from hybrid to EV, but the cells are the same, enabling it to adjust based on demand.

It can also adapt to different battery types, which could possibly include solid-state batteries, according to Toyota’s plant president, Don Stewart.

Toyota, which has been one of the biggest laggards in the shift to all-electric vehicles, will continue pushing hybrids as it aims to overcome the new US tariffs.

The plant can supply batteries for around 600,000 hybrid vehicles a year while Toyota builds capacity for another 74,000 PHEVs and 45,000 EVs, including its first three-row electric SUV.

Starting next year, Toyota’s best-selling vehicle, the RAV4, will be sold exclusively as a hybrid. Toyota is also launching several new BEVs, including the C-HR and BZ Woodlands electric SUVs, as well as the 2026 electric Lexus ES.

Electrek’s Take

It’s not a surprise to see Toyota standing by hybrids at this point. What will be interesting is to see how Toyota’s new electric vehicles sell.

After solving many of the issues with its first EV, the bZ4X, will Toyota’s upcoming models sell? Several EVs, like the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and Chevy Equinox EV, have proven that an affordable electric car with enough range and features will sell.

With longer driving ranges, faster charging, and an improved interior and exterior design, Toyota’s upcoming electric vehicles are already a significant upgrade over the outgoing bZ4X. If Toyota sees EV sales improve, we could see production plans at the facility shift once again.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/Toyota-EV-battery-plant-bigger-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:59.558254

The electric vehicle industry's quest for supply chain independence faces ongoing hurdles as Syrah Resources and Tesla navigate their complex graphite supply partnership. The Australian mining company recently announced its second deadline extension in two months, pushing the material qualification timeline to January 16, 2026, highlighting the technical complexities of establishing domestic battery material production. This Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal extension underscores the broader challenges facing critical minerals energy transition as automakers work to reduce dependence on Chinese-dominated markets.

This development demonstrates the broader challenges facing critical mineral supply chains as automakers work to reduce dependence on Chinese-dominated markets while establishing reliable domestic processing capabilities for electric vehicle batteries.

Understanding the Default Notice and Contractual Timeline Adjustments

Tesla issued a default notice in July 2024 regarding Syrah's alleged failure to deliver conforming active anode material samples from its Louisiana processing facility. The original September 16, 2024 cure date has now been extended twice, first to November 15, 2024, and subsequently to January 16, 2026.

Despite these extensions, Syrah maintains its position that it has not defaulted on the agreement terms. The company stated that while it does not accept being in default under the offtake agreement, both parties agreed to extend the cure date to provide additional time for material qualification.

The technical requirements center on delivering battery-grade active anode material that meets Tesla's specific conformance standards for electric vehicle battery integration. This involves transforming natural graphite from Syrah's Mozambique operations into processed material suitable for lithium-ion battery anodes at the Vidalia facility in Louisiana.

Critical Milestones and Final Qualification Requirements

The contractual framework establishes February 9, 2026 as the ultimate termination trigger date for Tesla. If final qualification of the plant's active anode material is not achieved by this date, Tesla retains the right to terminate the entire offtake agreement.

This creates a narrow window of approximately 24 days between the extended cure date and potential contract termination, indicating limited flexibility for further negotiations if qualification targets are not met. The material testing standards required for electric vehicle battery integration involve complex quality control benchmarks that must demonstrate consistent performance characteristics.

Strategic Importance of Domestic Graphite Supply Development

The partnership between Syrah Resources and Tesla represents a significant strategic initiative to establish domestic battery material production capacity. The 2021 contract commits to supplying 8,000 metric tons of graphite anode materials over a four-year period, translating to approximately 2,000 metric tons annually.

Breaking China's Market Dominance in Battery Materials

Syrah's Vidalia facility holds unique strategic value as the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer outside China. This positioning directly addresses the challenge of Chinese supplies that dominate the global graphite anode market, creating supply chain vulnerabilities for Western electric vehicle manufacturers.

The facility's vertical integration means it combines both raw graphite processing and active anode material production in a single location, providing operational advantages over multi-stage processing arrangements that span different geographic regions. This integration model reduces logistical complexity and provides greater quality control throughout the production process.

Tesla's Multi-Sourcing Approach to Critical Components

Tesla's engagement with Syrah reflects a broader strategy to diversify critical battery component sourcing beyond traditional Chinese suppliers. This approach serves multiple objectives:

Risk mitigation through geographic distribution of suppliers

Supply chain transparency and quality control advantages

Long-term battery cost reduction through competitive sourcing

Alignment with U.S. policy objectives for domestic manufacturing

The partnership also demonstrates Tesla's commitment to supporting the development of domestic critical mineral processing infrastructure, even when technical qualification timelines extend beyond initial projections. Furthermore, companies are increasingly looking toward innovative solutions like the recent battery recycling breakthrough to enhance sustainability across the battery supply chain.

Technical Challenges in Natural Graphite Processing Operations

The transformation from raw graphite to battery-grade anode material involves complex processing requirements that present significant technical hurdles. Syrah must convert natural graphite extracted from its Balama operations in Mozambique into conforming active anode material that meets Tesla's lithium-ion battery specifications.

Complex Processing Requirements for Battery Integration

Active anode material production requires precise control of particle size distribution, surface chemistry, and electrochemical properties. The material must demonstrate consistent performance characteristics including:

Stable capacity retention over charge-discharge cycles

Appropriate electrical conductivity for lithium-ion insertion

Chemical purity standards for battery safety requirements

Structural integrity under operational stress conditions

The repeated deadline extensions suggest these technical specifications are more challenging to achieve consistently at commercial scale than initially anticipated. Quality specifications for lithium-ion battery applications involve stringent testing protocols that verify material performance under various operational conditions.

Geographic Integration Challenges Across Continents

Syrah manages a geographically distributed operation that spans Mozambique mining operations and Louisiana processing facilities. This arrangement requires reliable logistics coordination and quality control across international boundaries, creating additional complexity compared to single-region operations.

The integration between Balama graphite extraction and Vidalia processing involves maintaining material consistency throughout the supply chain, from raw ore extraction through final anode material production. Transportation logistics, quality preservation during shipping, and coordination between facilities on different continents add operational risk factors.

Impact of Operational Disruptions on Supply Chain Reliability

Recent operational challenges have demonstrated the vulnerability of geographically distributed critical mineral supply chains to political and economic instability. Syrah's operations faced significant disruptions in 2024 due to nationwide protests in Mozambique, affecting the Balama graphite extraction facility.

Mozambique Political Instability and Mining Operations

The Balama facility experienced operational disruptions during 2024 nationwide protests in Mozambique, highlighting the political risk factors associated with African mining operations. These disruptions affected raw material supply to the Louisiana processing facility, creating additional challenges for meeting Tesla's material qualification timeline.

To address these operational challenges, Syrah received $8.5 million under its United States International Development Finance Corporation loan facility in November 2024. This disbursement represents partial access to a total $150 million commitment designed to support operational stability at the Balama operations.

Financial Support Mechanisms and Strategic Importance

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's $150 million loan commitment reflects institutional recognition of the strategic importance of Balama operations to U.S. battery supply chain resilience. This government backing demonstrates policy-level support for establishing alternative sources of critical battery materials.

The DFC financing serves multiple purposes:

Providing working capital for sustained mining operations

Supporting operational improvements and expansion capabilities

Demonstrating U.S. government commitment to supply chain diversification

Creating financial incentives for continued Mozambique operations despite political risks

Consequently, this financial support aligns with broader initiatives such as Australia's critical minerals strategic reserve to ensure supply chain security.

Market Implications of Repeated Timeline Extensions

The pattern of deadline extensions creates market uncertainty regarding both Tesla's battery supply planning and Syrah's operational execution capabilities. The progression from September 2024 to January 2026 represents a timeline extension of approximately 16 months beyond the original cure date.

Electric Vehicle Industry Supply Chain Planning

Tesla's battery production planning must account for potential delays or termination of the Syrah supply agreement. If the January 16, 2026 deadline is missed, Tesla faces the loss of a committed 2,000 metric tons annually from its graphite anode material supply planning by February 9, 2026.

This scenario would require Tesla to secure alternative graphite anode sourcing, potentially from Chinese suppliers that the partnership was designed to replace. Alternative sourcing options may involve different technical specifications, pricing structures, or supply chain risk profiles that affect overall battery production costs.

Investor Sentiment and Operational Execution Concerns

The repeated extensions signal to investors that establishing large-scale critical mineral processing facilities involves longer development timelines than initially projected. This pattern may affect investor confidence in similar domestic battery material development projects across the industry.

Market participants are likely monitoring several key factors:

Technical progress indicators from the Vidalia facility

Financial performance of both Balama and Louisiana operations

Alternative partnership opportunities for both companies

Broader industry timeline expectations for new facility qualification

Broader Context for U.S. Battery Manufacturing Independence

The Tesla-Syrah partnership represents part of a larger strategic initiative to establish domestic battery material production capabilities that reduce dependence on Chinese-controlled supply chains. This effort aligns with broader U.S. policy objectives for critical mineral supply security.

Domestic Critical Mineral Processing Development

The Vidalia facility's role as the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer outside China positions it as a critical component of U.S. battery manufacturing infrastructure. Successful qualification would demonstrate the viability of establishing domestic processing capabilities for critical battery materials.

Government policy support through mechanisms like the DFC financing creates favourable conditions for domestic critical mineral development. This support reflects recognition that battery material supply chain independence requires patient capital investment and technical development timelines that exceed typical commercial project horizons.

For instance, similar initiatives in other regions include India's development of a battery-grade lithium refinery to support regional battery production capabilities.

Competitive Positioning in Global Battery Materials

The success or failure of the Tesla-Syrah partnership will influence future domestic battery material development initiatives. Successful qualification would validate the technical and economic viability of establishing U.S.-based anode material production, potentially encouraging additional investment in similar facilities.

Conversely, contract termination would highlight the challenges of competing with established Chinese battery material suppliers and may discourage similar domestic development projects. The outcome carries implications beyond the specific partnership for broader U.S. battery manufacturing competitiveness.

Key Performance Indicators Through Final Deadline

Industry observers and investors should monitor several critical performance indicators leading up to the January 16, 2026 deadline and potential February 9, 2026 termination trigger.

Material Qualification Progress Metrics

The most critical factor is Syrah's progress in achieving Tesla's material qualification requirements. This involves demonstrating that active anode material from the Vidalia facility consistently meets performance specifications for Tesla's lithium-ion battery applications.

Key technical milestones include:

Successful completion of material conformance testing

Demonstration of consistent production quality at target volumes

Integration testing with Tesla's battery manufacturing processes

Long-term performance validation under operational conditions

Financial and Operational Stability Indicators

Syrah's financial performance and operational stability at both Balama and Vidalia facilities will influence its ability to meet qualification requirements. The company's utilisation of the $150 million DFC loan facility and progress in addressing 2024 operational disruptions provide important context for operational execution capabilities.

Production volume consistency metrics will demonstrate whether the Vidalia facility can reliably produce 2,000 metric tons annually of qualified material. This involves both technical capability validation and operational process optimisation.

Strategic Lessons for Critical Mineral Supply Chain Development

The Tesla-Syrah partnership provides valuable insights into the complexities of establishing domestic critical mineral processing capabilities. The extended qualification timeline demonstrates that developing large-scale battery material production involves technical challenges that exceed initial planning assumptions.

Realistic Timeline Planning for New Facility Development

The progression from a 2021 contract initiation to 2024-2026 qualification extensions illustrates the time required to establish and qualify new critical mineral processing facilities. This timeline reality should inform future project planning for similar domestic battery material development initiatives.

Patient capital investment, such as the $150 million DFC commitment, appears necessary to support the extended development timelines required for critical mineral processing facility qualification. Commercial financing alone may not provide sufficient flexibility for the technical development requirements involved.

Moreover, the mining industry is witnessing transformative changes as EV mining transformation initiatives reshape traditional operations and create new efficiency opportunities.

Risk Management for Geographically Distributed Operations

The 2024 Mozambique disruptions highlight the importance of political risk assessment and mitigation strategies for critical mineral supply chains that span multiple continents. Geographic diversification provides supply security benefits but requires robust risk management frameworks.

Successful management of distributed operations requires coordination capabilities, quality control systems, and financial resources that support operations across different regulatory and political environments.

Long-Term Outlook for Domestic Battery Material Production

The Tesla-Syrah partnership outcome will influence future domestic battery material development strategies regardless of whether final qualification is achieved by the January 16, 2026 deadline.

Potential for Expanded Collaboration Beyond Current Agreement

Successful qualification could create opportunities for expanded collaboration between Tesla and Syrah beyond the current 8,000 metric ton commitment. Tesla's growing battery production requirements may support additional volume commitments if the Vidalia facility demonstrates reliable production capabilities.

Expanded partnerships could involve technology sharing, additional processing capacity development, or integration of other battery material processing capabilities at the Louisiana facility.

Contribution to U.S. Battery Supply Chain Security

The partnership represents a foundational initiative for establishing U.S. battery material supply chain independence. Success would validate the technical and economic viability of domestic anode material production, potentially encouraging additional investment in similar facilities.

The broader contribution to global electric vehicle adoption acceleration depends on establishing reliable, cost-competitive domestic battery material production that reduces dependence on geopolitically concentrated supply sources. However, recent market developments indicate the ongoing challenges faced by companies attempting to establish alternative supply chains.

What Does the Future Hold for This Partnership?

As we approach the critical January 16, 2026 deadline, the Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal extension continues to represent more than just a bilateral commercial agreement. It symbolises the broader challenges and opportunities in establishing resilient, domestic critical mineral supply chains.

The success of this partnership could serve as a blueprint for future collaborations, while its potential failure would provide valuable lessons about the complexities of competing with established Chinese suppliers. Furthermore, the extended timelines reflect the reality that building new critical mineral processing capabilities requires patience, substantial investment, and technical expertise that cannot be rushed.

The outcome will undoubtedly influence policy decisions, investor confidence, and strategic planning across the entire electric vehicle and battery manufacturing ecosystem. As the Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal extension progresses toward its final resolution, industry stakeholders continue to watch closely for indicators of success or failure that will shape the future of domestic battery material production.

This strategic partnership between Australia's Syrah Resources and the electric vehicle giant represents more than a simple contract modification—it's a critical test of whether Western companies can successfully challenge Chinese dominance in battery material processing. Furthermore, the outcome will likely influence investment decisions across the critical minerals & energy security sector for years to come.

Background of the Strategic Partnership

The collaboration between Syrah Resources and Tesla forms a cornerstone of North America's drive toward battery supply chain independence. This partnership focuses on Syrah's Louisiana-based Vidalia facility, which holds the unique distinction of being the Western Hemisphere's only large-scale, vertically integrated graphite anode material production plant operating outside Chinese control.

Unlike Chinese facilities that benefit from extensive integrated supply ecosystems and lower operational costs, Syrah's facility offers strategic advantages including proximity to North American battery manufacturers, compliance with Western environmental and labour standards, and reduced shipping costs for regional customers. The facility represents a critical test case for establishing competitive graphite processing operations outside China's dominant market position.

The timeline of extensions reveals the complexity of meeting Tesla's stringent qualification requirements. The original September 16, 2025 deadline has undergone two extensions within a two-month period, demonstrating both companies' commitment to resolving technical challenges rather than terminating the strategically important relationship.

Milestone Original Date Current Extended Date Significance Initial Cure Deadline September 16, 2025 January 16, 2026 Final opportunity to address compliance issues First Extension Period N/A November 15, 2025 Initial extension attempt Final Qualification N/A February 9, 2026 Last chance for material certification Contract Volume 4-year period 8,000 metric tonnes Total graphite anode material commitment

The extension structure involves two distinct phases: a cure period ending January 16, 2026, during which Syrah must address alleged compliance deficiencies, and a final qualification phase with a hard deadline of February 9, 2026. Tesla retains contractual termination rights if final qualification is not achieved by the February deadline.

Why Did Tesla Issue a Default Notice Against Syrah?

Tesla's default notification in July 2025 stemmed from technical non-conformity issues rather than contractual breaches related to payment or timeline violations. The automaker determined that Syrah's Louisiana facility failed to deliver active anode material samples that met Tesla's rigorous battery specifications.

This technical hurdle extends beyond simple quality control challenges, highlighting the complex engineering requirements necessary for electric vehicle battery components. The qualification process demands that Syrah's Louisiana-produced graphite demonstrate:

• Consistent electrochemical performance metrics across production batches

• Thermal stability characteristics under battery operating conditions

• Particle size distribution specifications within Tesla's precise tolerances

• Material purity levels that ensure long-term battery reliability and safety

Notably, Syrah disputes being in default under the agreement while simultaneously working with Tesla to extend compliance deadlines. This approach suggests both companies recognise the mutual strategic value of maintaining the partnership despite current technical challenges.

Industry Insight: Active anode material qualification in automotive battery manufacturing typically involves months of testing across multiple performance parameters, making rapid qualification extremely challenging for new suppliers entering established supply chains.

How Does This Extension Impact Tesla's Battery Supply Chain Strategy?

Tesla's partnership with Syrah aligns with broader Western efforts to diversify critical mineral supply chains away from Chinese dominance. Currently, China controls approximately 60% of global graphite processing capacity, making alternative sources like Syrah's Vidalia plant strategically valuable for supply chain resilience.

The 8,000 metric tonnes annual commitment represents a significant portion of Tesla's North American battery production requirements. Successfully qualifying this supply source would provide Tesla with several strategic advantages:

• Enhanced supply chain resilience against geopolitical disruptions

• Reduced dependency on Chinese critical mineral suppliers

• Potential cost advantages through domestic sourcing and shorter logistics chains

• Alignment with U.S. government incentives for domestic critical mineral processing

The arrangement also supports Tesla's broader strategy of vertical integration and supply chain control, particularly crucial as the company scales Model 3 and Model Y production at its North American facilities. However, the technical challenges highlight the difficulties Western companies face in establishing competitive alternatives to established Chinese supply chains, especially considering the US-China trade war impacts on global markets.

What Are the Financial Stakes for Syrah Resources?

The financial implications for Syrah Resources extend far beyond the immediate Tesla contract. The company recently secured $8.5 million from its $150 million United States International Development Finance Corporation loan facility, demonstrating continued government backing for the integrated supply chain strategy.

Financial Impact Analysis:

Metric Amount Significance Recent Capital Injection $8.5 million Immediate operational support Total USIDF Loan Facility $150 million Long-term project financing Estimated Annual Contract Value $40-60 million Based on current market pricing Four-Year Total Revenue Potential $160-240 million Full contract value realisation

The USIDF funding supports both the Louisiana operations and Syrah's Balama graphite mining operations in Mozambique, which experienced significant disruptions during 2024 due to civil unrest. This integrated financing structure underscores the strategic importance U.S. development finance institutions place on establishing Western-controlled critical mineral supply chains.

Stock Market Implications

The extension provides Syrah with breathing room to address technical challenges while maintaining investor confidence in the Tesla partnership's viability. Australian investors closely monitor how this Syrah Tesla graphite supply agreement extension affects the company's market position. Failure to meet the February 2026 deadline could result in significant stock price volatility and force strategic repositioning of the company's North American operations.

The Tesla contract represents more than revenue potential; it provides validation for Syrah's technology and manufacturing capabilities, potentially opening doors to additional North American battery manufacturers seeking supply chain diversification.

How Does Syrah's Vidalia Facility Compare Globally?

Syrah's Louisiana plant occupies a unique position in the global graphite processing landscape as the only large-scale, vertically integrated anode material facility operating outside Chinese control in the Western Hemisphere.

Facility Specifications and Capabilities:

• Processing Capacity: Designed for 18,000 tonnes annual production at full capacity

• Integration Level: Complete processing from natural graphite to battery-ready anode material

• Quality Systems: Automotive-grade quality control and certification capabilities

• Current Utilisation: Approximately 44% of design capacity based on Tesla commitment

This positioning creates both significant competitive advantages and operational challenges. Unlike Chinese facilities that benefit from integrated supply chains and economies of scale, Syrah's facility offers proximity to North American markets and compliance with Western regulatory standards.

Competitive Landscape Analysis

The facility's success or failure will likely influence future investment decisions in critical mineral processing facilities outside China. Success could validate the viability of establishing competitive graphite processing operations in North America, particularly as EVs transforming mining operations globally demand secure supply chains.

Chinese competitors typically benefit from established supplier networks, lower labour costs, and integrated supply chain ecosystems that provide significant cost advantages. Syrah must overcome these structural disadvantages through technological innovation, supply chain efficiency, and strategic customer relationships like the Tesla partnership.

What Are the Broader Industry Implications?

The Syrah Tesla graphite supply agreement extension represents far more than a simple contract modification. It embodies the challenges and opportunities facing Western efforts to establish independent battery material supply chains in an industry dominated by Chinese suppliers.

Critical Minerals Strategy Impact

The partnership serves as a real-world test of whether Western companies can successfully challenge Chinese dominance in battery material processing. The technical requirements, capital investments, and qualification timelines demonstrate the complexity of establishing alternative supply sources, especially as Australia's critical minerals reserve becomes increasingly important for global supply security.

Electric Vehicle Supply Chain Security

Success would encourage additional investment in non-Chinese graphite processing facilities, potentially creating a template for other Western companies seeking to establish independent critical mineral supply chains. Government development finance institutions and private investors are closely watching the outcome.

The extension reflects broader industry challenges including:

• Technical complexity of achieving automotive-grade material specifications

• Capital intensity required for establishing competitive processing facilities

• Time requirements for qualification processes in established supply chains

• Economic viability questions for Western-based critical mineral processing

What Happens If Syrah Meets the February 2026 Deadline?

Successful qualification by February 9, 2026 would enable Syrah to transition from pre-commercial testing to commercial production shipments under the 2021 agreement. This milestone would validate multiple strategic assumptions about Western battery material supply chain development.

Commercial Production Pathway

Meeting the deadline would trigger several positive outcomes for both companies:

• Immediate production ramp-up to contracted 8,000 tonne annual volumes

• Validation of facility capabilities for automotive-grade anode material production

• Potential contract expansion beyond initial volume commitments

• Market credibility for Syrah with other North American battery manufacturers

Industry Precedent Setting

Success could establish a template for other Western companies seeking to challenge Chinese dominance in battery material processing. The validation would likely attract additional government support and private investment for similar projects across North America and Europe.

The achievement would demonstrate that Western facilities can compete technically with Chinese suppliers, potentially reshaping investment flows in critical mineral processing infrastructure globally. Furthermore, the success could complement recent developments such as the Chinese battery recycling breakthrough by creating a more balanced global supply ecosystem.

What Are the Risks If the Deadline Is Missed?

Tesla retains contractual termination rights if final qualification is not achieved by February 9, 2026. This scenario would force Syrah to reassess the Vidalia facility's commercial viability and seek alternative market strategies.

Contract Termination Consequences

Failure to meet the deadline would result in several immediate challenges:

• Loss of anchor customer representing significant revenue potential

• Facility underutilisation with only 44% capacity currently committed

• Potential covenant violations on the $150 million USIDF loan facility

• Market credibility damage affecting relationships with other potential customers

Strategic Alternatives

Even with Tesla termination, Syrah could pursue alternative strategies including:

• Secondary battery manufacturers with potentially less stringent specifications

• Industrial applications for graphite anode materials

• Export markets leveraging the facility's strategic location

• Facility restructuring to reduce fixed costs and improve economic viability

However, these alternatives would likely operate at lower pricing and volume levels than the Tesla contract originally offered, potentially undermining the facility's long-term economic sustainability.

Market Psychology and Investment Implications

The Syrah Tesla graphite supply agreement extension reflects broader market psychology around critical mineral supply chain independence. Investors and policymakers are grappling with the trade-offs between supply chain security and economic efficiency in battery material sourcing.

Investment Strategy Considerations

The partnership outcome will likely influence investment flows in several areas:

• Western critical mineral processing facilities seeking to establish Chinese alternatives

• Government development finance for strategic supply chain initiatives

• Private equity interest in critical mineral supply chain companies

• Automotive manufacturer supply chain diversification strategies

Market participants are viewing this as a bellwether for whether Western economies can successfully establish competitive alternatives to Chinese critical mineral suppliers without significant cost premiums or performance trade-offs.

Geological and Technical Factors

The technical challenges facing Syrah highlight the complexity of graphite anode material production for automotive applications. Unlike consumer electronics batteries, automotive batteries require extremely consistent performance characteristics across temperature ranges, charging cycles, and operational conditions.

Material Quality Requirements

Automotive-grade anode materials must demonstrate:

• Particle morphology consistency affecting battery packing density

• Surface area optimisation for electrochemical performance

• Impurity control at parts-per-million levels

• Thermal expansion characteristics matching battery cell design parameters

These requirements explain why qualification processes typically require months of testing and why established suppliers like those in China maintain competitive advantages through years of production experience and process optimisation.

Conclusion: A Critical Test for Supply Chain Independence

The extended deadline between Syrah and Tesla represents more than a contract modification; it embodies the fundamental challenges facing Western efforts to establish independent battery material supply chains. The outcome will likely influence investment decisions, government policies, and strategic planning across the critical minerals sector for years to come.

Success would validate the viability of establishing competitive graphite processing operations outside China, potentially triggering increased investment in Western critical mineral processing infrastructure. It would demonstrate that technical excellence, strategic partnerships, and government support can overcome Chinese cost advantages and established supply chain networks.

Failure, however, might reinforce the narrative that Chinese suppliers maintain insurmountable advantages in critical mineral processing, potentially discouraging future Western investment in alternative supply chains and strengthening Chinese market position.

The February 9, 2026 deadline thus represents a crucial inflection point not just for Syrah and Tesla, but for the broader Western strategy of reducing dependence on Chinese critical mineral suppliers in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle market.

The Oak Park-based startup, which promised in 2023 to invest $44 million and create 237 jobs in metro Detroit, is in default of its incentives agreement with the Michigan Economic Development Corp. The company was awarded $3 million by the state to help launch its Class 4 EV and has collected about a third of the cash.

Like many other EV startups that failed to launch, Bollinger’s business case has run into major hurdles, including falling demand for its pricey vehicles following the pullback of federal EV incentives.

As of Sept. 30, Bollinger had no qualified new jobs and 50 base employees, MEDC spokeswoman Danielle Emerson said. The company has laid off employees since then, Crain’s confirmed, though it is unclear how many.

Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

Bollinger has until May 4 to cure the default by reaching job milestones and “will be required to pay back all or a portion of those funds” if it fails to do so, Emerson said.

At the same time, the company is under investigation by the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, which has received 59 claims against the company about unpaid wages or benefits, department spokesperson Keely Lovern said.

“Those claims are still open and under investigation,” Lovern said. “Because they are open investigations, we cannot comment any further.”

Bollinger Motors was put into receivership in June when founder Robert Bollinger sued the company to recoup a loan and alleged the company was broke. David Michery, CEO and chairman of Brea, Calif.-based Mullen Automotive, which acquired a controlling stake in Bollinger in 2022, paid the founder back and promised to do the same for suppliers.

After emerging from receivership, Michery merged Bollinger Motors with Mullen to create Bollinger Innovations and consolidated operations to metro Detroit. He struck a resilient note during an interview in June, vowing that Bollinger Motors was here to stay.

A half-dozen suppliers sued Bollinger earlier this year, demanding payment of more than $5 million in outstanding bills, Crain’s reported in July. Those cases have since been disposed, but six different suppliers are now suing the company in active cases, according to Oakland County Circuit Court records.

Canadian supplier Promark Electronics Inc., German supplier Thyssenkrupp AG, Brazilian supplier Metalsa, Livonia-based Testron Corp., Troy-based Engineering Technology Associates Inc. and California-based Aibond Corp. are the plaintiffs in those cases.

Bollinger Innovations was delisted from the Nasdaq a month ago after failing to meet its market value requirements. Michery tried to remain in compliance by conducting nine reverse stock splits in three years, but its share value continually fell below the $1 minimum. The company is trading stock on the open markets at 13 cents per share as of Monday afternoon.

The company incurred a net loss of $304.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, according to the most recent financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August. Its accumulated deficit at the time was $2.6 billion.

MESA, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Verra Mobility Corporation (NASDAQ: VRRM), a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, announced today the results of a new survey of 2,000 Americans who regularly use toll roads.

The survey examined Americans' perceptions of the various programs that fund roads and infrastructure.

The survey results can be downloaded by visiting www.verramobility.com/survey-ruc-road-usage-charging-toll-roads.

One of the main sources of funds to improve roads and bridges in the U.S. since 1932 has been the federal gas tax, which currently adds 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. Since the rise in electric vehicle (EV) sales, the gas tax revenue has been slowly declining. For example, in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Petroleum Association reported an estimated drop in state gas tax revenue of $250 million when comparing 2024 to 2019.

The survey found:

Americans believe that roads are in need of improvements, with 93% of survey respondents stating that the infrastructure in their state needs to be improved.

When asked what they believed was the best way to recoup these funds, 73% of Americans answered that EV owners should have to pay an 'energy tax'.

""The U.S. is experiencing a fundamental shift in how we fund infrastructure improvements and expansions,"" said Stacey Moser, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Verra Mobility's Commercial Services business. ""Toll roads, and more recently, initiatives like New York City's congestion pricing program, have demonstrated that user-based funding models can be highly effective. These models generate reliable revenue but also offer drivers faster, safer and more reliable travel.""

One alternative is toll roads, which are currently utilized in many U.S. states. The U.S. tolling market was valued at approximately $12.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $18.6 billion by 2030.

The study asked several questions on Americans' perceptions of toll roads, finding that:

67% of respondents said they believed toll roads were fairer than taxes

76% believed paying tolls is acceptable if the revenue is being used to improve the quality and safety of roads and bridges

72% believe everyone should pay the same for toll roads

75% believe that tolls should be the same regardless of time of day

65% said they would be more willing to pay tolls if they knew revenue was dedicated to infrastructure projects that directly benefited them

67% believe tolls should go away once a project is paid for

When asked directly if they were generally in favor of toll roads as a way to fund transportation projects, 51% were in favor, 30% were neutral and 20% were against. These numbers were slightly more favorable than when asked about other road use pricing models:

41% were in favor of road usage charging, with 33% being neutral and 25% against

41% were in favor of congestion pricing, with 31% being neutral and 28% against

""This evolution will have a significant impact on drivers and, even more so, on fleet operators, who must navigate a complex network of tolling authorities and payment schemes while staying compliant,"" continued Moser. ""As one of the largest payers of tolls in the country, Verra Mobility has a unique perspective on how these programs are rolled out and scaled. With many new funding models now emerging to address the decline in traditional gas tax revenues, we wanted to better understand how Americans view these changes, and this survey provides important insight into public sentiment.""

For more than 15 years, Verra Mobility has helped fleet owners and operators manage toll payments quickly and easily. Each year, the company processes over 300 million tolls and violations for more than seven million vehicles worldwide. By automatically paying tolls and preventing costly fines, Verra Mobility helps drivers stay on the move while saving businesses time and money. Its technology connects each toll to the right vehicle and driver, ensuring accurate, reliable billing and seamless travel across a growing network of toll roads.

Survey Methodology The data was derived from a survey by Verra Mobility conducted online via Pollfish on June 25, 2025. Two thousand Americans who reside in states that utilize toll roads were surveyed to ensure more awareness on alternative means of raising funds for road projects. The states included were California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.

The Just Transition Work Programme

The Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP) was established by the UN in 2022 as a response to long-standing calls to ensure that climate action is fair, inclusive, and equitable. Negotiators at COP30 have a chance to ensure the JTWP becomes a vehicle for real justice — one that does not simply describe a just transition but creates the systems and rules needed to deliver it.

The UNFCCC — the governing body of the international climate treaty — is the umbrella that allows countries to negotiate climate rules, commitments, and cooperation. These negotiations follow a mostly consensus-based model, meaning every Party must agree before a decision is adopted. This process is often slow, complex, and frustrating, but it is intended to ensure equity among countries with vastly different histories, responsibilities, and capacities.

The work on the Just Transition Work Programme is happening through an informal working group, or “contact group,” where negotiators review draft text line by line. Here, countries propose edits and attempt to find compromise text that all can accept. It is inside these rooms that the fate of the Just Transition Work Programme is being shaped, to determine whether it will remain a space for dialogue or evolve into a structure capable of delivering coordinated action, support, and resources that help foster a truly just transition.

For these discussions to have real impact, COP30 must move the JTWP from conversation to implementation. That means establishing a dedicated mechanism that ensures the principles agreed under the JTWP are carried forward, monitored, and enforced in future UNFCCC processes.

Earthworks is advocating for some key pieces to be included:

Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent

Indigenous Peoples must be at the forefront of solutions to the climate crisis. On Saturday, we saw Indigenous Peoples march through the streets of Belem carrying banners and signs reading “We are the answer.” The JTWP provides an opportunity to safeguard Indigenous Peoples’ rights.

Activities under the JTWP must fully respect Indigenous Peoples’ right to self-determination and the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as established in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. FPIC means Indigenous Peoples have the right to say no, yes, or yes with conditions to projects on their lands and territories. The JTWP must include a mechanism to ensure those commitments are upheld.

The JTWP must also include mechanisms protecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation and Initial Contact, such as the precautionary principle and the principle of no contact. Mining and other energy transition activities threaten the lands, health, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Insolation.

“Critical Minerals” Mining and Processing

The JTWP must include language that recognizes the impacts of so-called critical minerals. Minerals for batteries and other cleaner energy technologies are in demand. But mining and processing those minerals is causing harm to the environment and to frontline and Indigenous communities across the globe, from Brazil to Indonesia.

These risks were underscored in the principles and recommendations outlined in the report of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals, which recognized that social and environmental impacts of mining for minerals have to be addressed in order to have a truly just transition to a green economy. This includes the protection of human and labor rights, the assurance of FPIC, establishing ecological no-go zones; and a shift toward true circularity. The JTWP must establish mechanisms that ensure reliable, diversified, sustainable, transparent, and responsible supply chains.",https://earthworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/climatemarch1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:46.219824

A National Network to Strengthen Supply Chain Resilience The Iowa pilot plant is one of the first three sites in BioMADE’s emerging Pilot Plant Network, alongside projects in Minnesota and California.","BioMADE, the State of Iowa, Iowa State University (ISU), and the Iowa State University Research Park have broken ground on a pilot-scale bioindustrial manufacturing facility designed to close one of the most significant infrastructure gaps in the U.S. bioeconomy. The 15,000 sq. ft. facility—scheduled to open in 2027—will provide domestic scale-up capacity for companies developing biobased chemicals, fuels, materials, and consumer products. The investment aims to strengthen U.S. manufacturing competitiveness while creating new revenue opportunities for farmers across the Midwest.

Governor Kim Reynolds emphasized the strategic importance of the project, noting that the facility will support both commercial and defense-focused scale-up efforts.

“This facility provides innovators the space and equipment to test, scale, and bring new ideas to life—ideas that will give our military servicemembers the materials they need to keep us safe.""

The governor added that the site will help bring manufacturing back to the United States, particularly for bio-based fabrics, adhesives, plastics, and other materials that rely on Iowa-grown crops.

Accelerating Domestic Scale-Up and Reducing Overseas Dependence

The facility’s pilot-scale capabilities include 5,000- and 10,000-liter industrial fermenters, wet and dry lab space, and downstream processing equipment. These assets will support the development of a broad range of bioproducts—spanning agricultural feed inputs, industrial chemicals, plant-based ingredients, and sustainable materials. The site will also complement existing Iowa assets, such as the ISU Center for Crops Utilization Research.

Domestic capacity remains one of the most critical barriers in U.S. biomanufacturing. Many companies still rely on overseas facilities to scale production, increasing the risk of intellectual property loss and prolonging commercialization timelines. By providing pilot-to-demonstration infrastructure within the U.S., BioMADE aims to reduce those risks and strengthen national supply chain security.

Michael Holthe, performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of War for Science and Technology, underscored the national security implications, stating,

“The BioMADE Pilot Plant in Iowa is a prime example of their impact and will be vital for our nation’s long-term national and economic security.” .

Creating New Markets for American Agriculture

Iowa’s agricultural strengths make it uniquely positioned for this type of infrastructure. The state is a major producer of corn, soybeans, and sugar beets—feedstocks that can be converted into biobased fuels, lubricants, composites, thermal protection materials, foams, detergents, coatings, and a growing range of consumer products.

Wendy Wintersteen, President of Iowa State University, noted that the university’s technical expertise and existing research programs will help speed commercialization, shared,

“Iowa State excels at biobased innovations. Our cutting-edge expertise and infrastructure will help BioMADE advance the U.S. as a global leader in biomanufacturing.”

The expansion of bioprocessing capacity is expected to generate new revenue streams for farmers and rural communities. Similar initiatives in the Midwest have shown that integrating crop production directly into biomanufacturing supply chains enhances local economic resilience and reduces dependency on volatile export markets.

A National Network to Strengthen Supply Chain Resilience

The Iowa pilot plant is one of the first three sites in BioMADE’s emerging Pilot Plant Network, alongside projects in Minnesota and California. The network is intended to create a distributed, scalable set of industrial fermentation and processing hubs that can support U.S.-based production from early development through commercial demonstration.

BioMADE has committed at least $20 million to the Iowa project, with ISU contributing up to $10 million and the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) providing an additional $10 million through its Strategic Infrastructure Program. IEDA Director Debi Durham described the facility as the “missing piece” of Iowa’s biomanufacturing ecosystem, enabling the critical bridge between research and industrial-scale production.

Douglas Friedman, BioMADE CEO, stated that the project represents a foundational investment in U.S. competitiveness. “This Pilot Plant joins a network of forthcoming facilities that will establish the U.S. as a leader in the global bioeconomy,” he said.

Positioning the U.S. for the Twenty-First Century Bioeconomy

The expansion of U.S. biomanufacturing infrastructure aligns with broader national objectives around supply-chain resilience, reshoring, and low-carbon industrial development. Studies from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Academies have repeatedly highlighted the economic potential of bioindustrial production, especially in industries such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), performance materials, and biobased polymers.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251117-092053-a0b-Combine%20Harvester%20in%20an%20Agricultural%20Field.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:26.073224

The government funds would take care of their installation costs, and once installed, lower the burden of rising electricity costs, a pressing concern.

Then, Praileau heard the federal government had scrapped the $7bn Solar For All programme through which his project and other solar projects across the country were to be funded, leaving them stranded.

It is one of several federally funded renewable energy projects that have been scrapped or will end early, veering off the country’s planned shift to renewable energy, also making it harder to meet climate goals.

Praileau, Virginia programme director for Solar United Neighbors, had been helping roll out the project that received $156m in federal funds to support 7,500 low- and middle-income families with solar installation. Praileau say he was “mind blown” by the sudden withdrawal.

The federal government will also end the 30 percent tax credit for solar rooftop installation in homes this December. For businesses, these tax credits will only be available if they start construction of factories, malls or other businesses, for which the solar installations are meant, by June 2026.

The Department of Energy also withdrew $13bn in funding from a range of other renewable energy projects, including upgrading power grids, carbon-neutral cement production, and battery energy storage. The administration also ended several funding initiatives for wind energy.

President Trump has said, “We’re not going to be approving windmills unless something happens that’s an emergency.”

This could lead to a $114bn loss in delays or cancellation of wind energy projects, according to an April 2025 report by BloombergNEF.

In Florida, intake forms for 10,000 low- and middle-income households to enrol for federal subsidies to get solar units installed on their rooftops were ready when the $156m project was scrapped in August.

A resident of Miami-Dade County had told volunteers who were helping her fill in the forms to enrol for the grant that she was “scared to use power. I am scared to put on air conditioning”, because the steep rise in power costs in the state had put it out of reach for her.

Power costs in the state are up 60 percent for some residents since 2019, Heaven Campbell, Florida programme director of Solar United Neighbors, which was working on implementing the project, told Al Jazeera.

Other states have also seen varying power cost hikes due to hurricanes and the war in Ukraine, which made Russian natural gas more expensive.

Florida Power and Light, the utilities provider, has also currently made a case to increase rates further to raise nearly $10bn over the next four years, according to Florida’s Office of Public Counsel.

Solar United’s staff has tried to educate residents that not using power could get them disconnected, and reconnecting comes with a fee.

Early ending of the tax credit will mean “consumers are stuck at the mercy of utilities”, and their rising rates, says Bernadette Del Chiaro, senior vice president for California at the Environmental Working Group.

‘Rain shadow impact’

With the solar rooftop tax credits set to expire in December, there has been a scramble to install, and some solar installers say they are having to turn away customers.

“We will see the rain shadow impact of this in 2026,” Del Chiaro says, referring to a sharp drop in business and jobs that the industry is steeling itself for next year.

“This is a big plunge on the solar coaster,” says Barry Cinnamon, chief executive of Cinnamon Energy Systems, a San Francisco-based solar installation company.

Ed Murray, president of the California Solar and Storage Association, told Al Jazeera he expects the elimination of tax credits to double the payback time for installation and other costs associated with the solar units to up to 12 years.

It would also lead to job losses for thousands of skilled workers in the sector, Murray said, even as the air quality is likely to worsen and the state is expected to fail to meet its climate goals.

In its announcement withdrawing from these projects, the Department of Energy notification said the projects “advance the previous Administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda”.

In the statement, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that, “By returning these funds to the American taxpayer, the Trump administration is affirming its commitment to advancing more affordable, reliable and secure American energy and being more responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

Critics of solar projects have said they drive up costs for households still on the power grid because solar customers pay less to utilities but still use that power when needed.

The Trump administration has, instead, supported oil and gas production through several measures, including plans to open up the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil and gas leasing recently. It has also eased permitting for drilling on federal lands.

Rising costs

The Biden administration had funded renewable energy projects under what it called the Green New Deal, a programme to accelerate economic growth and job creation while having a positive climate impact.

But even as these projects began rolling out, power costs have risen sharply in many states, including Virginia.

A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the rise in power costs had outpaced inflation in 26 states and listed a range of factors for it, including the Ukraine war and extreme weather factors such as wildfires and hurricanes that have damaged an already ageing electric poles and grid.

For instance, prices in California have risen more than 34 percent since 2019, the study says, in part because the record-breaking wildfires forced utilities to replace and strengthen their power lines. Federal funding of $630m to strengthen grids in California was among the projects scrapped by the Department of Energy.

“A majority of the projects that were scrapped were mid-implementation,” says Ryan Schleeter, communications director of The Climate Center, a California-based think tank.

Federal incentives also meant that more than 20 percent of the cars sold in the state over the last two years had been electric vehicles (EVs). These allowed middle-income families to buy EVs, Schleeter says. With incentives having ended on September 30, “the central challenge will be how to be equitable,” he says.

Susan Stephenson, executive director of California Power and Light, which supports places of worship to have renewable energy, says several places of worship that had planned to move to solar energy or install EV charging stations are now struggling to find installers and have seen costs going up beyond their initial budget due to federal cuts.

In Virginia, Praileau says power costs came up as one of the greatest concerns in his interactions with his congregants. The state has among the most data centres in the country, and Praileau believes that could be a reason for rising costs.

Voter dissatisfaction over rising power costs has been among the top issues in the governor’s elections in the state that went to the polls on November 4. One of the promises that Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat candidate who won, had made was to reduce power costs by increasing energy production and getting data centres to pay a higher share of power costs.

Praileau hopes the solar project, the cuts to which are already being litigated, can also be revived by the new governor. In Florida, too, there is ongoing litigation on the federal funding cuts.

Several states, including California, have announced their own rollbacks on renewable energy incentives.

But with funding withdrawals hurting residents, Steve Larson, a former executive director of the California Public Utilities Commission, expects more litigation to restore programmes and mastering “techniques of delay”, for federal cuts in grants and to allow renewable energy projects to keep going.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP23224651571332-1763402452.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:45.516166

Case in point: progressive darling Graham Platner is running strong against Janet Mills for the Maine Senate Democratic nomination.
The starkness of this challenge is underscored by the difficulties of being truly moderate in today’s Democratic Party.
Abigail Spanberger is a moderate within the current Democratic Party, but she is not a moderate from the perspective of 1998.
Most want strong public schools and the flexibility to choose which school their children attend… [Trump’s] extremism offers an opportunity to the Democratic Party.","The Democrats have a new mantra: “affordability.” It played a starring role in Democratic gubernatorial victories in New Jersey and Virginia and in the surprising mayoral victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City. By all accounts, this was an effective message even controlling for other factors like the light blue to deep blue nature of these states and municipalities, the overrepresentation of Democratic-friendly educated, engaged voters in these elections, and the general unpopularity of President Trump.

Affordability is an area of deep vulnerability for Trump and his party since they promised to fix Biden and the Democrats’ mismanagement of the economy and are not viewed as having done so. According to Silver Bulletin’s polling aggregates, Trump’s handling of the economy is 18 points underwater (approval minus disapproval) and an astonishing 28 points underwater on handling inflation (34 percent approval vs. 62 percent disapproval). Other data show that general views of the economy have not improved since Trump took office, that most believe Trump’s policies are actually making the economy worse and that more see the economy getting worse rather than better in the coming year.

In such a situation, it would be political malpractice not to focus on this vulnerability, neatly encapsulated in the term “affordability.” Everything just costs too damn much! Democrats have taken to this approach delightedly, whether moderate or fire-breathing progressive. It provides a convenient way of changing the subject when other issues, particularly cultural ones, come up where their views are decidedly less popular. Pay no attention to those other issues: we Democrats are affordability people!

Will this work? Well, it did in 2025. Indeed, it worked so well that one Democratic commentator declared it a new “theory of everything” for the Democrats and there has been general euphoria that—finally!—a way has been found to neutralize the toxic image the party has developed over time. In short, Democrats hope to affordability-wash their party brand and be reborn as a party that cares for little beyond making ordinary citizens’ lives easier and better. But can the Democrats really wash away their political sins so easily?

There are reasons to be skeptical that affordability, despite its utility as a campaign trope, has such magical powers. Start with the ongoing struggle between moderates and progressives within the party. Their differences were temporarily suppressed during the 2025 campaigns, where everyone latched onto the affordability message, but in the aftermath these differences are coming to the fore. Mamdani’s victory in New York City has put wind in the sails of the good ship Progressive; now is not the time they say to bow “at the altar of caution.” Such candidates are running hard to the left in many Democratic primaries and Democrats could well find themselves with their own version of Republicans’ Tea Party problem from the early 2010’s where insurgents undermined GOP electoral fortunes.

Case in point: progressive darling Graham Platner is running strong against Janet Mills for the Maine Senate Democratic nomination. In past social media posts, Platner referred to himself as a communist, disparaged the police, and criticized Maine’s rural white people for being “stupid” and “racist.” And then there’s his “Totenkopf” tattoo historically associated with the Nazis. Not ideal; recent polling indicates that with this baggage Republican Susan Collins would easily vanquish him in a general election.

After balanced information about Platner, he trails Collins significantly. After a positive paragraph reflective of Platner’s bio and current campaign messaging, and a negative paragraph summarizing the recent news about him and reflecting likely Republican messaging in a general election, Collins gets above 50 percent and Platner trails her by 9 (42 percent Platner / 51 percent Collins)—the same margin by which Democrats lost the 2020 Maine Senate race.

Without flipping Collins’ seat, Democrats’ chances of taking back the Senate are extremely small. In general, Democrats are in desperate need of moderate candidates who can overcome, rather than reinforce, the negative weight of the party’s image—an image which cannot be magically affordability-washed away in purple-to-red states. This imperative is underscored by this chart from Lakshya Jain on how Democrats would do in Senate contests outside of Maine and North Carolina even if 2026 is a 2018-type blue wave (D+7.3) election.

The starkness of this challenge is underscored by the difficulties of being truly moderate in today’s Democratic Party. As liberal Ezra Klein admitted, apropos of the 2025 results:

If Democrats want power in the Senate in any significant numbers ever again, they’re going to need to be competitive in places where they used to be able to win elections. Places like Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and Alaska. But they’ve not really been competitive there for some time.

So I don’t know how much I think this was a positive test of that…Abigail Spanberger is a moderate in Virginia and Zohran Mamdani is a democratic socialist in New York City…But also by any historical measure of politics, they’re actually just not that far apart. Abigail Spanberger is a moderate within the current Democratic Party, but she is not a moderate from the perspective of 1998.

The thing about all three of these figures is that none of them challenge Democrats in any significant way, except maybe Mamdani, from the left…I don’t think the question of what you would need to do to win an election in Ohio, Florida and Iowa is answered yet.

Indeed not. The fact of the matter is that Democrats can’t just sprinkle affordability pixie dust over their candidates—they actually need to move their left-trending party to the right in important ways. As noted in the big New York Times feature on “Moving to the Center Is the Way to Win”:

The success of candidates like [Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who successfully defended her House seat in a district that Trump won easily] demonstrates that America still has a political center. Polls show that most voters prefer capitalism to socialism and worry that the government is too big—and also think that corporations and the wealthy have too much power. Most voters oppose both the cruel immigration enforcement of the Trump administration and the lax Biden policies that led to a record immigration surge. Most favor robust policing to combat crime and recoil at police brutality. Most favor widespread abortion access and some restrictions late in pregnancy. Most oppose race-based affirmative action and support class-based affirmative action. Most support job protections for trans people and believe that trans girls should not play girls’ sports. Most want strong public schools and the flexibility to choose which school their children attend…

[Trump’s] extremism offers an opportunity to the Democratic Party. Mr. Trump is governing in ways that put the Republican Party out of step with public opinion on taxes, health insurance, abortion, immigration, executive power and more. If Democrats were willing to be less ideological—less beholden to views that many liberal activists, intellectuals and donors genuinely hold but that most Americans do not—they would have the opportunity to build the country’s next governing majority.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXFF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ae75d0-c329-46b6-824c-c820640fedd1_1100x220.jpeg",N,,2025-11-17 14:04:14.812366

Big bets on building, acquiring gas

NRG Energy expects to announce a data center agreement in 2026 associated with new natural gas development in its partnership with GE Vernova and Kiewit, the company’s CEO, Lawrence Coben, said in a Nov. 6 earnings call.

The first step of that joint venture is to start work on four gas projects totaling around 5.4 GW for the ERCOT and PJM markets. During the call, Coben said a data center agreement is set to be announced sometime next year, but he declined to pin down an exact month or quarter for the announcement.

“As far as [GE Vernova] goes, in this Kiewit partnership, did you have a certain time frame that you need to move some of this equipment — use it or lose it, if you will?” asked Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Coben said the company hasn’t disclosed a time frame yet, but added, “I’m very confident that we’re going to meet all of the timelines that are required under that agreement.”

NRG, GE Vernova and Kiewit plan to have 1.2 GW of combined-cycle gas turbines in service by 2029, another 1.2 GW in service by 2030, and an additional 3 GW brought online from 2030 to 2032. Development activities are in progress across all sites, the company said.

NRG is also anticipating the closure of its deal to acquire 19 GW of assets from LS Power in the first quarter next year for roughly $12 billion. The assets include a demand-response company and around 12.9 GW of gas-fired power plant capacity. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the plan on Friday.

On the call, NRG also provided updates on resources it is developing in Texas. In September, NRG “entered into a $562 million loan agreement with the Public Utility Commission of Texas ... for a low-interest rate loan at 3%” to support development of the 689-MW Cedar Bayou generation facility, the company said.

In response to an analyst question about NRG’s priorities within PJM, as opposed to ERCOT, Coben said the company “will really accelerate those efforts, of course, once [the LS acquisition] closes. Because once we own the generation assets there, that will really vault us into being a significant player. But there is no grass growing under our feet there in the meantime.”

Across PJM and ERCOT, NRG has expanded its data center customer portfolio with “150 MW of new premium long-term power agreements, bringing total contracted capacity to 445 MW,” Coben said.

Coben noted that total electricity consumption in Texas has increased “nearly 30% over the past five years, driven by residential, commercial and industrial demand, as electrification and onshoring of manufacturing accelerate. Data center development usage remains early, with ramp schedules expected to add meaningful capacity over the next several years.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/vS3lpRxxYrc3eJ8ZesMJg4ICC_DxYstg5ZJ_9wghHFI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9OUkdfSm9saWV0X1Bvd2VyX1N0YXRpb24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-17 15:02:34.328515

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Hamm Institute for American Energy's American Energy + AI Initiative, along with the National Center of Energy Analytics and the CGCN Group's American Energy + AI Coalition, today announced the outcomes of the American Energy + AI DC Summit.

The working session brought together U.S. cabinet officials, senior industry executives, investors and policy experts to examine how the United States can add enough firm power, on near-term timelines, to meet rapidly rising AI-driven demand. The event was held at GE Vernova's Washington, D.C. office.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior Kate MacGregor provided a briefing on current efforts and remaining gaps.

They participated in the discussion as part of the administration's focus on modernizing federal tools at the Department of Energy and Department of the Interior to support increased power production, transmission buildout, and smarter use of federal lands and emergency authorities.

Through its American Energy + AI Initiative, the Hamm Institute has spent the past year commissioning new research on how to power AI with firm energy, translating that work into policy-ready insights, and hosting working sessions from Oklahoma City to Palo Alto to bring industry, policymakers and investors into alignment around near-term solutions.

""America's ability to lead in AI will depend on whether we can build enough firm power, fast. The Hamm Institute's American Energy + AI Initiative exists to turn convenings like the Summit into steel in the ground, projects underway, and a clear research-backed roadmap that industry and policymakers can use,"" said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, PhD, executive director of the Hamm Institute for American Energy.

As the non-political partner, the Hamm Institute is leading the convening. In contrast, the American Energy + AI Coalition, led by CGCN, is focused on the policy, legislative and regulatory roadmap required to translate those findings.

""This was yet another productive session by the leaders of the Hamm Institute. Through extensive outreach and dialogue, they are developing concrete, meaningful policy reforms to help advance the power and AI goals shared by the electricity and technology sectors, as well as the Trump administration,"" said Mike Catanzaro, CEO of CGCN Group and executive director of the American Energy + AI Coalition. ""Many thanks to Secretary Wright and Deputy Secretary MacGregor for their participation today and their effective leadership on this critically important issue for the nation.""

The Hamm Institute for American Energy commissioned a new study from Mark P. Mills, executive director of the National Center for Energy Analytics and distinguished fellow at the Hamm Institute, titled The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts. The report analyzes how surging AI deployment is reshaping U.S. electricity demand and the broader economy and outlines the scale of new firm power required for America to stay competitive. Mills, who testified on AI and data centers before the House Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs in April 2025, shared key implications for policymakers during the Summit.

""Forecasters, pundits, and policymakers have all been surprised, even shocked, by the magnitude and speed of electricity demand emerging to power AI and the hundreds of billions of dollars of data centers under construction and planned,"" said Mills. ""The economic and strategic importance of the AI race sidelines the idea of an energy transition and highlights the old 'all-of-the-above' approach, especially the immediate needs for more natural gas.""

The Rise of AI is the first paper in a series of reports and forecasts to be produced between the two organizations.

GE Vernova hosted the Summit as part of its work to support customers across power generation, grid, and nuclear as they respond to surging demand from AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

""AI has tremendous opportunity to drive economic growth, and it all starts with energy,"" said GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. ""Behind every data center is critical demand for reliable and affordable power. The countries that build resilient, modern energy systems will define the next wave of global competitiveness. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers and appreciate the Hamm Institute leading this work with research and convenings along with the partnership of Secretaries Burgum and Wright as the Administration works to develop smart energy and innovation policies to shape the future.""

Most of the charging stations are located at gas stations like Kwik Trip.

Wisconsin will soon install 26 new electric vehicle charging stations using an influx of $14 million in federal money that the Trump administration attempted to block.

In May, Wisconsin joined 15 states in suing the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy — a former Wisconsin congressman — over the administration's freeze of electric vehicle infrastructure funds.

In June, a federal judge ordered the administration to release funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which included more than $62 million for Wisconsin.

“Thanks to our actions to get the Trump administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve,"" Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said in a Nov. 17 news release.

The new charging stations span the state, from Port Washington to Arbor Vitae to Eau Claire. Many are located at Kwik Trips, other gas stations and hotels.

In total, 78 charging stations have been installed using $36 million from the program. The vast majority are located at gas stations.

Members of both parties pushed through legislation last year that paved the way for Wisconsin to participate in the federal program, created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law during the Biden administration.

Federal funds can cover up to 80% of the costs of building out each charging station. Companies applying for the grants, such as Kwik Trip, Tesla and Universal EV, cover a minimum of 20%.

And despite President Donald Trump’s insistence that crime is out of control in big cities, residents of the nation’s largest metropolitan centers are less likely to list crime and gun violence among the chief concerns facing their communities than they were a couple years ago.

Optimism about the future is also down from last year in areas with large Hispanic communities.

These are some of the snapshots from the new ACP/Ipsos survey, which offers a nuanced look at local concerns by breaking the nation’s counties into community types, using data points like race, income, age and religious affiliation. The survey evaluated moods and priorities across the 15 different community types, such as heavily Hispanic areas, big cities and different kinds of rural communities.

The common denominator across the communities? A gnawing worry about daily household costs.

“Concerns about inflation are across the board,” said Dante Chinni, founder and director of ACP. “One thing that truly unites the country is economic angst.”

Rising optimism in rural areas, despite economic anxiety

Rural residents are feeling more upbeat about the country's trajectory — even though most aren't seeing Trump's promised economic revival.

The $15 price tag on a variety pack of Halloween candy at the Kroger supermarket last month struck Carl Gruber. Disabled and receiving federal food aid, the 42-year-old from Newark, Ohio, had hardly been oblivious to lingering, high supermarket prices.

But Gruber, whose wife also is unable to work, is hopeful about the nation's future, primarily in the belief that prices will moderate as Trump suggests.

“Right now, the president is trying to get companies who moved their businesses out of the country to move them back,” said Gruber, a Trump voter whose support has wavered over the federal shutdown that delayed his monthly food benefit. “So, maybe we'll start to see prices come down.”

About 6 in 10 residents of Rural Middle America — Newark's classification in the survey — say they are hopeful about the country's future over the next few years, up from 43% in the 2024 ACP survey. Other communities, like heavily evangelical areas or working-class rural regions, have also seen an uptick in optimism.

Kimmie Pace, a 33-year-old unemployed mother of four from a small town in northwest Georgia, said, “I have anxiety every time I go to the grocery store.”

But she, too, is hopeful in Trump. “Trump’s in charge, and I trust him, even if we’re not seeing the benefits yet,” she said.

Big-city residents are worried about the future

By contrast, the share of big-city residents who say they are hopeful about the nation's future has shrunk, from 55% last year to 45% in the new survey.

Robert Engel of San Antonio — Texas' booming, second most-populous city — is worried about what's next for the U.S., though less for his generation than the next. The 61-year-old federal worker, whose employment was not interrupted by the government shutdown nor Trump's effort to reduce the federal workforce, is near retirement and feels financially stable.

A stable job market, health care availability and a fair economic environment for his adult children are his main priorities.

Recently, the inflation outlook has worsened under Trump. Consumer prices in September increased at an annual rate of 3%, up from 2.3% in April, when the president first began to roll out substantial tariff increases that burdened the economy with uncertainty.

Engel's less-hopeful outlook for the country is broader. “It's not just the economy, but the state of democracy and polarization,” Engel said. “It's a real worry. I try to be cautiously optimistic, but it's very, very hard.”

Crime, gun violence are less a concern in urban America

Trump had threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he said was runaway, urban crime.

Yet data shows most violent crime in those places, and around the country, has declined in recent years. That tracks with the poll, which found that residents of America's Big Cities and Middle Suburbs are less likely to list crime or gun violence among the top issues facing their communities than they were in 2023.

For Angel Gamboa, a retired municipal worker in Austin, Texas, Trump's claims don't ring true in the city of roughly 1 million people.

“I don't want to say it's overblown, because crime is a serious subject,"" Gamboa said. “But I feel like there's an agenda to scare Americans, and it's so unnecessary.”

Instead, residents of Big Cities are more likely to say immigration and health care are important issues for their communities.

Big Cities are one of the community types where residents are most likely to say they’ve seen changes in immigration recently, with 65% saying they’ve seen a change in their community related to immigration over the past 12 months, compared with only about 4 in 10 residents of communities labeled in the survey as Evangelical Hubs or Rural Middle America.

Gamboa says he has witnessed changes, notably outside an Austin Home Depot, where day laborers regularly would gather in the mornings to find work.

Not anymore, he said.

“Immigrants were not showing up there to commit crimes,"" Gamboa said. ""They were showing up to help their families. But when ICE was in the parking lot, that's all it took to scatter people who were just trying to find a job.”

Hispanic communities are less hopeful about the future

After Hispanic voters moved sharply toward Trump in the 2024 election, the poll shows that residents of heavily Hispanic areas are feeling worse about the future of their communities than they were before Trump was elected.

Carmen Maldonado describes her community of Kissimmee, Florida, a fast-growing, majority-Hispanic city of about 80,000 residents about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Orlando, as “seriously troubled.”

The 61-year-old retired, active-duty National Guard member isn't alone. The survey found that 58% of residents of such communities are hopeful about the future of their community, down from 78% last year.

“It's not just hopelessness, but fear,” said Maldonado, who says people in her community — even her fellow native Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens — are anxious about the Trump administration's aggressive pursuit of Latino immigrants.

Just over a year ago, Trump made substantial inroads with Hispanic voters in the 2024 presidential election.

Beyond just the future of their communities, Hispanic respondents are also substantially less likely to say they’re hopeful about the future of their children or the next generation: 55% this year, down from 69% in July 2024.

Maldonado worries that the Trump administration's policies have stoked anti-Hispanic attitudes and that they will last for her adult child's lifetime and beyond.

“My hopelessness comes from the fact that we are a large part of what makes up the United States,” she said, “and sometimes I cry thinking about these families.”

Parwani and Thomson-DeVeaux reported from Washington.

While the U.S. civilian nuclear industry today employs about 70,000 people, that workforce will need to at least triple within the next decade to meet the goal of ten new reactors by 2030.

In 2023, however, the International Atomic Energy Agency announced a coordinated research project to explore ways artificial intelligence (AI) might expedite the deployment of small modular reactors. The IAEA said that sophisticated AI computer systems, which mimic human logic in problem solving and decision making, can enhance efficiency, automation, safety, and predictive maintenance – all while optimizing processes.

Kevin Kong, founder and CEO of Everstar, says the reason that the U.S. nuclear workforce is aging is that its nuclear powerplants themselves are aging – for two reasons. Nuclear energy, Kong says, has perhaps the worst public relations in the history of commerce. It gets condemned for one or two bad days, while catastrophes with lesser fuels hardly slowed their development.

That’s bad enough, he says, but an even bigger obstacle to a vigorous nuclear energy industry has for the past five decades been the regulatory Gordian Knot that has driven permitting and construction times – and costs – through the roof.

It only took 22 months in the 1950s for American technology to permit and construct the nation’s first commercial nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. The recently commissioned Vogtle units 3 and 4 in Georgia took an average of 15 years apiece through the regulatory labyrinth.

Vogtle’s delays, however, pale in comparison with the nightmares experienced by the operators of the Watts Bar 1 and 2 reactors in Tennessee. Construction on unit 1 began in 1973, but the reactor did not begin commercial operation until 1996. Construction of Unit 2, which finally went online in 2016, began all the way back in 1972. That’s 44 years – no wonder there were massive cost overruns.

Tech giants like Google are counting on Everstar’s “knot-cutting” solutions to move nuclear power from being stuck in quicksand to the forefront. They need clean and guaranteed 24/7/365 energy, and nuclear is “clean, firm, carbon-free, and can be sited just about anywhere,” says Google’s Michael Terrell.

America today has an estimated 3,000 data centers, with thousands more being built or planned for operations by 2030, plus thousands more worldwide. This growth rate could increase global data center power demand by as much as 165% within the next five years. A Goldman Sachs estimate suggests energy demand for data centers could reach 400 terawatt-hours by 2030 – four times that in 2020.

Nuclear is perhaps the only technology that can meet that exponential demand growth – but only if permitting and construction periods can be slashed, a skilled workforce can be recruited and trained, and sufficient nuclear fuel can be acquired and processed. A recent MIT study found that the U.S. needs to get 45 to 50 new reactors up and running quickly just to meet growing electricity demand from data centers..

Kong says his obsession with energy abundance stems from his recognition that every leap in human development followed an increase in energy density. Humanity went from wood to coal and it tripled, sparking the Industrial Revolution; oil’s energy density, twice that of coal, powers an electrified society that has brought prosperity to billions.

Nuclear energy, Kong says, has an energy density 1.5 million times that of natural gas.

Other nations recognize this – but the U.S. remains bogged down in bureaucracy and a lack of a sense of urgency brought about by decades of being told nuclear means death. This even though wood, coal, and oil have killed many more humans than nuclear power plants and that all three pollute the atmosphere to one degree or another. Cheaper nuclear can extend prosperity – if it ever gets the chance.

China is on a push to build 100 nuclear power plants in the next two decades, using U.S.-based reactor designs – at 20% of the cost for the same unit in the United States. Six to eight new plants are coming online each year. The shortage of qualified nuclear personnel in the U.S. is reflected in the fact that South Korean firms are providing the technical expertise for U.S. plants.

Kong, however, is not just pointing fingers. Everstar is already a world leader in designing AI for the nuclear energy industry. Everstar’s Gordian, its flagship AI platform, is revolutionizing nuclear licensing and regulatory compliance by cutting through the regulatory “Gordian Knot” that has grown exponentially since the Three Mile Island mini-meltdown.

Last November, Everstar and NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. announced the success of a three-month pilot project using Everstar’s AI solutions across a broad range of NANO’s regulatory and licensing workflows. The collaboration produced an advanced AI-driven compliance solution that simplified and streamlined NANO’s regulatory processes.

Everstar capitalized on that success after receiving $4 million in pre-seed funding in February to build out its Gordian Research, which launched on September 1. Built by a world-class team of nuclear and AI experts from Google, Microsoft, SpaceX, Tesla, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the CIA, Gordian organizes complex nuclear information and slashes document-heavy workflows by 80% or more.

The typical nuclear powerplant amasses 2 million labor hours and 2 million pages of paperwork just to get its reactor design approved – and a total of 500 million labor hours over the life of the reactor. That, says Kong, means that up to 90% of the cost of a new nuclear reactor is the result of paperwork. For example, the regulatory specs for a simple valve make the nuclear buyer pay 90 times the cost of the same valve to an oil and gas company.

While China is building 150 new nuclear plants, and other nations are start-to-finish in just a few years, the United States half a century ago – and even today – replaced a building culture at the old Atomic Energy Commission with a permission (denied) culture at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Without the regulatory Gordian Knot, nuclear might already be the cheapest of all.

Because Everstar’s Gordian platform has demonstrated its ability to dramatically accelerate the regulatory process without compromising safety standards, it is already in use in the operating reactor, new reactor, and radioactive materials industries and allowing engineers to do engineering work rather than endless paperwork.

Everstar’s Gordian platform is fundamentally changing how nuclear teams operate, says Kong. “This is why I built Everstar – to help unleash nuclear power as an abundant energy source.”

America, believes, cannot afford to miss the next quantum leap toward energy abundance, and nuclear, he insists, is the Standard Oil of the 21st century. Imagine where we would be today had we invested the $1.5 trillion we spent on far less efficient wind, solar, and other “green” energy on the one “green” energy that has the potential to turn the lights on worldwide.

With this growth comes significant capital investment and energy consumption.

Fortunately, U.S. tax policy offers key incentives data center operators can leverage to reduce costs and enhance cash flow while improving their energy consumption strategy.

Renewable energy credits for data centers

The investment tax credit

An increasing number of data centers are looking to renewable energy technologies such as solar and battery storage to supplement traditional grid-based sources. These systems not only support the growing energy demands of data centers — they also provide substantial tax savings through federal credits.

For decades, the investment tax credit (ITC) has served as a powerful tax incentive for organizations installing various types of renewable energy systems. The list of eligible technologies and the amount of the ITC were greatly expanded with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with many systems qualifying for a minimum credit of 30% of their cost. Investments eligible for the ITC include solar, battery storage, fuel cells, and geothermal HVAC — all of which can reduce grid reliance, costs, and carbon output — providing an all-around win for data center operators.

What’s more, data centers that can’t use their federal energy credits due to net operating losses can sell them for cash under the IRA’s transferability option, which has created a robust market for credit buyers and sellers.

Solar

Whether ground- or roof-mounted, solar installations have become common investments for businesses thanks to technology gains and improved project economics through tax incentives.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), however, enacted rollbacks impacting the solar ITC, including an accelerated termination date of December 31, 2027 for certain projects and more stringent beginning-of-construction rules. Despite the changes, solar projects remain attractive investments, but could be up against a running clock. As such, now is the time for data centers to explore how solar can enhance operations and cash flow.

Energy storage

The IRA placed a major emphasis on energy storage investments like battery and thermal systems. Batteries can be incorporated into data centers on a standalone basis to store grid-based electricity or by being integrated with photovoltaic arrays to store solar-generated power. In both cases, they can play a major role in energy peak shaving and back-up generation while supporting sustainability goals.

Fuel cells

Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction, often by combining hydrogen and oxygen. As a secondary energy source at data centers, they can be used for backup power or during high peak times. Fuel cells can further integrate with combined heat and power systems and storage technology to create a microgrid environment, allowing data centers to operate independently from the main grid during outages or peak demand. With a boost under the IRA, fuel cells can generate significant ITCs, often at a rate of 30% or higher.

Geothermal cooling

Geothermal cooling is a highly energy-efficient option for absorbing the large amount of heat data centers generate. It leverages the stable temperatures found underground to help regulate the temperature of the facility and serve chilled water needs for industrial processes. Geothermal heat pump systems provide a reliable, year-round heat sink (or source), reducing reliance on traditional HVAC systems.

The ITC for geothermal can be quite generous thanks in part to the extensive list of system components that can be used toward the credit. With a comprehensive geothermal ITC analysis, nearly the entirety of a facility’s heating and cooling systems can be claimed in some circumstances.

How do cost segregation and bonus depreciation apply for data centers?

A cost segregation study is a tax strategy used by property owners to increase cash flow by accelerating depreciation deductions. This is done by segregating building assets — which are generally depreciated over 39 years — into shorter-lived assets that may qualify for faster depreciation periods of 5, 7, or 15 years.

These shorter-lived assets are also generally eligible for bonus depreciation, which was restored to 100% and made permanent under the OBBBA for property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025.

Below are common data center assets that can often qualify for shorter tax lives and full expensing with bonus depreciation:

Servers and racking

Networking equipment (e.g., routers, switches)

Electrical dedicated to processing/computing assets

Dedicated cooling equipment and piping

Certain renewable energy assets and improvements

How can the section 179D deduction impact data centers?

Often overlooked by data centers, Section 179D is a deduction available for energy efficient commercial buildings that can exceed $5 per square foot. The deduction specifically applies to certain energy-related components like interior lighting, HVAC, and a building’s envelope (e.g., insulation, windows, roofing). For a building to qualify, it must meet certain energy efficiency requirements and be certified by a properly credentialed energy professional.

For building owners that missed claiming the Section 179D deduction when their qualifying building was placed in service, the deduction can be claimed in a subsequent year without having to amend tax returns. This is done by filing an accounting method change on IRS Form 3115 to “catch up” the missed deductions. (The Form 3115 process is also available for depreciation changes resulting from a cost segregation study).

Section 179D, when combined with a cost segregation and bonus depreciation, can result in immediate expensing of the majority of a data center’s structural and non-structural assets. Companies, however, need to evaluate Section 179D now because the OBBBA accelerated its termination date to June 30, 2026 for property that has not begun construction on or before such date.

In today’s edition of Projects Weekly, we’re looking at selection of large-scale solar projects, as well as acquisitions impacting market. First off is Titan Energy and Greenskies Clean Focus partnership to bring rooftop solar to the Soundview Family YMCA in Connecticut. Zelestra has closed on a U.S. tax equity transaction for the 81 MW Jasper County Solar project in Indiana. Fullmark Energy has completed the 65 MW San Jacinto Energy Storage project in California. Dispatch Energy has acquires Green Lantern Solar and its distributed generation (DG) footprint across nine states. And finally, RWE completed its first project in Louisiana. Let’s get to it!

Titan Energy, Greenskies partner on innovative solar roof lease project

Titan Energy and Greenskies Clean Focus have completed a unique renewable energy project with the Soundview Family YMCA in Branford, Connecticut, delivering financial and sustainability benefits to the community-focused organization.

“This project demonstrates how nonprofit organizations like the Soundview Family YMCA can achieve meaningful financial savings while advancing sustainability goals,” said Kyle Ramm, managing director at Titan Energy. “By leveraging creative energy strategies, we were able to deliver long-term benefits without upfront cost. We’re proud to partner with Greenskies to complete such an impactful project.”

Cool factor: Unlike a traditional power purchase agreement (PPA), this project was structured as a roof lease. By hosting solar panels on its rooftop, the Soundview Family YMCA will receive approximately $20,000 annually from Greenskies — providing a consistent, long-term revenue stream without requiring any upfront investment or changes to existing energy systems.

The Soundview Family YMCA’s facility already operates a combined heat and power (CHP) system that covers much of its electricity and heating needs. To ensure compatibility and avoid interfering with the CHP system, Titan Energy and Greenskies structured the solar project to deliver power directly to Eversource’s grid under the state’s Non-residential Renewable Energy System (NRES) program. This arrangement allows the Soundview Family YMCA to benefit from annual lease payments while Greenskies generates clean energy for the regional grid.

In addition, the project implemented a series of additional energy-saving measures, reducing its Eversource utility costs at no out-of-pocket expense to the organization. Together, these efforts align with the Soundview Family YMCA’s core motivation: lowering operational costs while advancing its commitment to sustainability.

“This project is a great example of how creative solar structures can deliver tangible value to mission-driven organizations,” said Ryan Linares, VP of Real Estate of Greenskies Clean Focus. “By partnering with Titan Energy and the Soundview Family YMCA, we were able to turn unused roof space into a reliable source of revenue, helping the YMCA strengthen its financial foundation while contributing to a cleaner energy future for the broader community.”

Zelestra closes on tax equity transaction for 81 MW Jasper County Solar Project

Zelestra has secured tax equity funding of approximately $60 million from Stonehenge Capital for the 81 MWdc (60 MWac) Jasper County Solar Project. Located in Jasper County, Indiana, the project has a long-term environmental attributes purchase agreement (EAPA) with Meta, one of six in total that the two companies have in partnership across the United States. The project will be fully operational in Q4 2025.

“This marks another significant milestone in our commitment to deliver projects that meet our clients’ needs,” said Sybil Milo Cioffi, Zelestra’s U.S. CFO. “We look forward to celebrating the completion of Jasper later this year, and to advancing our 1 GW of fully contracted projects now moving toward construction and expected to be operational in the next two years.”

Cool factor: This significant milestone follows the announcement in April 2025 that the company closed a $113 million project financing for the project with Banco Santander. Zelestra is advancing its position in the U.S. energy landscape with innovative, multi-technology solutions tailored to the evolving needs of hyperscalers and corporate partners. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, the company is developing a robust portfolio of more than 10 GW of renewable energy projects across key markets.

“The collaboration with Zelestra exemplifies Stonehenge Capital’s focus on supporting energy infrastructure throughout the nation,” said Whitney LaNasa, senior managing director at Stonehenge Capital. “We look forward to working alongside Zelestra, a distinguished name in global energy, to bring this project to operations.”

With a portfolio of approximately 32 GW of carbon-free projects in six key growth markets (U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Latam and India), 6.8 GW is contracted with customers and in operations, construction, or pre-construction stage.

Fullmark Energy completes 65 MW San Jacinto Energy Storage Project

Fullmark Energy has announced the commercial operations date (COD) of its 65 MW / 130 MWh San Jacinto storage project in Banning, California. The milestone marks the final project within Fullmark Energy’s Redwood Projects portfolio — a strategic collection of energy storage facilities across Southern California — to achieve commercial operations.

“Reaching commercial operations across the Redwood Projects marks a major milestone for our team and our partners,” said Chris McKissack, Chief Executive Officer of Fullmark Energy. “These projects strengthen grid reliability, accelerate the renewable energy transition, and demonstrate our team’s ability to deliver high-performing assets at scale. San Jacinto is particularly meaningful because it shows how energy storage can simultaneously enhance grid infrastructure while revitalizing communities and creating value for local stakeholders.”

Cool factor: San Jacinto is Fullmark’s third project to reach COD in 2025, joining three other operational facilities in Fullmark Energy’s Redwood Projects portfolio. The 20 MW / 80 MWh Johanna ESS project in Santa Ana reached COD in October 2021, while the 20 MW / 40 MWh Desert-Carris project in Palm Springs and the 20 MW / 40 MWh Ortega Project in Lake Elsinore both reached COD earlier this year. These three 2025 projects deliver 105 MW of new capacity to the Southern California Edison distribution system.

The San Jacinto project exemplifies how energy storage development can drive positive community transformation. The 65 MW facility sits on previously abandoned property that had become an overgrown, nuisance property, creating challenges for surrounding residents and businesses. Working closely with local stakeholders, Fullmark transformed the site into well-maintained infrastructure with proper security fencing and lighting, significantly improving conditions for the neighborhood. The project also generates economic benefits for the city of Banning’s municipal electric utility, which serves approximately 13,500 customers and serves the project’s load.

The Redwood Projects represent 125 MW / 290 MWh of operational capacity across four strategically located facilities in Southern California, making it one of the largest independently owned battery storage portfolios in the region. The projects were developed with diversified offtake agreements to strengthen revenue profiles and reduce risk. In January 2023, Fullmark secured $100 million in financing for the portfolio through a consolidated term loan and letter of credit facility. All four facilities participate in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market, providing critical grid services including energy arbitrage, frequency regulation, and resource adequacy.

Dispatch Energy acquires Green Lantern Solar

Dispatch Energy LLC has acquired Green Lantern Solar (GLS), along with more than 64 solar and battery storage projects totaling 208.9 MWdc, at various stages of development and operations. This transaction brings Dispatch’s total portfolio to 489.5 MW, as the company works to aggregate distributed generation resources nationally.

“This acquisition provides an excellent result for GLS shareholders and employees,” said Luke Shullenberger, founder and CEO of Green Lantern Solar. “We appreciate the execution-oriented approach of Dispatch Energy’s team and believe that the business will continue to grow under their leadership into the future.”

This acquisition expands Dispatch’s footprint in the growing distributed generation market across Georgia, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

Cool factor: Dispatch will acquire 100% of Green Lantern’s operations, including operating and early-stage development assets as well as Operations and Maintenance (“O&M”) services business.

“Dispatch remains committed to the energy transition and we are excited to welcome Green Lantern’s team, operations, and assets into our portfolio,” said Richard Dovere, CEO of Dispatch Energy. “We are proud to have the opportunity to acquire this excellent founder-led business.”

Founded in 2024, Dispatch Energy raised over $360 MM in 2025 to pursue opportunities in distributed generation.

RWE’s first project in Louisiana completes construction

RWE has completed construction of its first project in Louisiana, the 100 MW Lafitte Solar project located in the Ouachita Parish, outside of Monroe. The project will be fully online and generating energy by the end of the year. Lafitte Solar was enabled through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Meta, through which Meta also receives all environmental benefits associated with the project, including RECs.

“Lafitte Solar is RWE’s first project in Louisiana, and will provide low-cost, homegrown energy to the Louisiana grid and generate enough electricity to power 17,000 local homes and businesses,” said Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy. “By providing affordable and reliable electricity, we are strengthening Monroe’s power supply while supporting the community’s growth and resilience.”

The project was celebrated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, local officials from the Ouachita Parish Police Jury and Ouachita Parish Industrial Development Board, RWE leadership and employees and construction partner McCarthy Building Companies (McCarthy).

Cool factor: Over its operating lifetime, Lafitte Solar is projected to generate approximately $32 million in regional tax revenue — supporting public schools, law enforcement and emergency services. Construction of Lafitte Solar was completed in collaboration with RWE’s EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) partner McCarthy, supporting more than 150 full-time jobs on the project at its peak. During construction, workers supported local businesses and restaurants, and shopped at area stores, amplifying the project’s economic impact.

RWE remains dedicated to supporting local schools and families. The company partnered with Roy Neal Shelling, Sr. Elementary School, providing donations to support classroom resources, while its construction partner McCarthy supplied toys during the holiday. RWE and McCarthy remain committed to improving the quality of life for children in the local area by funding a new playground being built at Tanglewood Community Park. Additionally, RWE and McCarthy together provided one of the largest holiday food donations the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana has received, supporting families throughout Monroe during the Christmas season.

Lafitte Solar’s site design features natural and native vegetation around the perimeter, promoting biodiversity and habitat conservation to benefit the project’s land and surrounding farmlands. The project will also incorporate agrivoltaics, using a flock of over 600 sheep to maintain healthy vegetation onsite. This practice not only protects local farmland but deepens partnerships with regional farmers, demonstrating how renewable energy coexists with agriculture.

By Joshua T. Bledsoe, Nikki Buffa, Jennifer K. Roy, Nolan Fargo, and Samantha Yeager

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved Texas’s application to assume primary enforcement responsibility, or “primacy,” for Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells within the state. Class VI UIC wells are used for the permanent geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep underground rock formations. Under the final rule, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) will become the permitting authority for Class VI wells statewide. For more details on the proposed rule to grant Texas primacy, see this Latham blog post.

EPA’s approval follows a comprehensive technical and legal review of Texas’s program revision application, which concluded that the state’s statutes, regulations, and administrative framework for permitting and regulating Class VI UIC wells meet the federal requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Texas already administers UIC programs for other well classes. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality oversees Class I (deep waste disposal), III (mineral extraction), IV (hazardous waste in groundwater cleanup), and V (non-hazardous fluid disposal) wells. The RRC oversees certain Class V wells (shallow geothermal injection wells) and Class II (oil and gas waste disposal and enhanced oil recovery wells).

Class VI primacy could accelerate permitting for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by leveraging local technical expertise and Texas’s established regulatory infrastructure.

Federal and State Support for Texas Primacy

The final rule garnered support from federal and state officials, who emphasized the potential benefits of granting Texas primacy. RRC Chairman Jim Wright called it “an important step forward for [the] state’s energy sector” that could serve “to reduce regulatory overlap.” According to Senator John Cornyn, primacy allows Texas “to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency.”

The RRC reports that it has already received 18 Class VI UIC well applications and is aware of additional projects being planned across the state.

Broader Trend

Texas joins a growing list of states with Class VI primacy, including Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Most recently, EPA granted Arizona primacy for all UIC well classes. These approvals underscore a broader national trend toward state-level administration of CCS permitting.

What’s Next

EPA’s final rule will take effect December 15, 2025. Project proponents should track the RRC’s Class VI program implementation — including application forms, guidance, and timelines — and prepare to participate in state permitting processes.

EPA told CCJ on Monday the agency continues to reevaluate the rule and plans to propose a rule in the spring of 2026 that will take effect the following model year.
The new limits currently tighten tailpipe NOx emissions to a level 80%-plus below the current standard and reduce the particulate matter limit by 50%.

The American Trucking Associations, National Tank Truck Carriers, Truckload Carriers Association, and 49 state trucking associations in August penned a letter to EPA, asking the regulator to push implementation to 2031, citing ""substantial compliance costs and operational burdens at a time when the trucking industry is already contending with historically difficult market conditions.""

Administrator Lee Zeldin in March announced EPA was reevaluating the Biden-era 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle rule that regulates oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other emissions beginning with Model Year 2027.

EPA told CCJ on Monday the agency continues to reevaluate the rule and plans to propose a rule in the spring of 2026 that will take effect the following model year.

""If finalized,"" EPA said, ""the action will make major changes to the program requirements while maintaining the Model Year 2027 start of the standards, which can significantly reduce the cost of new heavy-duty vehicles, while still protecting human health and the environment, and avoiding regulatory distortions of the heavy-duty vehicle market.""

A spokesperson for Daimler Truck North America told CCJ Monday that the company appreciates EPA's efforts to reduce costs while maintaining a focus on air quality and legislative consistency, adding ""[This] announcement provides the regulatory certainty needed for effective production planning and customer support.""

The decision to remain on course is somewhat of a reversal in recent emissions policy that has seen EPA dismantle California’s vehicle emissions standards, target for repeal the Endangerment Finding — which would roll back the Greenhouse Gas Phase 3 rule — and help unravel the Clean Truck Partnership between California and truck and engine manufacturers.

The new limits currently tighten tailpipe NOx emissions to a level 80%-plus below the current standard and reduce the particulate matter limit by 50%. The agency also will require that OEMs extend warranties to 450,000 miles from 100,000 and useful life limits to 650,000 miles from 435,000 miles.

The standards require heavy-duty commercial vehicles to limit nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to 0.035 grams per horsepower-hour during normal operation, 0.050 grams at low load, and 10.0 grams at idle, and will also increase the useful life of governed vehicles by 1.5 to 2.5 times and yield emissions warranties that are 2.8 to 4.5 times longer — provisions that guarantee that as vehicles age, they will continue to meet EPA’s more stringent emissions standards for a longer period of time.

The 1,153-page rule also requires manufacturers to better ensure that vehicle engines and emission control systems work properly on the road, including demonstrating that engines are designed to prevent drivers and fleets from tampering with emission controls by limiting tamper-prone access to electronic pollution controls.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/11/adobestock-301942467.HGNzQos8R9.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-17 14:03:25.438537

The price drop is set to squeeze Russian oil companies’ finances and shrink tax revenues for the Kremlin—funds that help sustain the war in Ukraine.
For a country where oil and gas make up about a quarter of the state budget, it’s truly remarkable that—with all the geopolitical turmoil—oil prices are not climbing higher.
Given the expected cold weather, crude oil prices are unlikely to decrease much further, and there remains considerable risk of a price spike in the coming month.
Across the United States, the scale of data center development is remarkable.","It’s astonishing that oil prices aren’t soaring higher, given the dramatic headlines. Ukraine has managed to strike deep into Russia with long-range drones, hitting one of the country’s top ten refineries at Novokuybyshevsk and a military base—an operation confirmed by Ukraine’s General Staff and reported by the Kyiv Independent.

Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Oman, the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Talara was intercepted and diverted by Iranian Revolutionary Guards on November 14, suspected of carrying unauthorized goods. US Central Command and UKMTO have issued warnings about persistent threats in the region, urging extreme caution for maritime transit.

Yet, despite these significant disruptions, Russia’s flagship oil price just plunged to its lowest in over two and a half years, mere days before new U.S. sanctions are set to target the nation’s two biggest producers. The price drop is set to squeeze Russian oil companies’ finances and shrink tax revenues for the Kremlin—funds that help sustain the war in Ukraine. Discounts on Urals crude widened to an average of $23.52 per barrel below last week, the biggest gap since June 2023, according to Argus data. On Thursday, Urals crude from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk plummeted to $36.61 a barrel, its lowest since March 2023, with a similar story in the Baltic Sea market. Prices did inch up on Friday, but the trend remains surprising.

For a country where oil and gas make up about a quarter of the state budget, it’s truly remarkable that—with all the geopolitical turmoil—oil prices are not climbing higher. Oil continues to kind of struggle and because some Russian refineries are down, it’s assumed they’ll be dumping cheap barrels of crude even though no one wants to buy them right now. Given the expected cold weather, crude oil prices are unlikely to decrease much further, and there remains considerable risk of a price spike in the coming month.

The other big picture is the demand for artificial intelligence and data centers. Market watcher Tom Conrick wrote that Web Services (AWS) is making a historic investment in Indiana, with a massive $13 billion data center campus under construction between South Bend and New Carlisle. This project, which marks the largest single corporate investment in the state’s history, spans over 600 acres acquired through the shell company Razor5. Located along Indiana State Road 2 and Larrison Boulevard, the campus features at least seven buildings, each measuring 216,000 square feet, with their shells already completed.

The scale of the investment has grown from its initial $11 billion announcement, and AWS expects to create 1,000 jobs for both its own staff and contract workers. The company has secured sales tax exemptions for eligible capital investments over a 50-year period. Construction is moving at an “unprecedented” pace, with the first facilities scheduled to become operational in the first quarter of 2025. AWS has already started recruiting for technical and operations positions, underscoring the project’s momentum.

This new campus is strategically significant, as it will support AWS’s expanding need for cloud services and AI workloads. The development is also positioned near the $3.5 billion / electric vehicle battery plant, signaling the emergence of a high-tech corridor in northern Indiana. Similar activity is underway elsewhere in the country, including Chicago, where the former CBOE Global Markets headquarters is being converted into a 33-megawatt data center by Legacy Investing, a Virginia-based real estate firm. The building, which sold in October 2025 following upgrades to its power capacity, is expected to complete its transformation by late 2026. Another notable example in Chicago is the former R.R. Donnelley printing plant, now the Lakeside Technology Center at 350 East Cermak Road, recognized as one of the world’s largest data centers and a major internet interconnection hub.

Across the United States, the scale of data center development is remarkable. More than 3,000 facilities are currently tracked for development, expansion, or retrofitting. In August 2025 alone, 10.5 gigawatts of planned capacity were filed, representing billions of dollars of investment in states such as Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. The year-to-date construction value for 2025 stands at $12.9 billion, a 48% increase over the previous year, with $2.4 billion in new projects launched in June. The South and Midwest are especially active, with states like Ohio, Georgia, Arizona, and Texas leading the charge. Major projects include Amazon’s $2 billion facility in Sunbury, Ohio, Google’s $600 million data center in Mesa, Arizona, and the $100 billion Stargate joint venture by OpenAI, , and .

Infrastructure trends show rising power demand, prompting increased investment in energy infrastructure, while the acceleration of AI and cloud computing is driving the construction of hyperscale and edge data centers. Many previously paused projects are now resuming construction, reflecting renewed confidence in the sector. As of mid-2025, about 404 data centers are actively under construction across the U.S. ’s CEO, Jensen Huang, has noted that these developments will require hundreds of thousands of electricians and plumbers, highlighting the significant workforce implications of the ongoing data center boom.

is going to be a big part of that and the weather is going to be a big part of natural gas pricing. Fox Weather reported that, “Record-breaking November heat wave grips the South after major deep freeze for millions.

Policymakers can build on this initiative by supporting the commercialization of technologies that could help address AI startups’ energy challenges.","What energy policy agenda will enable startups to compete in AI?

That question is becoming more urgent as AI’s exponential growth drives an unprecedented demand for electricity. The Department of Energy forecasts that data center electricity use will nearly triple to 12 percent of US supply by 2028, up from 4.4 percent in 2023. Yet this surge is colliding with an analog-era grid: as of late 2023, an astounding 2,600 gigawatts (GW) of new energy projects—over 95 percent of which are zero-carbon—were waiting in grid interconnection queues, a backlog more than double the entire installed capacity of the US power plant fleet.

This multi-year logjam creates more than just scarcity; it creates a two-tiered market that structurally disadvantages startups. Large, established hyperscalers can lock in long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), securing billions of dollars in predictable energy and effectively buying out entire regions’ future power capacity. Startups don’t have this luxury. Lacking the scale and balance sheets to make such long-term commitments, startups cannot negotiate these priority positions and are left to face volatile spot markets and higher rates. Moreover, startups don’t have the legal teams or lobbying muscle to develop a bespoke AI energy policy agenda or to advance that agenda on Capitol Hill. Because of their comparative disadvantages in business and policy negotiations, the next generation of AI innovators may be denied access to the energy they need to compete with larger platforms; energy scarcity could become a durable competitive moat.

In AI, energy policy is not a peripheral concern; the challenge of “speed-to-power”—how fast a new data center can access energy—is key to competing in the AI industry. To ensure a level playing field, we need an AI energy policy agenda that works for startups.

This agenda should focus on three core concepts:

Generating energy abundance

Ensuring fair energy access

Innovating in energy supply and demand

The Abundance Agenda: More Supply, Lower Costs

AI’s energy demands require more supply. Without enough energy, costs increase and both large and small developers will face obstacles to building new AI tools. As the administration’s AI Action Plan recognizes, the foundational pillar of a forward-thinking energy policy must therefore focus on dramatically increasing the total supply of energy and data center capacity to lower costs for everyone.

Momentum for a pro-abundance energy agenda is increasingly bipartisan, with leaders from the Trump administration to the Democratic mayor of Silicon Valley’s largest city, championing robust reforms to expand energy supply and accelerate infrastructure buildout. Journalists Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein have provided an intellectual framework for abundance policy, articulating how supply-side solutions can underpin America’s competitiveness and innovation. Organizations such as the Abundance Institute and the Niskanen Center are researching and advocating for policy to realize a future of plentiful, affordable energy, bridging ideological divides and shaping a common path forward. This emerging consensus reflects a rare moment in contemporary policy where growth, innovation, and economic opportunity are rallying points across parties and institutions.

Policymakers are starting to realize the importance of expanding energy access. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No. 2023, which aims to reform the grid interconnection process and clear backlogs by shifting to a “first-ready, first-served” cluster study model. More recently, the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan calls for fast-tracking energy infrastructure construction, and Congress has held hearings on the energy needs of the AI sector. States are also heavily engaged in energy policy—some, fearing strain on the energy grid, are reconsidering existing data-center incentives or considering proposals that would require more transparency about data center energy usage, while others are doubling down on encouraging more AI activity within their borders.

But policymakers should take additional steps to reduce burdens to energy production and access:

Accelerate energy permitting. Speed up federal and state permitting for new energy generation and transmission infrastructure to allow supply to more rapidly meet demand from the AI sector. This should be coupled with a concerted effort to streamline and standardize the state and local permitting processes for data center siting.

Design smart transparency rules. Step cautiously in enacting data center transparency mandates—proposals that would require operators to report on metrics like energy consumption and water usage. There were more than 20 such bills introduced in 2025 alone. Any new transparency rules should be carefully designed to avoid slowing the construction of new capacity or imposing burdensome compliance costs that will disproportionately affect startups, given their small teams and limited budgets.

Unlock existing grid capacity. Reform outdated utility regulations that discourage the use of innovative grid-enhancing technologies. Incentivizing the deployment of these modern optimization tools could unlock as much as 100 GW of capacity on existing power lines.

Invest in the workforce. We must invest in the skilled workforce needed to build this new infrastructure. Addressing critical labor shortages, particularly for electricians, is not only essential to removing a key bottleneck for deployment but also represents a major opportunity to create a new generation of high-paying jobs for skilled trade workers across the country.

While boosting supply is paramount, we must also continue to innovate in efficiency. It’s crucial to increase public R&D for more energy-efficient AI, spanning both hardware and algorithms. However, we must also be clear-eyed about the limits of this approach. Efficiency gains alone are insufficient to address the demand problem, as improvements in efficiency frequently trigger increased consumption, a phenomenon known as the Jevons Paradox.

The Pro-Competitive Agenda: Ensuring Fair Access

While an abundance of energy is critical for both startups and large hyperscalers, it’s insufficient on its own to foster a competitive AI ecosystem. Policies that create more supply must be accompanied by policies that distribute that supply fairly. Preferential energy access would create new barriers to AI development, favoring large players over startups. To avoid this outcome, energy policy must address the structural disadvantages startups face in the energy and compute markets.

The cornerstone of fair, balanced access is ensuring that startups do not pay for the energy needs of hyperscalers. Large-scale AI deployment could increase energy costs for everyone else: a single hyperscale data center can require grid upgrades costing billions of dollars. If policy permits these costs to be “socialized” across all ratepayers rather than being borne directly by the entity causing them, startups will be disadvantaged.

For instance, a large hyperscaler could negotiate a custom contract with a state utility to power a new data center, a project requiring costly, large-scale upgrades to transmission lines and substations. If state regulators, eager to attract the investment, allow the utility to recover those upgrade costs across its entire customer base—overall electricity rates for all other customers will rise. Simultaneously, this type of project could consume all planned grid capacity in the region for years to come, leaving startups unable to secure power for their own smaller facilities. If costs rise due to hyperscaler demand, but hyperscalers don’t pay for this increased price, then residential customers and smaller businesses—including startups—would effectively subsidize the energy infrastructure of their largest competitors.

To prevent this outcome, policymakers could implement a “causer pays” principle that requires large-load users to directly fund the grid upgrades they require, rather than socializing these costs. This ensures that the entities driving increased demand are the ones who bear the financial responsibility for the necessary infrastructure improvements.

Fairness should also extend to energy procurement. To correct the imbalance caused by large companies securing favorable long-term PPA terms, policymakers and energy regulators should establish aggregated purchasing programs that allow startups to pool their demand, giving them the collective bargaining power needed to secure the same competitive energy contracts.

Energy policy should also reduce barriers to entry in AI by ensuring startups have access to the foundational resources needed for innovation. The immense cost of high-performance computing can prevent promising ideas from ever being developed. As we have written previously, the federal government can address this challenge by establishing a National AI Competitiveness Institute (NAICI), which would provide startups, researchers, and nonprofits with access to the infrastructure they need, including compute power, data, and model evaluation resources. By providing direct access to these energy-intensive computing resources, the NAICI would help startups manage the high infrastructure costs that can cut off their ability to innovate, making it easier for Little Tech to compete with larger platforms in building and testing new AI models.

The Innovation Agenda: Unleashing New Approaches to Energy Supply and Demand

Startups cannot compete with hyperscalers on sheer capital expenditure; their strength lies in their innovation and agility. Policy must create opportunities for them to leverage these unique advantages. A forward-looking strategy should focus on enabling startups to capitalize on their operational flexibility and participate in the development of next-generation energy technologies.

A key area for innovation is demand-side flexibility: the ability of energy consumers to actively manage when and how much electricity they use in response to the needs of the grid. State utility commissions, for instance, could direct utilities in their jurisdictions to offer innovative tariffs, like real-time pricing, which would allow startups to significantly reduce costs by shifting their computational workloads to off-peak hours when power is cheaper.

Furthermore, state and federal policymakers can increase startup access to demand response programs, which pay companies to temporarily reduce their energy use during periods of high grid stress. Lowering participation barriers for these programs would enable agile startups to generate revenue simply by pausing non-critical workloads, turning their operational agility into a direct economic advantage.

At the same time, policy should promote the development of next-generation power sources that can provide the 24/7 clean energy that AI data centers require, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). To accelerate SMR deployment, policymakers must build on the important progress of the bipartisan 2024 ADVANCE Act, which began to address the high cost of licensing through reducing certain fees and authorizing prize competitions to cover regulatory costs for innovators. Policymakers should ensure this new framework succeeds by conducting oversight to confirm the law’s regulatory reforms are being implemented effectively.

Likewise, advanced geothermal energy is a promising source of the 24/7 clean power that AI data centers require, but its deployment is severely hampered by complex permitting processes that can take seven to ten years on federal land. To accelerate this technology, policy should focus on speeding up federal leasing and drilling permits to reduce these costly development delays.

The Department of Energy’s recent funding for emerging technologies like AI and nuclear energy is a welcome step. Policymakers can build on this initiative by supporting the commercialization of technologies that could help address AI startups’ energy challenges.

For any new technology that expands energy supply or mitigates energy demand, startups must have equal access to the opportunity. To prevent large platforms from securing exclusive access to these new energy resources, legislators and regulators could mandate that utility development partnerships include opportunities for startup participation, either as energy off-takers, who purchase shares of the generated power, or as co-locators, who physically site their facilities at the new power source.

Securing America’s Energy Advantage in AI

The race for AI leadership could be won or lost on the electrical grid. The policy landscape, designed for a pre-AI era and predisposed to favor large providers over startups, now risks creating insurmountable barriers for the next generation of innovators. The path forward is not to simply power the nascent AI sector, but to ensure that energy policy does not leave small AI developers behind.

By embracing a comprehensive strategy built on abundance, pro-competitive market access, and a commitment to innovation, we can move beyond the zero-sum mindset of scarcity and toward a future where startups have affordable access to the energy they need. Let’s ensure the best ideas—not just the biggest balance sheets—have the power they need to win.",https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/11/Energy-Policy-Agenda-for-Ensure-a-Thriving-AI-Market-X.png,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:51.261571

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana’s Recycling Market Development Board just awarded six Indiana organizations with $2 million in grant funding to expand recycling across the state, a decision expected to create 42 new jobs and prevent an additional 197,884 tons of materials from going into landfills annually.

The grant recipients aren’t just community recycling bins. They span themes of textile waste, food waste, and lumber production. Goodwill Industries of Michiana will receive over $300,000 to buy new equipment that will let them recycle more textiles and phase out 4 million plastic bags used by Goodwill shoppers. Greencycle in Marion County will dedicate over $450,000 to a wood waste grinder that will process more than 21,000 tons each year. And in LaPorte County, Nexus IN RNG received $500,000 to buy equipment that will divert 105,000 tons of organic waste—that’s food waste—from landfills each year, while also creating new jobs for this project.

The grant money comes from the Recycling Promotion and Assistance Fund, which is funded by a per-ton fee on solid waste disposed of at Indiana landfills. This means the fees we pay when trash goes to the landfill help fund programs that keep trash out of landfills in the first place. Indiana currently diverts about 19% of waste from landfills through recycling and composting, but the state’s goal is 50%. These grants are part of the effort to close that gap—turning waste into resources, creating jobs, and building what experts call a “circular economy” where materials get reused instead of buried.

COP30

This week, thousands of diplomats and climate experts began gathering in Brazil—right at the edge of the Amazon rainforest—for COP30, the latest round of United Nations climate talks.

This conference takes place November 10-21 and is being called the Amazon COP or even the Nature COP—a moment for the world to see what’s at stake through Brazil’s eyes.

For the first time, more than 1,000 Indigenous representatives will have access to the main negotiation venue. Brazil is proposing something called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which would financially reward countries for protecting forests rather than cutting them down. The Amazon covers 6.5 million square kilometers, holds 13% of known species on the planet, and stores between 150 and 200 billion tons of carbon—that’s equivalent to 15-20 years of global carbon emissions. But over 17% of the forest in Brazilian territory has already been cut down, and 31% is degraded. Scientists have warned that losing just 5% more could push the forest past a tipping point, irreversibly transforming it into a savanna and releasing 300 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, making it impossible to meet the Paris Agreement’s climate targets.

The conference will also focus on mobilizing $1.3 trillion a year in climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change. As one Brazilian climate leader put it, “Our window to prevent runaway climate change is closing fast. The next five years will determine the next hundred years. The world is looking to Brazil to show that a standing forest is worth more than one that’s cut down.”

The White House has confirmed that no high-level U.S. officials would be in attendance, likely due to Trump’s repeated insistence that human-caused climate change is a hoax.

Instead, California Governor Gavin Newsom and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham have been the United States’ unofficial ambassadors. Whether COP30 becomes a turning point on climate progress or another round of unfulfilled promises will depend on whether world leaders choose action over politics, and implementation over negotiation.

Aurora Borealis Shows Off

GRIFFY LAKE via FACEBOOK -

Longtime Bloomington residents were stunned by a rare sighting on Tuesday evening—a glimpse of the incredible Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, dancing across our Midwest skies. The fantastical display of colors and lights was visible in Indiana and reached as far south as Florida with displays of green, red, and purple waves of light.

The sun is at the peak of its 11-year cycle, called solar maximum. The aurora occurred when the sun sent several bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections that reached Earth Tuesday night and early Wednesday. Forecasters explain that this created a severe geomagnetic storm and when those charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, they create these colorful light shows. Usually, you’d have to travel hundreds of miles north to see the aurora, but during strong storms like this one, they can stretch much farther south.

If you missed the display this week, you don’t need to book your ticket to the Arctic Circle just yet—we’re likely to see more of the aurora borealis over the next several months as the sun continues through this active phase. Nature’s light show might just be coming to our skies again soon.

This expansion will add an estimated 600 new jobs to the region. It is projected to increase First Solar’s total U.S. annual production capacity to 17.7 gigawatts (GW), adding 3.7 GW of new capacity.

The investment is part of a broader strategy to solidify First Solar’s U.S. manufacturing base. The company currently operates facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township, Ohio. This South Carolina announcement follows a separate $1.1 billion investment in new capacity, which includes a new factory in Louisiana and expansion of its existing Ohio footprint, both expected to be operational in 2025.

First Solar utilizes a thin-film technology platform that differs from traditional silicon-based solar panels. The company states its modules have a carbon footprint that is up to 30% lower than that of typical crystalline silicon PV panels manufactured in China.

The company’s expansion is occurring in a market influenced by U.S. industrial policy. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes advanced manufacturing production credits designed to incentivize domestic production of solar components. And this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, barring solar projects from tax credits if they source products from Chinese businesses or businesses with substantial investment from Chinese entities.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

The move into South Carolina follows recent challenges for other manufacturers in the U.S. solar market. Qcells, another major producer, recently faced customs delays on components and furloughed workers in Georgia.

Why does this matter right now?

On September 30, 2025, the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles vanished. No fanfare, no final countdown. For the EV industry, this is more than a fiscal shift; it’s a signal that growth now must stand on its own.

Research from Gartner Inc. notes EV shipments will grow in 2025, but subsidies won’t drive the next wave. The International Energy Agency reports that global EV production reached 17.3 million in 2024, with China accounting for much of that volume. Meanwhile, charging networks, pricing strategies, and consumer perceptions still present real hurdles. This is a now-or-never pivot for EVs in markets like the U.S.

How does it compare to rivals?

Consider the four models shaping the next chapter. The 2026 Nissan Leaf starts at about $29,900, offers ~250 miles of range, and has newly updated battery chemistry. It’s aimed at everyday buyers, not early-adopter trophy seekers. The Volkswagen ID. Buzz arrives as a three-row electric people-carrier with ~260 miles of range, 282 hp, and a cabin styled to turn heads, though at around $60,000 it demands a premium. The Ford Mustang Mach-E GT focuses on excitement: 480 hp, 634 lb-ft torque, 0–60 ~3.6 s, range ~250 miles, and 0% financing, rather than tax credits, as Ford’s incentive. Then the Audi A6 e-tron represents tech-luxury: up to ~321 miles range, 270 kW fast charging, panoramic OLED displays, and air suspension. In effect, affordable, fun, aspirational, and premium all co-exist. Yet the real competition is no longer just EV vs EV, it’s EV vs internal combustion, used car inflows, and hybrid crossover pressure. Value and infrastructure will decide winners.

If you’re an urban commuter looking for an affordable electric vehicle, the Leaf makes clear sense. Minimal frills but solid value. If you’re a family needing flexibility and want a bit of flair, the ID. Buzz offers personality and utility, assuming the higher price fits. If you crave performance, the Mach-E GT delivers, but keep in mind its firm ride, higher cost per mile, and less range than some might hope.

If luxury, tech sophistication, and status are your key metrics, the A6 e-tron delivers, but for a price. Conversely, if you live in a rural area without reliable fast chargers, or you’re on a tight budget where used models or hybrids dominate your choices, you might consider waiting.

Tesla’s applications to open stores in Bismarck and Fargo, filed in 2024, were denied because state law prohibits vehicle manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.
Tesla, however, has appealed, claiming it should be exempt from the law since its sales model relies exclusively on direct-to-consumer sales throughout the United States.
Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Michael Pitcher, however, argued that the exemptions in state law do not apply to Tesla.
North Dakota and Louisiana have some of the lowest EV adoption rates, with electric vehicles accounting for just 1.3% and 1.4% of new car sales, respectively.","Tesla is suing North Dakota’s Department of Transportation after it has rejected its applications to open direct-to-consumer showrooms in the state.

The information was first revealed by The Bismarck Tribune, according to which the lawsuit was filed in August, with the first hearings scheduled for December.

Tesla’s applications to open stores in Bismarck and Fargo, filed in 2024, were denied because state law prohibits vehicle manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.

The state argues that this separation between manufacturers and dealerships is necessary to protect both franchise dealers and consumers.

Tesla, however, has appealed, claiming it should be exempt from the law since its sales model relies exclusively on direct-to-consumer sales throughout the United States.

Not a “Manufacturer”

The company argued that it does not technically meet the definition of a “manufacturer” because it does not sell new vehicles through third-party dealerships.

According to the lawsuit, North Dakota law defines a “manufacturer” as “any person who manufactures, assembles, or imports and sells new motor vehicles to new vehicle dealers for resale in the state.”

The company contends that even if it fits this definition, it should still be allowed to seek an exemption from the Department of Transportation, which permits manufacturers to operate a dealership if no independent dealer is available.

“Traditional motor vehicle manufacturers sell their vehicles through independent franchised dealers. Tesla, by contrast, sells its vehicles directly to customers throughout the United States,” the company wrote.

“As a result, Tesla has no franchised dealerships in any state,” the legal filings showed.

Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Michael Pitcher, however, argued that the exemptions in state law do not apply to Tesla.

They are intended only for temporary situations, such as when a manufacturer cannot immediately take over an existing dealership, in order to prevent market disruptions.

Tesla, by contrast, was seeking to establish its own permanent dealerships.

Unconstitutionality Claims

Tesla alleges that the Department of Transportation’s rejection violates the North Dakota Constitution, citing clauses that protect the “right to earn a livelihood” and the “right to equal protection.”

According to Tesla, North Dakota’s law unconstitutionally favors franchise dealerships.

“To the extent that the North Dakota Legislature or the Department seek to protect franchised dealerships from competition, that is not a reasonable legislative goal,” the filings read.

The Assistant Attorney General countered that establishing a franchise system is a legitimate way for the state Legislature to protect vehicle dealerships and does not infringe on any constitutional rights.

“North Dakota’s laws are not designed to shield dealers from competition per se, but from exploitation by manufacturers who could otherwise undercut them,” Pitcher wrote, adding that “Tesla, as a manufacturer, falls squarely within that concern.”

Direct Sales Ban in Other States

North Dakota isn’t the first state where Tesla has challenged dealership laws. The company has also filed petitions against similar direct-sales bans in Louisiana, Wisconsin, and several other states.

North Dakota and Louisiana have some of the lowest EV adoption rates, with electric vehicles accounting for just 1.3% and 1.4% of new car sales, respectively.

Only Mississippi is lower, at 1.2%.

By contrast, California — the state with the highest adoption rate — saw electric vehicles make up 29% of new car sales in the third quarter.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tesla_Lincoln.webp,N,,2025-11-17 13:03:53.899416

Across all rulemakings, federal agencies published roughly $2 billion in total cost savings and cut 7.1 million paperwork burden hours.
The agency estimates that this will produce roughly $171 million and 3.6 million hours in cost and paperwork reductions annually.
Extrapolated across a 10-year period under a 7-percent discount rate, this means roughly $1.2 billion in total savings[1].
Utilizing a somewhat different set of calculations than the 2023 iteration, EPA now estimates the total cost reductions from these proposed changes “to be approximately $786-$843 million,” with the average estimate being roughly $815 million.","The major policy news last week was, of course, that the longest government shutdown in U.S. history ended. Throughout the week, however, agencies were still very much in shutdown mode. As such, federal rulemaking output continued to be minimal with only three actions that contained any measurable effects. But what this cohort lacked in numbers, it more than made up for in impact. Proposed rules from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeking to roll-back certain Biden-era rules were the main items of the week, bringing sizable estimated cost and paperwork reductions. Across all rulemakings, federal agencies published roughly $2 billion in total cost savings and cut 7.1 million paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 7

Final Rules: 13

2025 Total Pages: 50,961

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$74.1 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$627.9 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week comes in the form of the proposed rule from CFPB regarding “Small Business Lending Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B).” Under this proposal, the agency “is reconsidering coverage of certain credit transactions and financial institutions; the small business definition; inclusion of certain data points and how others are collected; and the compliance date.” Specifically, CFPB is revisiting a 2023 rule on the matter. The agency estimates that this will produce roughly $171 million and 3.6 million hours in cost and paperwork reductions annually. Extrapolated across a 10-year period under a 7-percent discount rate, this means roughly $1.2 billion in total savings[1].

The other significant rulemaking of the week comes in the proposed rule from EPA on “Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Data Reporting and Recordkeeping Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); Revision to Regulation.” As the title suggests, the proposal seeks to make “amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulation for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).” Incidentally, the requirements in question also stem from a 2023 rule. This current proposal would all but wipe out the reporting requirements and their ensuing costs. Utilizing a somewhat different set of calculations than the 2023 iteration, EPA now estimates the total cost reductions from these proposed changes “to be approximately $786-$843 million,” with the average estimate being roughly $815 million.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

There were no new broad-based regulatory policy announcements from the White House. The only document of note coming out of the Office of Management and Budget was a largely ministerial memo directing the resumption of normal agency operations in light of the end of the government shutdown. From a regulatory perspective, it seems like agencies have already stepped to it, with a more typical volume of rulemaking already flowing through the Federal Register pipelines.

Also, there were no new CRA developments. The AAF CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 68 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

Since January 1, the federal government has published $702 billion in total regulatory net cost savings (with $74.1 billion in cost savings from finalized rules) and 72.1 million hours of net annual paperwork cuts (with 48.1 million hours coming from final rules).",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/regrodeo-11-14-25.png,N,,2025-11-17 12:01:35.231664

717b) requires FERC approval for any import or export of natural gas between the U.S. and a foreign country.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled en banc in Allegheny Defense Project v. FERC that FERC cannot toll rehearing requests to approve natural gas infrastructure projects.","Building natural gas infrastructure should get easier in the future by way of a recent ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission). On October 7, 2025, FERC issued a Final Rule, entitled “Removal of Regulations Limiting Authorizations to Proceed with Construction Activities Pending Rehearing” (Docket No. RM25-9-000, 193 FERC ¶61,014 (2025)). The new rule rescinds FERC’s prior rule that barred construction on gas infrastructure during project appeals. In doing so, FERC plans to accelerate energy projects to meet the growing demand for energy, due in part to the rapid build-out of data centers.

FERC Order No. 871 is a Biden-era rule that delayed construction of approved natural gas projects during the 30-day rehearing request period, or while such rehearing requests were pending. In other words, natural gas construction could not start if a party seeks rehearing of the order authorizing construction of the project for as long as the rehearing process continues. This also has meant that some projects were tolled up to 150 days for a potential rehearing request, even if no rehearing request was ultimately filed.

This Order responds to increased interest and stakeholder participation in sections 3 and 7 proceedings under the Natural Gas Act (NGA). NGA section 3 (15 U.S.C. 717b) requires FERC approval for any import or export of natural gas between the U.S. and a foreign country. Section 7 (15 U.S.C. 717f(c) and (e)) mandates that FERC only issue a certificate of a proposed pipeline if “required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.” Order No. 871 ensured that stakeholders, particularly affected landowners and community members, had a right to have their concerns fully heard and decided before construction of a pipeline could begin.

Challenges to FERC Order No. 871

Shortly after Order No. 871 was issued in 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled en banc in Allegheny Defense Project v. FERC that FERC cannot toll rehearing requests to approve natural gas infrastructure projects. The court held that doing so contravenes the NGA, which provides that if FERC does not act on a rehearing request in 30 days, the request is deemed denied.

After President Trump took office in 2025, FERC reversed course on its policy. On June 18, 2025, FERC approved a one-year temporary waiver of Order No. 871, pausing regulation enforcement through June 30, 2026. In addition, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to permanently rescind Order No. 871.

On October 7, 2025, FERC permanently revoked Order No. 871, lifting the bar on construction activities on gas infrastructure while approvals are being challenged. In the final rule, FERC stated that, “Based on these considerations and given the commission’s command pursuant to the [NGA] to encourage the orderly development of plentiful supplies of natural gas, the commission concludes that [Order No. 871] is no longer in the public interest.”

The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America commended FERC’s actions, stating that this will “expedite pipeline construction following issuance of a FERC certificate without delay…and provide[] added regulatory certainty for our members on their investments in needed natural gas infrastructure.”

Broader Implications of FERC’s Scrapping of Order No. 871

FERC’s repeal of Order No. 871 is just the latest of a series of rollbacks by the Trump Administration that seek to streamline the development of natural gas infrastructure. For example, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” directing the removal of regulatory burdens on energy projects, especially natural gas projects. On the same day, President Trump declared a national energy emergency, highlighting the importance of critical energy infrastructure for national and economic security.

Tied to national security is the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). And as AI data centers boom, the transmission grid needs to catch up. As such, on July 23, 2025, the Trump Administration published America’s AI Action Plan (the Plan). The Plan aims to simplify permitting for energy infrastructure and to accelerate construction of AI infrastructure. Along with this Plan, the Administration released Executive Order 14318, expediting the permitting process for energy projects, including natural gas pipelines.

What’s Coming Down the Pipeline

By removing restrictions on natural gas construction activities, FERC aims to accelerate energy projects to meet the demands of a growing world and the boom of AI data centers. While this move promises greater certainty and speed for pipeline projects, it also signals a broader trend toward streamlining energy infrastructure permitting under the Trump administration. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, stakeholders should remain vigilant, monitoring new policies and legal challenges that could impact future natural gas projects and the broader energy sector.

Cobalt Mining Effects on Children

More than 70% of the world’s cobalt is mined in the DRC, with a significant share extracted in the southeastern provinces of Lualaba and Haut-Katanga. See From Cobalt to Cars: How China Exploits Child and Forced Labor in DR Congo: Hearing Before the Cong.-Exec. Comm’n on China, 118th Cong. (Nov. 14, 2023). These regions include the mining-intensive cities of Kolwezi and Lubumbashi, where cobalt extraction dominates the local economy. In this part of the country, children face daily exposure to hazardous substances—through direct labor in cobalt mines and environmental contamination in nearby communities. See Amnesty Int’l, This Is What We Die For: Human Rights Abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Power the Global Trade in Cobalt 19–33 (2016). An estimated 35,000 to 40,000 children live or work near mining sites, many of them digging ore from narrow tunnels, hauling heavy sacks of raw cobalt, and handling minerals without gloves, masks, or access to clean water. See From Cobalt to Cars, supra. Thousands more suffer indirect exposure by inhaling cobalt-laden dust or drinking water from rivers and wells contaminated by mining runoff. See Karly Domb Sadof et al., The Hidden Costs of Cobalt Mining, Wash. Post, Feb. 28, 2018.

Despite mounting evidence from medical researchers, environmental scientists, and human rights organizations documenting cobalt’s toxic effects on human health, these conditions have persisted with little meaningful intervention. The environmental health crisis unfolding across the DRC’s mining regions is not an unforeseen consequence of rapid mineral extraction: It is the predictable outcome of weak legal enforcement, fragmented oversight, and the failure of both domestic and international systems to safeguard vulnerable communities. This section examines the environmental consequences cobalt mining imposes on Congolese children, particularly those linked to informal mining and broader governance failures.

The most acute human health risks arise in the context of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), that is, operations that rely on manual extraction with minimal mechanization and virtually no government oversight. See U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Forced Labor in Cobalt Mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 2–5, 22, 27–30 (May 2023). Although many ASM sites are loosely organized by traders, intermediaries, or cooperative leaders, these operations often remain informal or illegal, operating outside the regulatory framework governing industrial mining and providing little to no protection for workers or nearby residents. Id. In the cobalt sector, ASM accounts for an estimated 15 to 30% of national production and supports thousands of families. See Dorothée Baumann-Pauly, Cobalt Mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Addressing Root Causes of Human Rights Abuses 3, 5 (N.Y.U. Stern Ctr. for Bus. & Hum. Rts. & Geneva Ctr. for Bus. & Hum. Rts., Feb. 2023). These sites, often dug by hand, lack reinforcement, ventilation, or safety protocols and frequently collapse.

As children dig, crush, sort, and wash cobalt ore, they inhale toxic dust and come into frequent contact with contaminated soil and water—exposures that typically occur without masks, gloves, or other basic personal protective equipment. See Amnesty Int’l, This Is What We Die For, supra, at 19–30. Prolonged inhalation of cobalt-mining dust can lead to hard metal lung disease and other respiratory ailments, while repeated interaction with polluted soil, dust, and water exposes children to uranium, lead, and other toxic metals that commonly occur alongside cobalt deposits and are released into the environment during ore extraction and processing. See Fleur Scheele et al., Cobalt Blues: Environmental Pollution and Human Rights Violations in Katanga’s Copper and Cobalt Mines 21–26 (Centre for Rsch. on Multinational Corp. 2016). Combined exposure to these metals can heighten toxic effects, increasing the overall health risks for those living and working in mining areas. See C. L. N. Banza et al., Sustainability of Artisanal Mining of Cobalt in DR Congo, 1 Nat. Sustainability 495, 498–99 (2018). Scientific studies in communities near artisanal cobalt mines have documented elevated concentrations of these metals in children’s blood and urine, with biomarkers indicating systemic toxicity, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. Id. Such health outcomes are not anomalies—they reflect widespread, predictable consequences of ASM’s unregulated nature and the government’s failure to implement health-protective regulation.

Beyond acute respiratory and toxicological symptoms, chronic exposure to cobalt and associated heavy metals poses serious long-term risks to children’s health in affected mining regions. See Connor W. Brown et al., Occupational, Environmental, and Toxicological Health Risks of Mining Metals for Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Narrative Review of the PubMed Database, 19 J. Occupational Med. & Toxicology 35, 37 (2024). Children are especially vulnerable due to higher absorption rates, immature detoxification systems, and frequent hand-to-mouth behaviors that increase exposure to mining pollutants. See RAID & AFREWATCH, Beneath the Green: A Critical Look at the Environmental and Human Costs of Industrial Cobalt Mining in DRC 40 (Mar. 2024). Compounding these dangers are malnutrition, unsanitary living conditions, and limited access to medical care. See Amnesty Int’l, This Is What We Die For, supra, at 23–24, 30–32. For many children, long hours in or near mining sites replace time in school, reinforcing cycles of poverty and ill health. Id. at 28–32.

Nowhere are these environmental health risks more visible than in Kolwezi, where artisanal sites operate just steps from homes, schools, and markets. In neighborhoods like Kasulo, families live amid open pits, metal-laden waste, and clouds of dust. See Todd C. Frankel, The Cobalt Pipeline: Tracing the Path from Deadly Hand-Dug Mines in Congo to Consumers’ Phones and Laptops, Wash. Post, Sept. 30, 2016. A 2018 study found that children living near these sites had urinary cobalt levels more than 10 times higher than those in non-mining areas, with elevated levels of uranium and manganese as well. See Banza et al., supra, at 498–99. Researchers found signs of toxic exposure even among children not directly engaged in mining, illustrating how environmental contamination affects entire communities, not just those working in the mines. Id. at 500–01. In Kolwezi, as in other mining communities, families face stark choices: expose their children to toxic environments in exchange for income or slip deeper into poverty. These conditions persist with little oversight—underscoring how the DRC’s cobalt economy externalizes its environmental and health costs onto its most vulnerable residents.

Cobalt Supply Chains and Global Accountability

The environmental harms facing Congolese mining communities are not simply by-products of weak enforcement—they are embedded in a transnational supply chain that obscures origin, fragments responsibility, and rewards opacity. Although the DRC produces most of the world’s cobalt, the path from mine to market is shaped by layers of intermediaries, refiners, and manufacturers whose geographic and legal distance from extraction sites renders accountability elusive. China is at the center of this structure, controlling the vast majority of cobalt refining capacity and holding significant stakes in the DRC’s most productive mines. This concentration of power enables downstream firms to source cobalt at scale while avoiding direct engagement with the conditions of its extraction, deepening the disconnect between environmental justice principles and global resource governance.

Chinese companies now own or control stakes in at least 15 of the 19 largest industrial cobalt operations in the DRC, including some of the country’s highest-output mines. See Patrick Anderson, Cobalt and Corruption: The Influence of Multinational Firms and Foreign States on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 14 J. Glob. Bus. & Cmty. 1, 2, 7–9 (2023). Firms such as China Molybdenum, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and Sinohydro have secured long-term access through joint ventures with state-owned Congolese companies and opaque acquisitions brokered over the past two decades. Id. at 7–9. These companies often indirectly rely on subcontractors and intermediaries to source cobalt, including material from artisanal mining sites. See Matthieu Bolay & Filipe Calvão, Labour, Incorporated: Dependent Contracting and Wageless Work in Africa’s “Responsible” Mines, 62 Cahiers d’Études Africaines, no. 245/246 (1/2), 2022, at 123, 134–36. Once extracted, most raw cobalt is exported to China for refining and processing. See Suleyman O. Altiparmak et al., Cornering the Market with Foreign Direct Investments: China’s Cobalt Politics, 7 Renewable & Sustainable Energy Transition, art. 100113, at 5–6 (2025). By 2024, Chinese refineries handled approximately 83% of global cobalt output—up from 65% in 2018—and the six largest refiners globally are all Chinese. See Jon Emont, How China Beat Out the U.S. to Become the Top Player in Rare-Earths Refining, Wall St. J., Mar. 24, 2025. From there, cobalt enters manufacturing chains that supply battery producers and end-users across North America, Europe, and Asia. See U.S. Energy Info. Admin., China Dominates Global Trade of Battery Minerals (May 21, 2025). This vertically integrated model consolidates China’s control over sourcing and processing while creating multiple degrees of separation between multinational buyers and extraction sites—particularly those reliant on artisanal or unregulated labor. The resulting structure generates an accountability gap that obscures the true human and environmental costs of the global cobalt trade.

This arrangement allows multinational firms to benefit from Congolese cobalt while remaining insulated from the conditions under which it is mined. Brands such as Apple, Tesla, Samsung, and General Motors remain heavily reliant on cobalt processed through predominantly Chinese-controlled channels, where sourcing practices are often unclear and weakly regulated. See RAID & CAJJ, The Road to Ruin? Electric Vehicles and Workers’ Rights Abuses at DR Congo’s Industrial Cobalt Mines 6, 14, 18–19, 25–28, 60, 65 (Nov. 2021). While these companies typically do not purchase directly from ASM sites, they profit from a procurement system in which cobalt extracted under hazardous and exploitative conditions is indistinguishably blended into global supply. See Siddharth Kara, Cobalt Red: How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives (2023). In 2019, several Congolese families filed suit in Doe v. Apple Inc., alleging that Apple, Alphabet, Dell, Microsoft, and Tesla had “knowingly benefited” from forced child labor in cobalt mines operated by their suppliers. The complaint described children working underground for as little as two dollars a day, exposed to tunnel collapses and toxic dust without protective equipment. The suit was ultimately dismissed on procedural grounds, including lack of standing and difficulty establishing direct causation—highlighting the structural challenges of imposing liability on downstream firms. See Compl. ¶¶ 5–8, Doe v. Apple Inc., No. 1:19-cv-03737 (D.D.C. Dec. 16, 2019).

Many companies cite supplier audits, traceability initiatives, and voluntary certification schemes as evidence of ethical sourcing. Yet, these mechanisms often fail to detect or deter the flow of cobalt from unregulated ASM operations. Certification programs—such as the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process—rely heavily on self-reporting and limited third-party verification, methods ill-suited to fragmented, transnational supply chains. See Galit A. Sarfaty & Raphael Deberdt, Supply Chain Governance at a Distance, 49 Law & Soc. Inquiry 1036, 1046–53 (2024). In practice, corporate actors operate within systems where legal responsibility is diffused, while profits remain concentrated. Public commitments to responsible sourcing frequently coexist with procurement practices that externalize social and environmental risks onto those at the base of the supply chain. Id. at 1052–53.

Recent U.S. and European initiatives aim to correct structural imbalances in the global cobalt trade. The U.S. Department of State’s Minerals Security Partnership promotes secure and resilient supply chains by supporting investment in critical minerals projects in resource-rich nations and recently endorsed principles for high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. Similarly, the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act introduces mechanisms to diversify sourcing and improve transparency. While these policies signal a shift toward greater market resilience, they remain in early stages and focus primarily on securing material access—not labor protections, environmental safeguards, or governance reforms in producer countries. Unless accompanied by parallel efforts to formalize ASM, combat corruption, and strengthen local enforcement, supply chain restructuring risks becoming a geopolitical strategy that marginalizes the communities most affected by extraction.

Global awareness of cobalt’s human costs is growing, and reform efforts are becoming more visible. But without robust legal accountability and investment in equitable governance at the source, the harms embedded in cobalt supply chains will continue to fall on Congolese mining communities, particularly children, even as global markets reap the rewards.

Legal and Regulatory Gaps in Cobalt Governance

Despite the severity of environmental and labor abuses in the DRC’s cobalt mining sector, international human rights law remains ill-equipped to address these harms. Key instruments, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Labour Organization’s Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, establish standards but lack enforcement mechanisms. The CRC relies on mandatory periodic reporting rather than adjudicatory remedies. See U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3. Convention No. 182 depends on domestic implementation and provides no international complaints mechanism or private right of action for victims. Similarly, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are nonbinding and impose no legal obligations on companies. Advocacy efforts to develop a binding treaty on business and human rights or to codify “ecocide” under the Rome Statute have gained traction but remain politically stalled. See Joe Udell, Environmental Destruction and Human Rights Abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Examining the Epicenter of the Cobalt Mining Industry from an International Criminal Law Perspective, 32 Minn. J. Int’l L. 195, 198–200, 212–13, 215–16 (2023).

While international frameworks remain aspirational, the implementation of mining regulations in the DRC presents its own systemic failures. The 2018 Mining Code includes provisions to formalize ASM, protect workers, and establish designated artisanal mining zones (Zones d’Exploitation Artisanale, ZEAs), but enforcement remains sporadic and ineffective. Most artisanal miners continue to operate in unregulated conditions, as ZEAs either do not exist or lack meaningful oversight—leaving workers vulnerable to hazardous conditions, extortion, and violence. SAEMAPE, the agency tasked with supporting and monitoring artisanal mining, often lacks the resources to inspect sites or enforce safety protocols. See Emmanuel Umpula et al., Islands of Responsibility? Corporate Sourcing of Artisanal Cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Int’l Inst. for Env’t & Dev. 10–11, 18–19 (2021).

Corruption and institutional weakness further undermine oversight. In 2019, the government created two new institutions: the Entreprise Générale du Cobalt (EGC), tasked with formalizing artisanal cobalt purchasing, and the Autorité de Régulation et de Contrôle des Marchés des Substances Minérales Stratégiques (ARECOMS), charged with overseeing strategic mineral exports. Both were designed to improve traceability and curb illicit trade. Nevertheless, oversight remains weak despite these mandates. EGC has failed to stem illegal mining or smuggling, while ARECOMS continues to face operational challenges due to limited capacity and persistent corruption. See Aymeric Vincenot, DR Congo Bets on Cobalt Export Freeze to Halt Price Tumble, Agence France-Presse (Mar. 9, 2025). A 2025 study on environmental crime and mineral governance found that informal mining in the DRC remains largely beyond government control. See Zeynab Malakouti & Mohammad Hazrati, Interconnected Challenges: Examining the Nexus of Environmental Crime and Money Laundering in the Context of Energy Transition, 8 J. Econ. Criminol., art. 100151, at 4 (2025). Cobalt from unregulated sites routinely enters the global supply chain, aided by falsified documentation, official collusion, and bribes paid to border officials. See Henry Lazenby, Middlemen Siphon Billions from War-Ravaged DRC’s Cobalt, Coltan Trade, Mining.com (Feb. 10, 2025). According to a 2024 ENACT Observer report, the DRC loses nearly $1 billion annually to smuggling into Rwanda alone. See Oluwole Ojewale, Illegal Cobalt Mining Taints Transition to Green Technology, ENACT Observer (May 27, 2024). These failures not only erode the rule of law but also allow multinationals to source Congolese cobalt with little assurance that it was mined ethically or legally.

As domestic enforcement falters, transnational legal tools have been used to pursue corporate accountability. Chief among them is the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits bribing foreign officials for business advantage. In 2022, Glencore International AG, a multinational mining and commodities trading company, pleaded guilty to bribing Congolese officials in exchange for access to cobalt and copper concessions. See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Just., Glencore Entered Guilty Pleas to Foreign Bribery and Market Manipulation Schemes (May 24, 2022). Yet, the case focused narrowly on financial misconduct and failed to address the broader labor and environmental abuses linked to Glencore’s operations. This narrow prosecutorial focus on bribery, rather than the broader supply chain abuses, reflects a deeper limitation in transnational enforcement: While bribery can trigger prosecution, systemic harms embedded in global supply chains often escape legal scrutiny. See Udell, supra, at 229–30.

Recent enforcement trends have further narrowed the reach of the FCPA. While early applications of the statute targeted systemic corporate misconduct, more recent cases have focused on individual executive culpability, often addressing discrete acts of bribery rather than broader patterns of abuse in global operations. See Veronica A. Guerrero et al., FCPA Enforcement: Back with a Twist? DOJ Issues New FCPA Guidelines Following Trump Executive Order, Arnold & Porter (June 11, 2025). This shift was previewed in February 2025, when an executive order directed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to pause new FCPA enforcement actions pending a policy review. See Exec. Order 14,209, Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security, 90 Fed. Reg. 9587, 9588 (Feb. 14, 2025). Citing concerns about economic competitiveness and supply chain security, the directive raised alarm among anticorruption advocates who feared it signaled a broader retreat from corporate accountability abroad. Although the pause was lifted in June 2025, new DOJ guidance narrowed enforcement priorities to cases implicating U.S. strategic interests (such as critical minerals and national security), while deemphasizing broader corporate misconduct. See Memorandum from U.S. Dep’t of Just., Guidelines for Investigations and Enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (June 9, 2025). This change in focus has diminished the FCPA’s deterrent power, particularly in sectors like cobalt mining, where harms arise not from isolated acts of bribery but from structural conditions of environmental degradation, forced labor, and unclear supply chains.

In the absence of binding legal mandates, corporations have turned to voluntary initiatives to demonstrate ethical compliance. Programs such as the Cobalt Industry Responsible Assessment Framework and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Due Diligence Guidance promote supply chain accountability but rely primarily on company self-reporting, with limited independent oversight or enforcement. Membership or participation is typically not revoked for noncompliance unless the failure is egregious or publicly exposed, leaving implementation effectively self-managed. These frameworks often prioritize reputational risk management over systemic reform, enabling companies to project a façade of ethical sourcing while distancing themselves from labor and environmental conditions at the extraction stage. See Umpula et al., supra, at 4. Many shift the burden of compliance onto local suppliers or third-party auditors, creating fragmented oversight with limited transparency. See Filipe Calvão et al., Cobalt Mining and the Corporate Outsourcing of Responsibility in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 8 Extractive Indus. & Soc’y, no. 4, 2021, art. 100884, at 8–9. In practice, this outsourcing of responsibility has enabled cobalt from hazardous and unregulated artisanal sites to enter global markets under the veneer of due diligence. Id. at 5–6, 8–9.

These layered failures—across international law, domestic governance, transnational enforcement, and corporate policy—create a global accountability vacuum where human rights and environmental harms persist unchecked. International legal instruments remain nonbinding or aspirational; domestic regulators in the DRC struggle with corruption, weak capacity, and institutional underperformance; and transnational tools like the FCPA are narrowly applied or temporarily paused. At the same time, voluntary corporate frameworks often allow companies to claim compliance even though oversight of upstream labor and environmental conditions at cobalt mining sites remains weak. See Amnesty Int’l, Time to Recharge: Corporate Action and Inaction to Tackle Abuses in the Cobalt Supply Chain 5–6, 8–9, 75 (2017). Absent mechanisms that align legal authority with corporate behavior, the inequities of the DRC’s cobalt economy will continue to fall on those least empowered to resist them.

Toward Accountability and Reform

Addressing the environmental health crisis linked to cobalt mining in the DRC requires more than market diversification or voluntary oversight. Legal and policy reforms must put the rights and health of affected communities at the center while closing the accountability gaps that enable global supply chains to profit from harm. The following measures, grounded in environmental justice and regulatory equity, offer a path forward.

First, domestic enforcement in the DRC must be strengthened through sustained investment in institutions tasked with overseeing artisanal mining. Agencies such as SAEMAPE and ARECOMS need stable funding, technical capacity, and operational independence to monitor mine sites, enforce safety standards, and trace mineral flows. The formalization of ASM—long promised but rarely realized—should be treated not as a bureaucratic benchmark, but as a human rights imperative. International donors and development banks can support these efforts by conditioning infrastructure and mineral-sector financing on transparent enforcement benchmarks and anticorruption safeguards.

Second, the United States should restore and expand the substantive reach of the FCPA. Future enforcement should move beyond transactional bribery to address broader patterns of misconduct, including environmental harm, labor exploitation, and corruption embedded in transnational supply chains. Given the extraterritorial nature of cobalt sourcing and mineral trade, U.S. efforts should be coordinated with complementary frameworks such as the UK Bribery Act and emerging European corporate accountability legislation.

Third, governments in cobalt-importing countries should replace voluntary sourcing frameworks with mandatory due diligence requirements. Recent EU legislation requiring companies to assess and address human rights and environmental risks across their supply chains provides a model. In the United States, disclosure-based laws—such as the Dodd-Frank conflict minerals provision—could be expanded to include cobalt, with specific attention to child labor, toxic exposure, and traceability gaps. Companies that fail to conduct meaningful risk assessments, or that knowingly source from unregulated artisanal mining sites, should face enforceable legal consequences.

Fourth, affected communities must have a voice in monitoring and remedy efforts. Civil society organizations and community-based observers in cobalt mining regions should be funded and empowered to report abuses, monitor site conditions, and provide ground-level feedback on whether sourcing practices reflect local realities. Community participation in oversight initiatives and grievance processes is essential to establish legitimacy and build trust. To root these systems in local perspectives, international minerals partnerships should require Congolese civil society representation in governance structures and ensure community members have access to complaint mechanisms that yield meaningful outcomes.

Finally, supply chain resilience must be redefined to include environmental health and human rights. Policies promoting critical mineral security—whether through domestic production, stockpiling, or foreign investment—also should embed standards for safe working conditions, pollution prevention, and child protection. Public and private procurement frameworks should incorporate environmental justice criteria into supplier eligibility, rewarding firms that demonstrate ethical sourcing at the ground level.

As the world accelerates toward a clean energy future, the urgency of securing critical minerals must not eclipse the rights of those most harmed by their extraction. In cobalt-rich regions of the DRC, children continue to suffer toxic and exploitative consequences of a supply chain built for efficiency, not accountability. These harms are not inevitable. They stem from legal failures, weak enforcement, and corporate structures that obscure responsibility. Ensuring that environmental progress does not come at the cost of human dignity requires more than due diligence checklists or corporate pledges of ethical sourcing. It demands enforceable laws, equitable oversight, and sustained international engagement with the communities that power the transition. Only by closing legal and accountability gaps can the energy transition fulfill its promise of equity as well as sustainability.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/editorial/16x9/16x9-editorial-mine-congo-child-57575632.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:04:46.456548

While both political parties are taken to task in the book, blue states and Democratic policies are a focus from a left-of-center perspective. Whether it is the inability to build high-speed rail in the country, the failure to develop energy generation and transmission projects to meet surging energy demand and mitigate climate change, or being incapable of constructing new housing at a pace to tackle cost of living concerns, the status quo is not working. Further, Klein and Thompson argue that these failings have political implications, with Democratic elected officials losing voters’ trust because of governing failures in blue cities and states. The issues highlighted in the book are at the core of the work of many Section members, and the expectation is that abundance-related policy and politics will remain center stage in the near term.

One Klein and Thompson criticism is that environmental and similar laws, while necessary, have become focused on process over outcome. An abundance agenda seeks to reform government (e.g., loosening zoning laws, simplifying environmental permitting, speeding up infrastructure projects) to focus on building and innovation as central to liberal governance. This approach requires honesty that there are trade-offs involved. For example, advancing infrastructure projects more quickly may result in greater localized environmental impacts, or NIMBY opposition to housing density may need to take a back seat to the greater public benefit of more and cheaper homes in blue states.

Climate change is an example of our inability to tackle big problems. There is simply no scenario where the U.S. both can meet surging energy demand due to data centers and emerging AI technologies and mitigate climate change without a historic and herculean effort to build the necessary energy infrastructure. The Biden administration prioritized climate change unlike any prior administration. Congress passed historic legislation providing hundreds of billions of dollars to build the necessary infrastructure. However, the federal government and blue state approach to environmental reviews and permitting for the necessary infrastructure did not align with those policy goals and the claimed urgency. The U.S. must build more and at unprecedented speed, scale, and scope. Klein and Thompson argue that Democratic elected officials should shift toward supporting pro-growth and development policies, particularly in the energy sector. Politicians who want to enact ambitious government programs need to show voters they are capable of implementing such programs.

Nowhere is this policy and political shift more apparent than in California, where Governor Newsom and other elected officials have adopted abundance-focused policies. When signing legislation to limit the applicability of the California Environmental Quality Act to housing development, Governor Newsom explained, “We’re urgently embracing an abundance agenda by tearing down the barriers that have delayed new affordable housing and infrastructure for decades.” Newsom also signed legislation lifting the moratorium on carbon dioxide pipelines, which are critical for carbon capture and sequestration projects, and signed legislation to authorize the development of additional oil and gas resources in the state. Notably, not all Democratic elected officials support the abundance movement, and there is certainly NGO and other opposition.

The differing opinions on the abundance movement preview potential political fault lines within the Democratic Party, which may have electoral but also practical implications on public policy priorities relevant to Section members and our clients. The lasting power of the abundance movement may impact the ability to push necessary infrastructure development, thereby restoring public faith in the role of government to provide a foundation for the county to tackle big problems.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-powerlines-1341067698.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:02.047044

The immune system and thyroid function can be compromised, and liver and kidney diseases are more likely, as are reproductive and infant development issues. S.E. Fenton et al., Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Toxicity and Human Health Review: Current State of Knowledge and Strategies for Informing Future Research, 40 Env’t Toxicology & Chemistry 606 (2021). Certain types of cancer are also more prevalent with PFAS exposure. While research on these effects is ongoing, the present understanding of these effects is that they are chronic, except in cases of extremely high exposure. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency (EPA), Our Current Understanding of the Human Health and Environmental Risks of PFAS (2024). Higher exposures in adults are generally associated with occupational risks, such as industrial workers or firefighters who produce and use PFAS products consistently. The risk of high-level exposure in children presents a different, more concerning issue.

Because children are smaller than adults, the relative concentration of contaminants to body size presents a more significant health risk. Further, young children are more likely to be exposed to PFAS-derived products while crawling and putting objects in their mouths. These exposures can lead to developmental effects or delays, variation in bone growth, puberty changes, and even behavioral issues. These effects may be subtle and widespread across populations who are exposed, even at relatively low levels, to PFAS in their environment and drinking water. Jennifer L. Ames, Vanshika Sharma & Kristen Lyall, Effects of Early-life PFAS Exposure on Child Neurodevelopment: A Review of the Evidence and Research Gaps, 12 Current Env’t Health Rep. 9 (2025). While we are still working to assess the social correlates of PFAS contamination, we would expect them to correlate to patterns of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, as do other categories of drinking water contamination. David Switzer & Manuel P. Teodoro, Class, Race, Ethnicity, and Justice in Safe Drinking Water Compliance, 99 Soc. Sci. Q. 524 (2018). Consequently, regulation of PFAS contamination of drinking water has become a hot topic in environmental regulation broadly and environmental justice specifically.

How Is PFAS Contamination in Drinking Water Regulated?

Local drinking water utilities are governed by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f et seq. (2018). Under the SDWA, utilities are required to regularly collect samples, which are sent to a certified laboratory and tested for a variety of contaminants. Violations come in a variety of forms, but health violations are the most salient and include sample contaminant levels in excess of regulatory standards and failures to comply with treatment technique standards. The EPA regularly releases data on these violations and water utilities more generally, allowing social scientists to test for correlations between the likelihood of violations and a variety of potential causes, ranging from utility characteristics to the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic composition of the populations those utilities serve. David M. Konisky & Manuel P. Teodoro, When Governments Regulate Governments, 60 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 559 (2016). This analysis of social and demographic correlations is an effort to pursue environmental justice and address the unequal distribution of violations in areas that are poor and disproportionately made up of members of disadvantaged communities. Switzer & Teodoro, supra. Nearly 100 contaminants are currently regulated under the SDWA, with more being added all the time. PFAS constitute the most recent set of additions to the list.

In 2024, EPA established regulatory limits for PFAS contamination in drinking water under the SDWA. See PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation, 89 Fed. Reg. 32,532 (Apr. 26, 2024). The rule sets limits for six categories of PFAS compounds: four parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and PFOS, and four more categories (perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, or GenX)) individually as well as aggregated in the form of an aggregated Hazard Index, the regulatory limit for which is set to 1.0. At present, these levels are remarkably aggressive in comparison to PFAS regulations globally. This decision has faced criticism from both scientists, who question their grounding in toxicology and epidemiology, J.A. Cotruvo, S.B. Goldhaber & A.J.B. Cohen, EPA’s Unprecedented Interim Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS, 61 Groundwater 301 (2023), and industry groups, who cite high costs as a concern. A.L. Ling, Estimated Scale of Costs to Remove PFAS from the Environment at Current Emission Rates, 918 Sci. Total Env’t 170647 (2024).

This rule was promulgated under the Biden administration, and the administration’s commentary on the topic makes clear that environmental justice is to be a primary factor in implementation. EPA, Biden-Harris Administration Finalizes First-Ever National Drinking Water Standard to Protect 100M People from PFAS Pollution (2024). The Trump administration claimed credit for the rule (noting its origins in a 2019 initiative) and asserted its continued enforcement. While the Trump EPA does not explicitly reject the concept of environmental justice, broader trends at the agency indicate that environmental justice will not be a priority. EPA, EPA Announces It Will Keep Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFOA, PFOS (May 14, 2025). Instead, the Trump administration frames PFAS regulation in terms of small, rural communities, suggesting that these communities will require additional time to comply. This approach is in tension with the data on PFAS, which indicates that contamination is not as likely in less dense communities.

These regulations are designed to be gradually phased in, not taking full effect until 2029. However, testing for PFAS contamination of drinking water is already underway, and EPA has released the resultant data as part of the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule dataset, allowing analysis of PFAS contamination across a large set of drinking water utilities, as well as its correlation to social and demographic factors. EPA, Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule Data Finder (2024). As such, we can examine this issue quantitatively through an environmental justice lens to assess the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic correlates of PFAS contamination in drinking water.

Where and When Is PFAS Contamination Likely?

Environmental justice work on previously regulated contaminants under the SDWA has tended to treat all contaminants as basically identical, lumping them in together and looking at the patterns of race and ethnicity in SDWA violations in the aggregate. Switzer & Teodoro, supra. Our analysis of the new data on PFAS levels above the regulatory standard forces us to reconsider that picture. Michael A. Powell, David Switzer, & Manuel P. Teodoro, Disaggregating Disparities: Divergent Contamination in a Diverse Country, in Safe Drinking Water Act: The Next Fifty Years (Palgrave Macmillan, forthcoming). While the data on the new PFAS “Hazard Index” are too sparse for statistical analysis at this stage, we were able to analyze PFOS and PFOA contamination individually, and we found that the picture is substantially more complicated.

Our traditional understanding of the environmental justice of drinking water contamination—supported by aggregated statistical analysis—would suggest that the probability of contamination correlates positively with the percentage of a water system’s service population that is Black and/or Hispanic. Id. However, while the presence of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water is indeed positively correlated with the percent of the population served that is Black, PFOA is negatively correlated with the percent that is Hispanic. PFOS shows no significant correlation to Hispanic population. In short, PFAS is a problem primarily for Black communities, but not Hispanic ones, a fact that would not be apparent if they were aggregated with other violations of SDWA standards. Indeed, when we look specifically at nitrate contamination—usually attributable to agricultural runoff in rural areas—we find that the opposite pattern holds, and contamination is likelier for Hispanic than Black communities.

The relationship between PFAS contamination and community demographics is similarly complex. While SDWA violations in aggregate are likelier in poorer areas, the probability of PFOA contamination increases with increasing median household income and decreases as economic inequality widens—that is, PFOA contamination is most likely in wealthy communities. PFOS contamination is likeliest in very densely populated communities; however, aggregated SDWA violations are less likely in denser communities, but more likely in municipalities that serve a larger population in total (controlling for density).

Examining the characteristics of water systems likely to be contaminated with PFAS in excess of the regulatory standard hones our geography further. PFAS contamination is likeliest in older systems, possibly due to the simple fact that the stability of PFAS in the environment means that it is likeliest where it has had an opportunity to accumulate over time, and newer systems are most likely to be built in newly established communities.

In sum, PFAS contamination is disproportionately a problem for communities that are wealthy, long-established, and densely populated, with a history of heavy industry, with populations that are more Black but less Hispanic. This is in contrast not only with the pattern of SDWA violations more broadly—which are likeliest in communities that are both Black and Hispanic, with low income levels and large populations—and other categories of contaminant. Coliform, a prototypical bacterial contaminant with acute effects that lead to immediate endangerment of children, is correlated almost exclusively with population density; nitrate, which also can cause acute health issues that are particularly dangerous for infants, is likeliest in places with relatively high median income but an inequitable economic distribution. Both contaminants were regulated under the SDWA long before PFAS standards were implemented, and they remain a serious problem in many American communities.

More significantly, exposure to these “traditional” SDWA contaminants presents an emergent health threat, particularly to infants and children. The potential health effects of PFAS contamination are substantial, but they present a chronic rather than acute threat to human health, even in children, except in cases where exposure is very high. We might be tempted, in response to recent coverage of PFAS contamination and, perhaps, in search of precedent, to focus more of our energy on litigation arising from the new PFAS standards. We should take care in pursuing that impulse: While drinking water enforcement and litigation are not necessarily a zero-sum game across nearly 100 SDWA-governed contaminants, an excessive focus on PFAS may lead us to underrepresent the needs of communities whose children are in imminent danger from water tainted by more traditional contaminants that are currently less in the limelight.

As legal professionals, we also should be cognizant of the makeup of the communities we represent. Though PFAS is a significant public health issue that disproportionately impacts the Black community, it is also likeliest in communities that have the financial resources to address the issue. A disproportionate focus on PFAS contamination is, in effect, steering resources desperately needed by poor, rural communities to relatively wealthy, urban communities that likely have the ability to mitigate contamination despite a concentration of a historically disadvantaged population group, mirroring the competing frames of the PFAS rule under the Biden and Trump administrations. While the detrimental effects of PFAS on child development are significant and meaningful, a failure to address acute nitrate contamination may lead to death or permanent disability. Further, because PFAS contamination is less likely in Hispanic communities, focusing on it to the exclusion of other, less headline-grabbing contaminants may disadvantage that historically excluded group, even as Black populations benefit. While a response to the new regulations is natural, and even reasonable, we must take care not to overreact in response to novelty.

The Future of Environmental Justice in Safe Drinking Water

The new regulatory standards for PFAS contamination of drinking water arrive at a tumultuous moment for regulatory law. The recent decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), presages a foundational change to environmental governance broadly and environmental justice in drinking water specifically. Loper Bright abolished the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to give broad deference to the expertise of regulators in the implementation of legislation, in favor of the level of deference granted in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944). Under Skidmore, courts are given primacy in the interpretation of legislative ambiguity, relegating regulators to a secondary role. In effect, this reversion transfers considerable power from the bureaucracy to courts. Putting aside assessment of that decision, it has substantial ramifications for any area of regulation defined by a high level of technical expertise. While we should presume the judiciary possesses considerable technical expertise in the legal arena, those of us who attended law school know that little to no time was spent on the particulars and mechanics of various chemical compounds, to say nothing of that chemistry’s effects on complex ecological systems or human toxicology. Continuing to work in these highly technical areas will require a reallocation of time and expertise for practicing attorneys.

In short, those of us who practice law relating to drinking water contamination should work to develop a deeper level of technical knowledge and to communicate the complex realities of environmental justice to judges who may now be forced to grapple with a host of highly technical regulatory areas. Winning strategies for litigation going forward will require attorneys to be adept at not only understanding the legal ramifications, but also the underlying scientific (and social scientific) reasoning governing those decisions. More importantly, we must develop the ability to communicate these highly technical concepts clearly and concisely. Understanding and communicating the differing patterns of various SDWA contaminants in use, health implications, and social correlations will be paramount, particularly in the early stages of the post–Loper Bright world. Until courts develop their own highly expert bureaucracy, it will be incumbent on us to distill the vast complexities of social and scientific interactions in drinking water regulation to a form compelling and usable by the judiciary. These complexities will have lasting public health implications for communities of color and, in particular, children of color.

Those of us interested in environmental justice also must take on a new burden in understanding the social and political ramifications of safe drinking water regulation and litigation. We must move beyond the impulse to treat Black, Hispanic, and low-income voters as broadly aligned and aggregated and engage with the more complicated reality of difficult trade-offs between disadvantaged communities. See, e.g., Hakeem Jefferson, The Curious Case of Black “Conservatives”: Assessing the Validity of the Liberal-Conservative Scale Among Black Americans, 88 Pub. Op. Q. 909 (2024); Eileen Díaz McConnell & Daniela A. Carreon, “It’s Not About Numbers, It’s About Power”: How Latino Young Adults Imagine the Ethnic and Racial Demographic Future of the United States, Am. Behav. Sci. (2024). Not only will understanding these societal linkages be vital to winning court cases, but they also must inform the practice of environmental justice law itself. If we are to continue to be on the front lines of the environmental justice struggle and continue to harness our legal skills to protect children from environmental degradation and contamination, we need to remain cognizant of the distributive effects of the allocation of our time and effort, particularly in the pro bono and public service arenas that are focused primarily on aiding underrepresented groups and individuals otherwise without the resources to retain legal counsel. Our ability to direct resources to where they are most needed gets at our most foundational obligation to professional ethics.

Failing to do so not only has ethical ramifications, but also political ramifications. The excessive aggregation of environmental justice analysis may have feedback effects that reinforce polarized, reactionary politics. The perceived redistribution of societal benefits away from rural areas in favor of urban populations has created significant political division over the last several years. Katherine J. Cramer, The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker (Univ. of Chi. Press 2016). Further, amalgamating racial and ethnic groups despite differing patterns in the distribution of drinking water contamination is likely to breed resentment in those communities, further fracturing the political landscape. Ivelisse Cuevas-Molina, White Racial Identity, Racial Attitudes, and Latino Partisanship, 8 J. Race, Ethnicity & Pol. 469 (2023). The effect of policy on social identity is profound, particularly for children and in interaction with other categories associated with social disadvantage. Mary Elizabeth Collins & Michelle Mead, Social Constructions of Children and Youth: Beyond Dependents and Deviants, 50 J. Soc. Pol’y 493 (2021). Failing to understand and address these patterns risks the further degradation of decades of imperfect but important environmental justice advocacy and litigation.

Finally, integrating a more granular approach to environmental justice in drinking water contamination law necessitates a more localized approach. Because of the variety of patterns across the numerous types of water contaminants governed under the SDWA, effective management of contaminant issues will be most effective at a local level where mitigation can be carefully and specifically targeted. The political landscape necessitates a similar approach to advocacy; under the current Congress, presidential administration, and Supreme Court, expanding the capabilities of regulatory agencies at the federal level is unlikely to succeed, particularly where the justification is grounded in environmental justice concerns. However, because of the SDWA’s highly delegated structure, there remains considerable opportunity to engage with these issues at the state and local levels. The current administration even has signaled a willingness to permit this type of engagement, emphasizing flexibility for water systems in rural communities in complying with the new PFAS standards. EPA, EPA Announces It Will Keep Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFOA, PFOS (2025). Despite the Trump administration’s disinterest in environmental justice at the federal level, its decentralized approach to this issue may permit the persistence of environmental justice efforts at other geographic levels. Focusing on not only advocacy but also negotiation and litigation at the state and local levels is the right approach to addressing the disparate patterns of contamination.

Scaling Up State and Local Mitigation Efforts

By focusing on smaller geographic scales for enforcement, we complicate the process of achieving safer drinking water at the national scale. However, doing so is not only the correct approach to tackling PFAS contamination in drinking water, but also offers the opportunity to work upward. State and local mitigation efforts offer useful test cases that may be scaled upward, particularly in states like California, Texas, or Pennsylvania, which possess large, diverse populations and a variety of land uses. Focusing on these potentially scalable laboratories of regulation is useful for not only testing effectiveness but also scalability, maximizing the likelihood that the approaches transmit both upward—to federal policy—and outward to other states. Local, granular approaches to solving drinking water contamination are the way forward—for attorneys, for communities, and for our children.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-child-water-cup-98478537.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:07.079280

264, 622) (noting changes to the NEPA regulations for the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Federal Transit Administration); see also Fed.","These shifts, which generally portend a leaner NEPA process, come at a time when federal agencies and private sector partners are looking to achieve rapid development of data centers to meet the population’s data-processing needs. Data centers are essentially physical locations to store and process data; they also require significant amounts of energy and water. With the recent NEPA changes, data center developers and other complex project proponents may see a more streamlined NEPA process.

NEPA was the first major federal environmental law passed in the United States. It established a process that requires agencies to take a “hard look” at potential environmental impacts of their actions. NEPA applies to “proposals for . . . major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). Generally, a “major Federal action” includes any project that the federal government conducts, funds, or approves. The agencies review potential impacts through an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). EAs are relatively brief reports that agencies use to determine whether the environmental impacts of a proposed project warrant an EIS. An EIS is a lengthy and detailed report that provides a more comprehensive analysis of the project’s environmental impacts and assesses potential alternatives to the proposed project. EAs are the most common NEPA compliance tool, as most federal actions do not have a significant effect on the environment.

NEPA only dictates procedural requirements, not a particular outcome on project approval. Seven Cntys. Infrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., 145 S. Ct. 1497, 1507 (2025) (“NEPA is a purely procedural statute. . . . [It] does not require the agency to weigh environmental consequences in any particular way.”). Because litigants cannot challenge the substance of an agency’s decision via NEPA, they typically argue that noncompliance—like a failure to identify an impact or an inadequate evaluation of one—resulted in an “arbitrary and capricious” decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Where project opponents can prove procedural deficiencies, the court may remand the case for further agency proceedings, vacate the agency action, or enjoin the project. These lawsuits invariably add time and costs to a proposed project.

Despite NEPA establishing procedural requirements, the statute does not identify the exact details for fulfilling those requirements. That gap is where CEQ and federal agencies have traditionally stepped in with implementing regulations.

CEQ promulgated ubiquitous NEPA implementation regulations (now guidance). First issued in 1978, CEQ regulations specified, among other things, the required scope, timeline, and page limits of NEPA documents. Implementation of Procedural Provisions, 43 Fed. Reg. 55,978 (Nov. 29, 1978). Notably, CEQ’s implementing regulations applied to the entire federal government. Thus, any additional regulations promulgated by individual agencies had to be consistent with those already created by CEQ.

Despite CEQ regulations guiding NEPA implementation for nearly 50 years, CEQ’s authority to promulgate regulations was recently denied. In lawsuits challenging CEQ’s 2024 regulatory changes, two federal courts separately held that CEQ lacked authority to issue binding regulations. See Marin Audubon Soc’y v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 121 F.4th 902 (D.C. Cir. 2024); Iowa v. CEQ, 765 F. Supp. 3d 859 (D.N.D. 2025). Then, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14,154, Unleashing American Energy, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353 (Jan. 29, 2025), directing CEQ to propose rescinding its implementing regulations. CEQ then promulgated an interim final rule rescinding 50 years’ worth of regulations. Removal of National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 10,610 (Feb. 25, 2025).

Ahead of the rescission, CEQ issued guidance to federal agencies to help streamline each agency’s NEPA regulations. Memorandum from Katherine R. Scarlett, Chief of Staff, CEQ, on Implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act to Heads of Fed. Dep’ts & Agencies (Feb. 19, 2025) (CEQ Guidance). Notably, CEQ only issued guidance, which does not have the binding effect of regulations. CEQ’s guidance encourages agencies to develop new regulations by February 2026 (within 12 months of the guidance’s issuance). Additionally, CEQ advised that agencies may maintain current NEPA procedures, including those prescribed under the now-rescinded regulations, until their new regulations are in place. CEQ also requested that agencies use CEQ’s 2020 implementing regulations as an initial framework in developing the agencies’ new regulations. Many agencies already have responded by proposing new NEPA implementation guidance, including the Department of Energy, Department of Interior, and Army Corps of Engineers. E.g., Dep’t of Energy, Revision of National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures, 90 Fed. Reg. 29,676 (July 3, 2025) (to be codified at 10 C.F.R. pts. 205, 1021).

Despite CEQ’s rescission, NEPA’s statutory requirements remain, including those in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), Pub. L. No. 118-5, § 321, 127 Stat. 10. The FRA amended NEPA to codify select components of CEQ regulations at the time. For example, the FRA codified EIS’s 150-page limit, two-year timeline for completing the review document and the ability to allow project sponsors to prepare EISs, among other provisions. This means that despite CEQ’s rescission, those provisions mirrored in the FRA will remain applicable across the federal landscape.

With these recent judicial and executive actions, NEPA is returning to a more constrained version reminiscent of how it was in the 1970s. These actions have largely aimed for NEPA to impose less of a burden on project developers. So, what does this mean for data center developers and other project proponents moving forward?

Data centers, depending on the circumstances of the project, can trigger NEPA by requiring federal permits or permission to build on federal land. This includes when development of a site requires a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act, or other federal statutes—even if the project does not otherwise require federal funding or approval.

New data center construction also can potentially trigger NEPA through the permits or federal approvals associated with the future site’s energy and water infrastructure needs. Data centers may require large amounts of water and energy. In 2023, data centers accounted for 4.4 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and directly consumed 66 billion liters of water. Arman Shehabi et al., 2024 United States Data Center Energy Usage Report 52, 55 (2024). By 2028, data centers could use up to 12 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and 124 billion liters of water. Id.

In the short term, per CEQ guidance, ongoing and pending projects should expect few, if any, changes. CEQ Guidance at 1. For these projects, agencies can carry on as usual, relying on prior procedures and guidance.

In the near future to longer term, i.e., projects initiated after new regulations or guidance take effect, proponents could actually see a meaningful reduction in NEPA processing time. As stated above, several agencies already have proposed amended NEPA procedures. These procedures resulted from monthly meetings with CEQ to promote consistency and avoid a complex regulatory patchwork of NEPA requirements across federal agencies. These efforts appear to have had the intended effect. The new NEPA procedures generally follow the same template. However, proponents should note and track key differences, which may have implications for various projects such as allowing for greater flexibility on publishing a draft EIS for public comment or in determining federal funding triggers for qualifying federal actions. See Revision of National Environmental Policy Act Regulations, 90 Fed. Reg. 29,426 (July 3, 2025) (to be codified at 23 C.F.R. pt. 771; 49 C.F.R. pts. 264, 622) (noting changes to the NEPA regulations for the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Federal Transit Administration); see also Fed. Aviation Admin., Order 1050.1G, FAA National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures (2025). These changes could help project proponents, but how the agencies will address public comments on these procedures or ultimately administer the final NEPA requirements remains to be seen.

While there are uncertainties facing NEPA’s administration, the Supreme Court recently eased some concerns by reaffirming the “substantial judicial deference” owed federal agencies under NEPA. Seven Cntys., 145 S. Ct. at 1508. The Court’s majority was critical of NEPA challenges, stating, “Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new [] projects,” id. at 1514, and emphasized that whether an EIS was detailed enough “should not be excessively second-guessed by a court.” Id. at 1512. Notably for data center proponents, the majority placed the consideration of indirect environmental effects and cumulative effects within the sphere of agency deference. Id. at 1513. After Seven Counties, it will be more difficult to challenge federal approval of data centers by arguing that an EIS or EA failed to account for natural resource demands not directly a part of the data center project. However, the Court did not preclude NEPA litigation completely, as judicial deference to agencies does not absolve them of arbitrary and capricious actions.

With challenges still permitted, and the potential changes to NEPA regulations already taking shape, project proponents should closely track these developments with a focus on the following. First, litigants are likely to challenge new agency regulations under the APA. When CEQ revised its regulations in 2020 and 2024, lawsuits quickly followed each change. See, e.g., Wild Va. v. Council on Env’t Quality, No. 3:20-cv-00045 (W.D. Va. 2020); Iowa v. CEQ, No. 1:24-cv-00089 (D.N.D. 2024). Second, projects requiring multiagency permits may be particularly vulnerable to litigation claiming noncompliance with NEPA if agencies have to coordinate and harmonize unique requirements.

All in all, it has been a big year for NEPA, and there are more changes to come. This is a critical time, and these decisions will have lasting implications for project development. Project developers should pay close attention to these changes and engage the agencies throughout the regulatory process.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-north-dakota-2161394212.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:12.776651

15,000 PUBLIC COMMENTS: New York’s Energy Planning board received about 15,000 public comments on its draft state energy plan from July to October, according to a presentation of the comments during Thursday’s board meeting, with commenters expressing a range of views on fossil fuel infrastructure, renewable energy development and nuclear energy.","Good morning and welcome to the weekly Monday edition of the New York & New Jersey Energy newsletter. We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

NJ LOOKS TO COPY NYSERDA MODEL: New Jersey Sen. Andrew Zwicker was at a Climate Week dinner in New York when he met someone from NYSERDA. Now the Middlesex County Democrat is looking at remaking his state’s energy policy landscape in New York’s image, a move that would reduce the power of the state Board of Public Utilities.

“We should let BPU do what it is supposed to do, which is regulate, and then put together another organization solely dedicated to energy policy in New Jersey,” Zwicker told POLITICO in an interview last week.

In the Empire State, that organization is the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the juggernaut of the state’s energy policy and planning. The authority was originally established in 1975 in response to the oil crisis to reduce the state’s reliance on gas. It supports planning efforts, including the work of proposing not-yet-implemented measures to achieve the climate law and facilitating an ongoing state energy plan process.

In the Garden State, the BPU seems to be involved in everything. In recent years, the BPU has been tasked with regulating utilities but also setting, crafting and executing key energy policies. At times, this has put the board in the position of working with economic development officials to promote policies — like offshore wind — at the same time it was tasked with watchdogging the offshore wind companies.

During their affordability-focused gubernatorial campaigns, both Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli showed little love lost for the BPU.

That suggests if Zwicker does introduce legislation, it might not be met with knee-jerk criticism from Republicans and could catch Sherrill’s eye too. Zwicker, who is a scientist at Princeton University’s Plasma Physics Laboratory, was on the Senate select committee formed this year tasked with tackling rising energy costs.

The idea would be that one entity, the new one, has a strong team looking at energy policy, while the BPU focuses on rates.

Where some states delegate procurement of new renewables to utilities, New York relies on NYSERDA to run a centralized process to contract for new onshore wind and solar, offshore wind and storage. The authority has also been tapped to run statewide energy efficiency and heat pump efforts. It oversees programs funded by ratepayers, including through the regional carbon trading program and a $5 billion Clean Energy Fund that’s supported everything from green hydrogen research to building decarbonization competitions. NYSERDA also oversees contracts to pay the upstate nuclear plants to stay online and is responsible for a legacy nuclear site in New York.

Creating a NYSERDA-like entity would still require the BPU to sign off on decisions that affect rates, but could create new ways to do things without having to involve ratepayer dollars, which is generally what the board’s current work is tied to.

“I have mixed feelings about it, I think it could create some new opportunities for financing clean energy,” said BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. — Ry Rivard and Marie J. French

What you may have missed

NEW NUCLEAR BILL — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: A new bill could pave the way for a new nuclear power plant — the first in decades for New Jersey.

The bill, introduced Thursday by Senate Environment and Energy Committee Chair Bob Smith, could put utility customers on the hook to pay for at least part of the construction of enough new nuclear energy to power more than a million homes.

It creates a state-backed incentive program to develop 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear power, according to a draft of the bill obtained by POLITICO. A new nuclear plant could take at least a decade to build.

15,000 PUBLIC COMMENTS: New York’s Energy Planning board received about 15,000 public comments on its draft state energy plan from July to October, according to a presentation of the comments during Thursday’s board meeting, with commenters expressing a range of views on fossil fuel infrastructure, renewable energy development and nuclear energy.

A closer look: Among the roughly 15,000 comments received, 99 percent were from individuals and about 80 percent of individual comments were associated with 13 comment campaigns. The campaigns that drove the most amount of comments were UA Local 798, a union representing pipeline workers, and Smarter NY Energy, a coalition of heating fuel companies that are critical of New York’s 2019 climate law. These two campaigns drove 55 percent of the comments.

Environmental organizations also led comment campaigns, with Sierra Club, New York Renews, Renewable Heat Now, New Yorkers for Clean Power, Food & Water Watch and New York League of Conservation Voters collectively driving 22 percent of the comments.

Many commenters raised concerns about energy affordability — a key issue at the ballot box earlier this month and for the 2026 midterms. But commenters differed in how they think the state should address affordability issues, with some expressing support for fossil fuels and others arguing that renewable energy will help lower bills.

Staffers are updating the draft energy plan to emphasize affordability concerns and “added language that recognizes the need for a diverse mix of energy resources to meet the state’s current and growing electricity demand needs,” said Jessica Waldorf, director of policy implementation at Department of Public Service.

They’re also working on updating the draft’s modeling and scenarios due to federal policy changes, and some commenters expressed concerns about the state’s ability to deploy new solar and battery storage given the federal government’s antipathy to renewable energy. — Mona Zhang

PSC PROTECTS EAP — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: New York’s Public Service Commission ordered electric and gas companies to limit their reliance on federal programs to determine eligibility for the state’s Energy Affordability Program. This ensures delays in federal winter heating assistance for low-income ratepayers won’t also prevent those families from getting help with their bills from the state level program.

HOW TO LOWER BILLS — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: New Jersey could lower residents’ electric bills by $467 a year by 2030, according to a new report by Synapse Energy Economics for the Natural Resources Defense Council and Evergreen Collaborative.

HOCHUL EMBRACES GAS — POLITICO’s Marie J. French and Mona Zhang: Facing a tough reelection battle next year, Gov. Kathy Hochul is steering a monumental pivot on energy policy.

Hochul approved a new gas pipeline championed by President Donald Trump and cut a deal that will keep a gas-fueled cryptocurrency miner running for five more years. The two decisions have sparked outrage from the progressive environmental wing of her party — with three climate-focused groups pointedly endorsing her primary opponent last week.

“She did not just approve a fossil fuel project. She made a moral choice,” Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, who is primarying Hochul, said “New Yorkers deserve a governor who does not treat the climate crisis as a PR problem, but as a test of moral leadership.”

With Trump’s antipathy toward renewables like solar and wind, increasing energy demand and skyrocketing utility bills, moderate Democrats like Hochul are embracing an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy.

ELECTRIFYING BUILDINGS — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: A new report by Switchbox, a nonpartisan think tank focused on state climate policy, found that implementing the all-electric requirement won’t cause grid reliability issues in the short-term and will only have a minor impact on winter demand in the long term.

DELGADO SNAGS ENDORSEMENTS — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: Environmental groups and other left-leaning advocates endorsed Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado’s run for New York governor, days after Gov.

With the United States absent, all eyes were on China.

A crowd had gathered around a glossy Chinese Pavilion, its two upright flags flanking a stage and podium with ceremonial precision. Behind the podium stood a member of China’s delegation, addressing an audience larger than any other at the conference while ticking through images on a screen: Rural streets glowed beneath solar lamps; a smiling driver posed beside a gleaming electric bus; a slide promoted the Vientiane Saysettha Low-Carbon Demonstration Zone, a China-Laos initiative bringing electric transportation and solar power to one of Southeast Asia’s poorest capitals.

In 2024, China accounted for about 40 percent of global electric vehicle exports, and it still controls the overwhelming bulk of solar manufacturing steps. Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told Sierra, “As we [arrived to COP30], in the wee hours of this morning, I drove by a number of Chinese EV manufacturers and dealerships. They are here, they are popular, they're inexpensive.”

Whitehouse chose to attend COP30 in response to the Trump administration’s refusal to send a delegation. “There will be lasting economic damage to the United States from failing to keep up with China in the race to succeed in the clean energy future that is inevitable,” he said. Still, Whitehouse asserted, the Trump administration does not represent the American public on climate issues. “Who they represent is the fossil fuel industry and most importantly, the big fossil fuel donors who have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s political campaign. You are seeing [that influence] in action.”

China invested around $625 billion in clean energy in 2024—a third of the global total—and reached its 2030 renewable-capacity target six years early. Abroad, its state banks and construction firms have financed or built solar mini-grids, EV fleets, and battery plants across dozens of developing countries, sometimes within months. That speed contrasts sharply with Western or multilateral projects that can take years to clear approvals. Beijing presents its global finance as South-South cooperation—a way of collaborating with countries in the Global South to pool resources and strategies through aid and other initiatives.

But for all the promotion of itself as a green leader, China remains one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, responsible for roughly a third of global fossil CO₂ in 2024 (though its emissions have peaked in the last 18 months, according to Carbon Brief), and its reliance on coal-fired power has continued to surge, offsetting emissions reductions gains. President Xi Jinping’s “no new coal abroad” pledge has produced real, if uneven, results since he introduced it four years ago. China has canceled enough projects to book a reduction of 6.1 billion metric tons of CO₂ emissions, more than the United States’ total annual emissions in 2024,, though operation coal projects funded by China have grown in capacity by 4.1GW.

“There is no doubt that China has driven down the cost of renewables, which everyone is benefiting from—and that’s a huge plus to the world overall,” said Jonathan Beynon, senior policy associate on climate finance at the Center for Global Development. “But it is not providing as much climate finance as it should, and a lot of what it does provide is on very nonconcessional terms, which is a major problem.”

“I get the impression that China is willing and able to step up and is looking to fill the gaps left by others,” he added, an indirect nod to the vacuum in the market left by the US.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-17 14:03:01.796678

They’re made as part of a preproduction process at several facilities around the state and often end up escaping the factories that produce them, entering the environment. That puts more plastic in Texas waterways and in the animals that inhabit or depend them.

Recently, almost a dozen organizations – some of them activists, and others representing Gulf Coast tourism and fishing industries – have written a letter to Gov. Greg Abbot asking for his help on the matter. This time, it’s not just about the pollution; their appeal emphasizes the monetary impact Nurdles could have if the contamination continues.

Chris Gray is the Gulf Coast Reporter for Chron.com. He sat down with the Standard to talk about nurdles, where they come from, and what activists say could happen if they continue to proliferate. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This interview has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So first off, tell us, how are all these nurdles getting into the water and onto Texas beaches?

Chris Gray: Well, they come from about three dozen facilities – three of which are on Galveston Bay, which is sort of how the story came to my attention – but they really are all over Texas, and have even apparently started washing up on Mexican beaches as well.

What happens is they get into the wastewater as they’re being created. And these plastic pellets, later used to make more refined plastic products like bottles and such, they get into the water if they fall off of trucks and trains, and then they wind up on the beaches.

Apparently one organization, the Turtle Island Restoration Network, has collected over 16,000 [pellets] just doing their own beach patrols with their volunteers.

You mentioned in your article that these beads have been troubling environmentalists for years. How long has this been a problem for Texas?

Plastic pollution has been around for decades. I don’t know if it’s become this acute until the last few years, maybe.

I guess it just depends on how carefully these plants are watching, how they’re getting rid of these nurdles and how they’re loading them onto their transportation methods.

Now, you’ve reported that nearly a dozen groups have written a letter to the governor asking for his help with the nurdle issue. Tell us a little bit about what their appeal is.

What has really changed about the conversation around this thing is that these tourism officials are now recognizing that it’s just bad for business to have all these plastic pellets washing up on the beach and come to the media’s attention, and reflecting negatively on what it’s like down here. It could potentially turn people away from wanting to come visit down here.

Yeah, so environmental and economic. What if the issue goes unresolved? How much damage could nurdles do?

You talked about tourism, but what about the fisheries, the animals that ingest them, beach health and water health? Tell us a little bit about that.

I mean, these little pellets can really wreak havoc in the food chain down here. They’ll get into the fish, and then into people who eat the fish.

It also can hinder growth in fish and their ability to reproduce, which in turn would have a negative impact on both the commercial and recreational fishing industries.

Any sense on the dollar value that is being lost, or could be lost, as this problem goes unresolved?

The numbers that I’ve seen show that the outdoor recreation industry in Texas – which I guess is fishing and that sort of thing, but also coming to the beach – supports 300,000 jobs, is responsible for $14 billion in salaries, and $31 billion in added value to the state’s economy.

I don’t think, at least not that I’ve seen, that anyone has tracked how much has actually been lost, or is being lost from plastic pollution, but if you take that as kind of the high-water mark, just imagine how much could be affected if it’s not curbed somehow.

Yes, that’s a lot of money at stake. Well, finally, is the governor, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or any other state agency likely to step in?

I have not seen any kind of response from the governor’s office to this letter. I believe the TCEQ is supposed to publish an updated surface water quality standards sometime next year.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Nurdles_01_gentlemanrook-1024x748.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:27.297893

But what does the artificial intelligence push mean for the rest of the country?

On Friday, Gov. Greg Abbott and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced plans for the centers, which will power AI and cloud operations nationwide. The facilities are expected to create hundreds of jobs and shift critical infrastructure away from Silicon Valley.

“Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy,” Abbott said in a statement. “We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen.”

Google is not alone. The announcement follows news that Anthropic, the startup behind Claude AI, plans to invest $50 billion in data centers in New York and Texas, with operations going online next year.

AI could spike electric costs: Analysts

Analysts warn AI could significantly raise electricity costs. Americans are already seeing higher bills as data centers become a growing strain on the power grid.

The Department of Energy predicts AI could double nationwide electricity demand by 2030, and Texas is now the testing ground.

ERCOT, the state’s grid operator, has the authority to cut power to large users if supply runs low.

Google says it will add solar panels and battery storage to ease grid stress, but experts caution this is just the beginning of a national challenge over energy and AI.

“The question is who pays for all of that infrastructure, those grid upgrades,” said Benjamin Lee, an engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “There is a risk that the data center operators are benefiting disproportionately from those energy investments, but then those costs are being distributed to the local ratepayers, the local consumers in those communities.”

Ecology’s latest greenhouse gas inventory covers 2021. Without fresher information, the public can’t judge whether cap-and-trade taxes are reducing emissions, said Rep. Mary Dye, R-Pomeroy.

“It is a terribly heavy burden for the productive people of the state, and we deserve to know whether that sacrifice is making a difference,” she said.

Dye filed the lawsuit in Thurston County Superior Court with Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, and Washington Policy Center vice president for research Todd Myers. The Citizen Action Defense Fund, a nonprofit law firm, represents the three.

Washington law requires Ecology to issue a report every two years on the state’s carbon footprint. The lawsuit claims the department has fallen inexcusably behind. The department doesn’t expect to report emissions for 2022 and 2023 until early 2026.

Meanwhile, cap-and-trade has raised almost $3.5 billion for carbon-reduction programs in less than three years. The tax raises the price of electricity, natural gas and liquid fuels.

An up-to-date greenhouse gas inventory would help legislators use the money wisely, Dye said.

“I have to have the information because without it I can’t evaluate the policies that come to us,” she said. “Ecology needs to be transparent to gain the trust of the Washingtonians who are paying the money.”

Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said the lawsuit was “an example of an ongoing misinformation campaign meant to undermine climate policy.”

“Measuring greenhouse gas emissions from every source in the state is a complex undertaking, and it takes time,” Sixkiller said in a statement.

Ecology reported early this year that the state’s carbon output in 2021 was 96.1 million metric tons. By law, Washington’s carbon footprint by 2030 must be only 50 million metric tons.

Ecology said future reports will show the impacts of cap-and-trade, the low-carbon fuel standard, electric-vehicle mandate and new building codes.

“They should be curious about whether their policies are working,” Myers said. “If you really cared, nobody should have to beat you with a stick.”

The Environmental Protection Agency provides most of the data that Ecology needs. The EPA released emissions data for 2022 in April 2024.

Washington’s emissions in 2022 rose slightly from the year before, according to the EPA. Ecology has said it needs time to evaluate the EPA’s data.

EPA released preliminary national data for 2023 early this year. The EPA has not provided state-level data.

“We’re building our own state-level inventory so we can rely on accurate, transparent data to guide smart decisions and track our progress,” Sixkiller said.

Myers filed a similar lawsuit this year, but a judge ruled he lacked standing to bring the suit. He said he hopes adding two legislators as plaintiffs will bolster the case.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/Mary-Dye-Photo-2025-11-21-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 12:01:48.861277

Just a year ago, the transition from fossil-fueled to electrified transportation and buildings was well-funded by the federal government. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) had provided tax credits and other programs that would make nearly $400 billion available for electric vehicles and $28 billion for building improvements like heat pumps over ten years, based on estimates from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That’s gone now.

States that remain committed to addressing climate change are deciding how to respond. Choices include backfilling federal spending or backing off of their climate ambitions. In late 2024, California’s Governor Gavin Newsom initially said the state would replace lost federal funding for electric vehicles, but then he reversed course. Many states are facing fiscal challenges and have balanced budget obligations that make backfilling federal funding unrealistic. Summing up the challenge, during a recent Politico interview about the loss of federal electric vehicle tax credits, incoming California Senate leader Monique Limón said the state needs to “find the middle ground between desire and capacity.”

There’s a Hole in the Clean Energy Budget

Much of the funding provided through the IRA was in the form of tax credits claimed by individual taxpayers, so the lost federal funding that would have flowed into California can only be estimated. Assuming that the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates were spread evenly over ten years and that California’s share would have been proportionate to the state’s population, the annual lost funding is likely in the single digit billions of dollars for electric vehicles and in the hundreds of millions for building electrification. These are big numbers, even in the context of California’s sizable $300+ billion state budget.

Traditionally, California, and many other states, have funded clean energy programs through charges on consumers’ utility bills – a popular “off budget” funding source. The state’s large program to subsidize the installation of heat pumps for space and water heating is largely funded through this approach. However, many Californians are pushing back against what they say they are experiencing as excessively high electricity rates. Large electric bills are especially hitting the pockets of lower income households and are making electric vehicles and buildings less attractive. Backfilling the loss of federal funding through electricity prices is obviously a bad idea since the recovery of that funding through higher rates hurts all households and undermines widespread electrification.

Cap-and-Trade Offs

During a period of tight budgets, the revenues generated through California’s cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases stand out as the most viable “on-budget” source of funding to encourage electrification. The program, which was just extended to 2045, includes quarterly auctions of carbon permits in which entities that emit greenhouse gases purchase permits to offset their pollution. This makes it more expensive to pollute and creates an incentive to reduce pollution. The auctions also generate revenues that the state can distribute or spend. The first, eagerly awaited, auction since cap-and-trade was extended is later this week.

In a blog post last week Severin Borenstein discussed the 37% of proceeds from those auctions that are refunded directly to customers via utility bills. The remaining proceeds, referred to as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), are appropriated by the Legislature and Governor. In the flurry of bills adopted in October, the legislature set new spending priorities. Two bills on this subject create a prioritized list of what the auction proceeds will be spent on, most of which have little to do with clean energy. Electrification programs are not on the list of precommitted spending areas, but could still receive spending in two specified ways.

First, if auction proceeds exceed the committed amount, additional funding is intended to go to areas including clean transportation. There is a second possible source of funds if the California Air Resources Board (the program administrator) ends up selling permits to keep prices from rising too high. Any proceeds from those particular permits are intended to go toward building electrification (see blog posts from James Bushnell for more on how this price ceiling process works).

Allocating Proceeds Will Be a Charged Issue

I am pleased to see that the Legislature plans to put some thought into how money should be spent in the priority areas. A commitment to developing multiyear spending plans is written into the bills. State money for clean energy is especially precious at this time and the state faces tough choices. For electrification in particular, foremost in my mind is the choice between spending money on programs and returning money directly to consumers by lowering rates.

The arguments for using revenues to reduce electricity rates are strong. In a 2022 paper, Severin Borenstein, Meredith Fowlie and James Sallee estimated that the already excessively high electricity rates in 2019 were equivalent to a $600 annual tax on driving an electric vehicle. Taking the present value of the annual tax over 15 years amounts to $6,500. The “tax” is surely much higher in 2025 given continued rate escalation. In other words, reducing volumetric electricity rates to a level that reflects the economic costs of using energy would essentially fully backfill for the lost federal subsidies. Unfortunately that level of rate reduction is beyond the reach of the revenues that will be available through the GGRF. Still, the point is that, directionally, rate reductions are a widely available incentive to electrify transportation and buildings.

Spending programs to encourage electrification could also have a place, but I believe the bar on what programs merit funding should be set high. Policymakers should ask questions like: What market failure is the spending addressing? How will the program be rigorously evaluated and improved or eliminated if ineffective or no longer needed? Energy Institute researchers have evaluated numerous energy programs in the past using rigorous methods like randomized controlled trials and machine learning, and the results have often been far worse than hoped.

The loss of federal funding for clean energy puts legislators and governors in a difficult place. States will need to think hard about how to balance clean energy spending with other priorities and carefully assess how to best use the limited resources still available for clean energy.

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), today announced 26 additional locations will receive grant awards totaling $14 million in federal funding to build electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Wisconsin. Supported through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program under former President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these fast-charging stations will help ensure residents and visitors alike have access to the charging infrastructure needed to travel from point A to point B in Wisconsin.

This announcement comes as, earlier this year, Gov. Evers announced Wisconsin would be joining a multi-state lawsuit to stop the Trump Administration from blocking over $60 million in NEVI Formula Program funding Wisconsin expected to receive to support electric vehicle infrastructure projects across the state. The lawsuit came after Gov. Evers spent months urging the Trump Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to release and stop obstructing funding that Wisconsin was promised to expand access to electric vehicle infrastructure across the state and prevent any delays in federal funding to support improving Wisconsin infrastructure. Thanks to these efforts, in June, a federal judge blocked the Trump Administration’s action, allowing several EV infrastructure projects utilizing NEVI funding to move forward in Wisconsin. However, federal threats to the future of this impactful program remain.

“My administration and I have prioritized ensuring our state’s infrastructure meets the needs of the 21st Century since Day One because expanding our clean energy and electric vehicle infrastructure helps create jobs and bolster our economy, and it’s good for our planet, too,” said Gov. Evers. “Thanks to our actions to get the Trump Administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve.”

This latest round of awards fills coverage gaps after the first round of awards was announced in May 2024. The first round awarded $22.4 million in federal funding for 52 projects, 11 of which are currently operational and 16 have been authorized for construction. Through the first two rounds of awards, WisDOT has awarded more than $36.4 million for a total of 78 projects. The governor celebrated the launch of the first of these charging stations in Wisconsin at Kwik Trip stores in Ashland, Menomonie, and Chippewa Falls earlier this year.

“As transportation choices continue to evolve, we’re seeing a growing interest in electric vehicles, with more than 37,000 EVs registered in Wisconsin,” said WisDOT Secretary Kristina Boardman. “WisDOT is pleased to help offer drivers reliable and convenient places to stop, so they can feel comfortable making a trip across the state and have the opportunity to support local businesses along the way.”

The charging stations will be built along Wisconsin’s Alternative Fuel Corridor, reaching all corners of the state to support the more than 37,000 EVs registered in the state, as well as travelers and visitors. Site locations include fuel convenience stores, restaurants, lodging, and retail/grocery stores.

WisDOT evaluated a variety of factors when choosing these projects, including location, the potential for future development, availability of pull-through parking spaces to allow for larger EVs, and extended business site hours to accommodate longer refueling times. A full list of the 26 awarded locations can be found here. The locations of every planned charging station can be found on WisDOT’s EV charging station dashboard.

Today’s announcement also builds on the Evers Administration’s previous efforts to build a strong clean energy economy, including establishing the Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change and prioritizing supporting hybrid-electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and related infrastructure as a key climate pollution reduction recommendation in the Task Force final report, as well as releasing the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan, which recommends accelerating the development of Wisconsin’s EV and EV charging station equipment manufacturing and supporting the transition to EVs statewide. According to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, Wisconsin has the potential to emerge as a worldwide player in the manufacturing of EVs and related equipment and ranks higher than the national average in key EV job categories, including electrical engineers, industrial engineers, and computer programmers.

During the press conference, 16 groups presented Attorney General Tong with a letter celebrating his work fighting the Trump Administration's attacks on the offshore industry.

“The Port of New London is evidence of the economic impact of this new American industry that is the offshore wind energy supply chain,” said New London Mayor Michael Passero. “State Pier, a long-neglected, underutilized state asset, was transformed into a premier East Coast marine terminal thanks to the offshore wind industry. Union workers rebuilt the facility, with local contractors from southeastern Connecticut also participating. The Connecticut Port Authority now earns more revenue than ever before from the shipping of offshore wind turbine components to and from State Pier. All of these direct benefits have led to indirect benefits for subcontractors and small businesses across the region.”

“Harnessing the breeze off the Atlantic coast is the key to powering our homes, bettering our local economies, and improving public health for all here in Connecticut,” said Samantha Dynowski, Sierra Club Connecticut Chapter Director. “New London is among the first Connecticut towns to so clearly experience the benefits of offshore wind development. Because of the hard work nearly completed here, 350,000 homes will receive clean power. Offshore wind is our state’s offramp, making Connectiut less dependent on costly fossil fuel projects that raise our energy bills. As Revolution Wind nears the finish line, we will continue to champion the project and look forward to when its clean power and cost savings reaches homes.”

“It’s fitting that we are holding this event in the middle of the latest COP meeting on Climate Change. Those who take science seriously understand that climate change is the single greatest challenge we face today, with devastating consequences for us if we fail to meet that challenge,” said Charles Rothenberger, Director of Government Relations for Save the Sound. “At the same time, we need to improve the resilience and reliability of our electric grid while also addressing the rising energy costs that households are facing. Offshore Wind is the perfect solution to all of these problems. It is the single largest source of zero-carbon domestic energy available to New England in the near term, its generation profile is ideally suited to address winter reliability concerns, and multiple analyses have shown its potential to save ratepayers money by lowering wholesale energy prices and insulating customers from the impacts of natural gas price volatility.”

""Connecticut has already laid the groundwork for being a leader in offshore wind.

Taiwan has secured the approval for a 180 MW floating wind project

Taiwan has long been living in the shadow of China, with the nation constantly under threat of a full-scale invasion by Beijing. The geopolitical issues have not dampened the nation’s ambitions for clean and renewable energy production, as Netherlands-based IX Renewables is set to commission a new 180 MW floating wind project in Taiwanese waters.

The Rui Li 1 floating wind facility will lean on the substantial expertise of its stakeholders as Taiwan aims to increase renewable energy capacity over the next few years. The myriad of interested parties came together at the recent Energy Taiwan 2025 renewable energy and net-zero trade show, and agreed on terms to advance the project beyond the planning phase towards actual, on-the-ground commissioning.

Asia’s renewable energy market has grown exponentially over the past decade

The news that Taiwan is planning to expand its renewable energy capacity is not a singular stance, with other Asian nations also boasting substantial investments in solar and wind power projects. China produces the vast majority of the world’s solar panels, and India has a foothold in the sector as well. With the loss of Russian energy resources due to the new wave of sanctions, the renewable energy sector is perfectly positioned to become a force in the international energy market.

Asia Cement Corporation has jumped on board the Rui Li 1 project

Asia Cement Corporation has agreed to serve as a sponsor for the planned 180 MW floating Rui Li 1 wind project. Dutch company IX Renewables is the major stakeholder, with Japan’s GF Corporation, Hexicon, and SNOW BV playing essential roles as well. Asia Cement has agreed to serve as the principal sponsor for the project, leveraging its vast construction expertise.

“By combining Taiwan’s strong industrial foundation with IX’s international offshore wind experience, we can jointly bring floating wind technology from vision to reality.” – Eric Kamphues, CEO of IX Renewables

The Rui Li 1 project will be located off the coast of Hsinchu County at water depths of 70–95m, and will feature 12 turbines spinning at maximum speed to increase renewable energy production for Taiwan. The expectation is for the wind farm to generate roughly 833GWh of electricity annually, which is enough juice to power 205,000 households.

The first funding opportunity provides up to $275 million for American industrial facilities capable of producing valuable minerals from existing industrial and coal byproducts. The second provides up to $80 million to establish Mine of the Future proving grounds for real-world testing of next-generation mining technologies.

The Department announced in August its intent to invest $1 billion to advance and scale mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies, delivering on President Trump’s Executive Orders, Unleashing American Energy and Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production. These actions will secure America’s critical material supply chain, increase domestic mineral production, reduce reliance on foreign sources, and strengthen U.S. energy independence.

“For too long, the United States has relied on foreign nations for the minerals and materials that power our economy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “We have these resources here at home, but years of complacency ceded America’s mining and industrial base to other nations. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are reversing that trend, rebuilding America’s ability to mine, process, and manufacture the materials essential to our energy and economic security.”

“The Mine of the Future - Proving Ground Initiative will be among the Department of Energy’s first major investments into mining technology research and development in almost four decades,” said U.S. Department of Energy Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy Kyle Haustveit. “This effort will help establish the United States as the world’s leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals—creating economic prosperity in fossil energy communities across the country while strengthening critical mineral supply chains for the United States and its allies.”

Mines & Metals Capacity Expansion – Piloting By-Product Critical Minerals and Materials Recovery at Domestic Industrial Facilities

FE announced up to $275 million under the Mines & Metals Capacity Expansion notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) to address the potential for America’s industries to recover valuable critical materials by piloting promising future separation and recovery technologies directly at industrial sites.

This NOFO includes two focus areas for the design, construction, and operation of large pilot-scale facilities to produce critical materials:

Coal-based feedstocks – advancing and accelerating demonstration of critical material production using coal-based resources as feedstocks.

Industrial byproducts and wastes – open to all U.S. industry sectors that produce market-ready materials where industrial byproducts and/or wastes can be a source of crucially needed critical materials.

These pilots will demonstrate the feasibility of recovering critical minerals from existing American infrastructure and industrial activity, reducing waste while building new domestic supply chains for high-value materials. Read the complete NOFO here.

Mine of the Future – Proving Ground Initiative

FE also announced up to $80 million under the Mine of the Future – Proving Ground Initiative NOFO, which supports DOE’s broader Mine of the Future initiative to accelerate technology commercialization and increase the competitiveness of domestic mining operations.

Field sites are essential for minerals and mining stakeholders to test innovative technologies under real-world conditions. Awards made under this NOFO will not only develop mining proving grounds but also support R&D projects that accelerate technologies past laboratory and/or bench scale to testing and demonstration in a field-scale setting, an essential step to de-risk commercial adoption of these new mining technologies.

Projects selected under this initiative will also create opportunities for hands-on workforce training to prepare the next generation of American miners and engineers to operate advanced mining systems safely and efficiently.

Many companies fall within the reach of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule solely due to their import of items that may contain PFAS during the reporting period.
Recognizing these challenges, EPA has proposed several new exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule aimed at providing relief to entities that are least likely to have relevant information.
EPA also proposes a broad de minimis exemption for mixtures or articles with PFAS concentrations under 0.1%.
Comments on the proposed rule are due by December 29, 2025.","As the longest federal government shutdown on record continued earlier this week, EPA stayed busy putting the finishing touches on one of its PFAS-related priorities — enabling EPA to “smartly collect” information about PFAS substances under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as required by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Early signs of EPA’s desire to simplify the TSCA PFAS reporting rule, which was finalized by the Biden EPA in 2023, were evident in the agency’s April 2025 announcement of “Major Actions to Combat PFAS Contamination” discussed here, where EPA committed to implement the required information collection “without overburdening small businesses and article importers.”

Earlier this week, EPA announced and then promptly published in the Federal Register its proposal to deliver on that promise. If finalized, the rule would significantly rein in what many see as an overly broad TSCA PFAS reporting scheme. This scheme requires manufacturers of certain PFAS, including importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing articles, to submit a one-time report to EPA regarding these manufacturing and importing activities over an 11-year window stretching from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2022. Due to both the long lookback period and the breadth of activities covered by the rule, the reporting scheme has presented a host of challenges for regulated entities, many of whom have expended significant resources simply to determine whether they are subject to the rule, and if so, what information they should report.

Many companies fall within the reach of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule solely due to their import of items that may contain PFAS during the reporting period. Given the ubiquitous presence of PFAS in hundreds of kinds of ordinary articles, many companies that import everyday items like electronic devices, cables, or gaskets have had to engage in significant due diligence to assess their reporting obligations. This is particularly true given the long lookback period, which left some companies sifting through vintage records to determine whether they even possess the necessary information. In many cases, document retention policies do not require companies to keep records that old, and in cases of mergers, acquisitions, or other corporate changes, determining which entity has the records and which entities must report is no simple task.

Recognizing these challenges, EPA has proposed several new exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule aimed at providing relief to entities that are least likely to have relevant information. The most impactful of these proposed exemptions is probably the exemption for article importers. In the economic analysis supporting the 2023 rule, EPA estimated that of the universe of article importers who have or will conduct due diligence to identify reportable PFAS, only 10% would determine that they possess reportable information. The remaining 90% would be burdened by compliance determination activities only to determine that they do not need to report because they either do not possess or cannot reasonably ascertain the information. Of course, with the proposed exemptions coming exactly two years after the reporting rule became effective, many companies have already expended significant resources on the very effort the proposal is designed to alleviate.

EPA also proposes a broad de minimis exemption for mixtures or articles with PFAS concentrations under 0.1%. This low-concentration exemption would apply regardless of total production volume of the mixture or article. This exemption, along with the article importer exemption, is likely to remove the reporting obligation for a large swath of entities if finalized as proposed. Other proposed but less widely applicable exemptions cover PFAS byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates, as well as PFAS manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development purposes.

For entities that will still have a reporting obligation despite the new exemptions, EPA has proposed a new reporting window: the reporting portal will open 60 days after the proposed rule is finalized and entities will have three months to report. This time frame is shorter than the original rule’s reporting window of six months, which is currently slated to begin on April 13, 2026, and end October 13, 2026. Given how much time has passed since the rule was originally promulgated, EPA believes that companies have had adequate time to consider their reporting obligations and three months should be sufficient.

“We organized the program around four big thrusts we’ve advanced for years,” said Philip Bedient, director of the SSPEED Center and the Herman and George R. Brown Professor of Engineering at Rice.
Nature-based flood solutions followed, featuring Dutch and Rice experts on green infrastructure that slows, stores and soaks stormwater across neighborhoods, counties and watersheds.
“To have a big conference and not address the Guadalupe flood would be a mistake,” Bedient said.
“The second day was about market-based natural carbon solutions,” said Chris Ordoñez, program manager for nature-based solutions at the SSPEED Center.","Rice University’s Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center convened more than 100 experts, industry leaders and attendees Nov. 6-7 for its 12th annual conference, connecting cutting-edge flood mitigation with the fast-emerging world of market-based natural carbon solutions.

Hosted at Rice’s Anderson-Clarke Center, the meeting was deliberately split into two distinct but deeply linked days. The first day of the conference focused on major infrastructure, nature-based flood strategies and real-time lessons from this summer’s devastating Hill Country flood. The following day’s topics turned to natural climate solutions and the carbon market, tools that can channel private capital into land stewardship, coastal protection and methane abatement while reinforcing long-term flood resilience.

“We organized the program around four big thrusts we’ve advanced for years,” said Philip Bedient, director of the SSPEED Center and the Herman and George R. Brown Professor of Engineering at Rice. “Galveston Bay Park Plan, nature-based solutions, Harris County’s MaapNext floodplain modeling and hard-won lessons from the Hill Country flood — getting all of that into one day is ambitious, but it’s exactly these conversations Houston and Texas need.”

The conference opened with updates on the Galveston Bay Park Plan, a regional surge and flood-mitigation concept SSPEED has refined since 2016 with architects, engineers and public partners. Sessions led by Rogers Partners, Jim Blackburn and Rice engineer Avantika Gori charted how design, advanced modeling and governance are converging as the region invests in layered coastal protection.

Nature-based flood solutions followed, featuring Dutch and Rice experts on green infrastructure that slows, stores and soaks stormwater across neighborhoods, counties and watersheds.

“What used to be called ‘low-impact development’ has matured into nature-based solutions, and we’ve become leaders in the field — working with researchers, students and practitioners to actually build these systems,” said Blackburn, professor in the practice of environmental law at Rice and co-director of the SSPEED Center.

A highlight was Harris County Flood Control District’s preview of MaapNext (Modeling, Assessment and Awareness Project), a next-generation, countywide 2D floodplain modeling effort expected to change how risk is mapped and mitigated.

“Bringing Harris County leadership to campus to discuss MaapNext matters,” Bedient said. “These are the people who can implement change in one of the most flood-prone cities in the United States.”

Recognizing the urgency of extreme rainfall beyond Houston, the program also examined the July 4 Hill Country flood, which struck the Guadalupe River Basin with astonishing speed and intensity. University of Texas at Arlington’s Nick Fang and Jacob Torres shared advances in flood warning and monitoring, while a poster session convened the teams running the region’s flood-warning system.

“To have a big conference and not address the Guadalupe flood would be a mistake,” Bedient said. “We’re tackling it head-on to accelerate practical improvements.”

Equally important, the first day threaded engineering with social science and community partnership. Rice scholars Jim Elliott and Dominic Boyer discussed the university’s new Creative Ventures-supported outreach with residents affected in the basin.

“If you don’t have buy-in from communities, you’re wasting your time,” Bedient said. “We’re blending engineering with social impact because implementation is where resilience succeeds or fails.”

Bedient also pointed to collaborations seeded during the meeting: “We’ve got the city of Houston, Harris County, the Port of Houston and state partners here — people who can take research and turn it into projects. There are real opportunities with UT-Arlington, and we’re building new ties with Texas Tech’s meteorology group to pair advanced weather analysis with our hydrology and infrastructure work.”

The conference’s second day showcased how natural systems can store carbon and strengthen resilience with sessions spanning soil carbon on working lands, forest carbon, coastal “blue carbon” and methane abatement via orphan-well plugging. It also traced how carbon markets and registries, like BCarbon, incubated in collaboration with Rice and its Baker Institute for Public Policy, help landowners, companies and communities monetize stewardship.

“The second day was about market-based natural carbon solutions,” said Chris Ordoñez, program manager for nature-based solutions at the SSPEED Center. “We brought together the market architects, the scientists and the project developers in one intimate space to learn from each other and form long-term partnerships.”

Ordoñez emphasized the scientific backbone of the agenda: “Soils are tremendous carbon stores — native grasses pull carbon from the air and move it into the ground for durable storage. Our biochar keynote with Rice’s Carrie Masiello highlighted a fast-growing approach that locks carbon into a stable form while improving soil health and water retention. It’s one of those win-wins where you can store carbon and support sustainable agriculture.”

Beyond Texas, SSPEED and partners discussed work in Tamaulipas, Mexico, where teams are helping develop protocols for nature-based credits and piloting on-the-ground projects. Sessions also examined the methane market and practical steps to plug abandoned and orphaned wells, actions that generate credits while delivering immediate climate and public-safety benefits.

Amid skepticism about climate solutions, Ordoñez voiced reasons for resolve. “There’s plenty of pessimism out there, but Earth already gives us the best tools we have right now,” he said. “We won’t meet our climate goals without carbon removal, and nature is our most readily deployable pathway today.”

Houston’s long history with hurricanes and extreme rainfall has taught a clear lesson: Resilience is not one project or one agency but rather a portfolio that blends engineered protection, watershed wide green infrastructure, community partnership and policy and market mechanisms that mobilize investment at scale. In that sense, the conference functioned less as a symposium than a launchpad to align infrastructure, ecology and economics to help communities thrive in a wetter, warmer century.",https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/2025-11/featured_sspeed.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:02:31.731598

A filing published on Nov. 13 by the Shaanxi Administration for Market Regulation shows the company will obtain about 62% (61.9998%) of PotisEdge’s voting rights through a mix of equity purchase, capital injection and voting-rights entrustment. The acquisition gives LONGi a ready-built foothold in energy storage at a moment when the solar PV sector faces collapsing prices and industry-wide losses.

The transaction follows a period of rapid momentum for PotisEdge. Just weeks before the filing, the Suzhou-based firm signed a strategic agreement with Australia’s Club Solar to deploy 2 GWh of residential storage systems, underscoring its strength in overseas markets.

LONGi, which dominates the supply of silicon wafers and modules, has had relatively limited exposure to storage. But after seven consecutive loss-making quarters and a 2024 net loss of CNY 8.6 billion, the company is under pressure to build a second growth engine after its hydrogen venture stalled amid slow commercialisation.

PotisEdge, founded in 2015, has built full-stack R&D capabilities across five core system technologies – integrated Centralized Cell Safety Monitoring/Management System (iCCS), BMS, PCS, EMS and TMS – and has filed nearly 350 patents. It ranks second globally among DC-side storage-system integrators and top six in China’s commercial and industrial segment. Its 31GWh of global capacity and more than 10GWh of grid-connected systems place it among the most internationally active Chinese storage firms.

Its rapid financing history — attracting more than 30 strategic investors, including CRRC Capital, GoodWe and Maxwell — made it one of the highest-valued independent integrators in China’s storage sector.

LONGi’s move makes it the last of China’s top module manufacturers — alongside Trina Solar, JinkoSolar, JA Solar and Canadian Solar — to formally enter the storage business. But the timing aligns with surging sector economics. China’s storage industry generated CNY 493.1bn in the first three quarters of 2025, with profit up 38% year-on-year, far outpacing revenue growth.

The challenges remain significant. LONGi will need to integrate PotisEdge’s technology and overseas channels effectively to differentiate itself and compete with battery giants like CATL and BYD.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday approved NRG Energy’s plan to buy 12.9 GW in gas-fired power plants, and a demand response company from LS Power in a roughly $12 billion deal, saying it wouldn’t hurt market competition.

FERC rejected calls by the PJM Interconnection’s market monitor to impose conditions on NRG designed to prevent it from exerting market power in PJM’s energy and capacity markets. Monitoring Analytics failed to show that NRG would be able to influence market prices after the deal is completed, FERC said.

Under the deal, NRG’s capacity in PJM would jump to 9.5 GW from 2.1 GW and NRG would own 2.2 GW in New York, up from 1.2 GW, according to the companies’ application at FERC. The Houston-based independent power producer will also acquire CPower, a commercial and industrial virtual power plant platform with 6 GW of capacity under contract, including about 4 GW in PJM, according to an investor presentation.

Once complete, the deal would roughly double NRG’s generating fleet. Besides the assets in PJM and New York, the transaction includes three power plants in Texas totaling nearly 2,060 MW and two power plants in New England totaling 940 MW.

NRG contends the U.S. power markets are in an “unprecedented supercycle,” after about 15 years of little demand growth. At the same time, new gas-fired generation generally cannot come online until the 2030s, partly due to supply chain and labor constraints as well as regulatory bottlenecks, according to the company.

NRG and LS Power expect to close the deal early next year. The transaction must be approved by the New York State Public Service Commission. As part of the deal, LS Power will receive about 11% of NRG’s outstanding stock and $6.4 billion in cash. NRG will assume about $3.2 billion in debt from LS Power.

Separately, FERC on Friday approved LS Power’s planned purchase of BP Wind Energy North America’s 1.3-GW wind fleet in seven states. Power from the wind farms is under contract to more than 15 offtakers, according to the companies.

The wind farms are in Indiana, Kansas, South Dakota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Hawaii and Idaho.

They are thus willing to deliberately lose the climate change technology race rather than adopt measures to catch up. They would rather concede than admit that America has been outperformed.

China’s dominance in clean energy manufacturing is quantifiable and accelerating. According to multiple sources, China now controls over 70% of global manufacturing capacity related to renewables. Last year, China installed nearly nine times the US total of new renewable energy capacity. In the first half of 2025, it added more solar panels than the rest of the world combined. Clean energy now contributes 10% to China’s GDP. Innovations like five-minute electric vehicle (EV) charging and massive solar farms, such as the Tibetan Plateau complex, position Beijing to capture 70% of global clean technology exports by 2030.

Moreover, China’s EV industry has surged to global preeminence, commanding over 60% of worldwide sales and reshaping the automotive landscape through unmatched scale, affordability, and innovation. This dominance stems from battery supremacy by firms like CATL, BYD, and CALB, which leaves US and European competitors struggling to compete.

President Donald Trump routinely calls climate change a “hoax” benefiting China, emphasizing the need for oil and gas development, where the United States is the top producer and exporter.

“They don’t see climate change as a problem,” George David Banks, who ran Trump’s first-term climate portfolio, told Politico. He added: “They don’t want to essentially create a jobs program for China.”

Policies reflect this: The One Big, Beautiful Bill, signed July 4, 2025, repealed key Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. Trump executive orders banned new federal wind leasing and paused EV incentives, temporarily halting the nearly complete Revolution Wind farm off Rhode Island, citing unspecified national security interests.

Critics highlight the stakes. US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, attending COP30 unofficially as the administration boycotted it, spotted Chinese EV dealerships upon arrival and warned: “It actually really hurts us economically to be missing out on the clean energy transition and to be missing out on global leadership.”

Even many analysts who are not deeply concerned with the development of renewables note that US grid strains stemming from the rising demands of Artificial Intelligence data centers argue for rapid buildouts of all energy resources.

Globally, even traditional fossil fuel powers are embracing the transition to renewable energy. Saudi Arabia, for example, is eyeing 50% renewables by 2030.

While many nations have adopted slow and unambitious renewable energy plans, no other government matches the Trump administration’s wholesale assault on the solar and wind power industries, which is based in part on superpower rivalry.

Hornbach, Reber Logistik, Teva Germany (with its brand ratiopharm), Rhenus, and DHL Supply Chain will each successively deploy a Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck on their regular logistics routes within Germany. The goal is not only to test use cases across various industries and capture additional operating scenarios, but also to ensure that all findings feed directly into further vehicle development as well as preparations for sales and service processes.

All five fuel-cell trucks will be deployed by the partners over a period of one year on different routes under real operating conditions in various logistics applications — from temperature-controlled pharmaceutical transport to general cargo transport in international long-distance transport.

As a fuel-cell truck with a gross vehicle weight of around 40 tons and a payload of approximately 25 tons, the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck offers technical specifications on par with modern diesel long-haul trucks. Its fuel-cell system delivers a continuous output of up to 300 kW, supported by a small buffer battery to provide situational power support during peak loads and to recover energy during braking.

The truck uses liquid hydrogen as the energy source, which offers significant advantages over gaseous hydrogen: higher energy density enables greater range per tank fill and reduced transport requirements – both enhancing economic efficiency and sustainability of operations. Refueling takes place at dedicated liquid hydrogen (sLH2) stations in Woerth am Rhein and the Duisburg area.

In the initial trial phase, the five fuel-cell trucks covered more than 225,000 kilometers in total, with average hydrogen consumption ranging between 5.6 and 8.0 kilograms per 100 kilometers, depending on use case, and an average combined vehicle weight between 16 and 34 tons.

In parallel, Daimler Truck has already started developing the next generation of its fuel-cell trucks. As part of a small-series production, a total of 100 tractor units are to be built at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Woerth and put into customer operations starting at the end of 2026.

When it comes to decarbonizing transport, Daimler Truck is pursuing a dual-track strategy with battery- and hydrogen-powered vehicles. However, the expansion of hydrogen refueling infrastructure is progressing significantly slower than expected.

As a result, customers will not be able to deploy hydrogen trucks in large numbers in the next few years. Consequently, large-scale industrialization of fuel cells and the planned series production of hydrogen-powered trucks with a focus on Europe is targeted for the early 2030s.",https://electriccarsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Daimle-Trucks.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:03:23.969031

Heavy machinery, steel beams, and hard hats mark the start of Con Edison’s Gateway Substation in Canarsie, a major step toward building a cleaner, stronger, and more reliable energy grid for New Yorkers.

Once completed in 2028, the new indoor substation will deliver reliable power to thousands of homes and businesses across Central Brooklyn. It will also connect to the Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub, bringing renewable energy — including offshore wind power — straight into the city’s power supply.

But this project is about more than technology. It’s about community and connection. Many of the Con Edison employees on-site grew up in Brooklyn and take pride in helping to strengthen the neighborhoods they know best.

“We’re building the grid of the future,” says construction manager John Carucci, “but we’re also doing it responsibly — using eco-friendly materials and aiming for LEED certification.”

For longtime residents like Winston Hoppe, who’s lived just blocks from the site for more than 30 years, the project represents real progress. “There’s more housing now and more demand for electricity,” he says. “We’ve had outages in the summer — this will help. A little disruption is worth it.”

(AP) — The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”

Suspicions about skyrocketing demand

There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.

Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.

One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft — clients, financing or otherwise — to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.

Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.

Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.

The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation’s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.

“Better data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,” the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.

Real, speculative, or ‘somewhere in between’

The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.

The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a “fundamental first step of really meeting this moment” of energy growth.

“Wherever we go, the question is, ‘Is the (energy) growth real? How can we be so sure?’” Tinjum said. “And we really view commercial readiness verification as one of those important kind of low-hanging opportunities for us to be adopting at this moment.”

Igal Feibush, the CEO of Pennsylvania Data Center Partners, a data center developer, said utilities are in a “fire drill” as they try to vet a deluge of data center projects all seeking electricity.

The vast majority, he said, will fall off because many project backers are new to the concept and don't know what it takes to get a data center built.

States also are trying to do more to find out what’s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.

In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.

They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.

Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren’t sure if the power requests “are real or just speculative or somewhere in between.”

Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.

Electricity bills are rising, too

PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.

Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects “are real, they are coming fast and furious” and that the “near-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.”

The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.

Still, PPL's projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.

Ratepayers in Burgos' Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills — attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.

That's why ratepayers need more protection to ensure they are benefiting from the higher cost, Burgos said.

“Once they make their buck, whatever company,” Burgos said, “you don’t see no empathy towards the ratepayers.”",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/11/ap25318621647754.7nRff7G4j6.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-17 17:01:58.694434

About 20 percent of planned solar capacity reported a delay, down from 25 percent in the same period in 2024.

Solar remains the country’s fastest-growing source of new generating capacity, largely from utility-scale photovoltaic projects developed by electric utilities and independent power producers. Although delays remain common, they have been trending lower, and most are short.

Even with elevated delays in 2024, the year set a record for utility-scale solar additions. Developers brought 31 gigawatts of solar capacity online, increasing the nation’s utility-scale total by 34 percent, EIA reported. Cancellations continue to be rare, with less than 1 percent of planned capacity typically withdrawn in any given month.

Project developers initially report planned online dates in the Annual Electric Generator Report. Beginning 12 months before those dates, they provide monthly updates on project status and schedule. Because many developers cannot predict the timing or length of delays, total annual additions often fall short of early-year expectations. In January 2024, developers anticipated more than 36 GW of additions, about 5 GW more than the final total.

Most reported delays occur in late construction or testing stages, often only one to two months before a project is ready to start operation. These short setbacks account for much of the slippage in reported timelines.

In EIA’s latest monthly inventory, developers plan to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online from October 2025 through September 2026. About 5 GW of that total comes from projects that have already pushed back their expected startup dates.

Developers are reportedly moving quickly to start new solar projects after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) shortened the window to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits.

“You want to find the right price, which is important, and find the quantity of power,” Gabriel said.
Different resources have different capacity and energy.” Gabriel also looked to locally source his power supply.
“Think about it like a stock portfolio.” When United Power was getting all its power from Tri-State, it was like having a single savings account.
When Kit Carson left it had 3 MW of local solar power.","When Brighton-based United Power quit its longtime power supplier, Mark Gabriel, the cooperative’s CEO, went shopping for electrons.

The Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association provided United Power with about 600 megawatts of electric capacity, and assured another 200 MWs of backup, under a 50-year contract that required the cooperative to get 95% of its electricity from the association.

That contract blocked United Power from developing more clean and local energy alternatives, which ultimately led to the co-op paying a $627 million exit fee in 2024 and then Gabriel had to replace the 800 missing megawatts.

United Power’s solution speaks to the transformation underway in the power sector as utilities scramble to find new generation sources to meet new loads. The cooperative is banking on the merchant and wholesale markets to meet its needs.

“You want to find the right price, which is important, and find the quantity of power,” Gabriel said. “It’s much like buying anything.”

“You go to one store for one thing, but you may need to go to multiple stores,” he said. “That’s kind of what we have to do. Different resources have different capacity and energy.”

Gabriel also looked to locally source his power supply. “If I don’t have to put something on transmission, I won’t,” he said. “I’m not counting on big transmission lines, which may be congested.”

To bring power into the United Power’s service area by high-voltage transmission lines, the cooperative must pay for the electricity and the cost of transmitting over the lines. If it has to use the lines of multiple utilities it pays multiple fees.

“Avoiding using transmission saves our members money,” Gabriel said.

United Power has embarked on a program to develop as many resources — large solar arrays, gas plants, batteries — as possible inside its distribution network.

“This is a really cool model,” Ric O’Connell, executive director of GridLab, a Berkeley, California-based clean energy consultant. “It’s hard to make it work, because the world is still kind of set up for big projects.”

Keeping things “hyperlocal,” Gabriel said, “can handle immediate needs faster.”

That is all more important since nailing down new supplies has been a challenge across the region. “It’s getting harder for everybody in the West,” Gabriel said. “There is a lack of capacity.”

Working out the power supply and demand problem

Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electricity provider, recently asked state regulators to allow it to run its Comanche 2 coal-fired plant, scheduled to close in December, for another 12 months because of worries about adequate capacity.

“The supply of electricity is not growing fast enough to keep up with demand growth,” said the Western Electric Coordinating Council, which oversees electricity adequacy for 14 Western states and two Canadian provinces. “What was once a simple problem of supply and demand has become complicated.”

So how has United Power charted its course? Especially as it has seen its peak demand continue to rise, reaching 653 MW in 2024.

United Power has about 113,000 customers in two service areas — one stretching from north of Denver to Longmont and another including Golden, Louisville, Black Hawk and Nederland — and it has been growing, with demand increasing as much as 4% a year.

“The big challenge was to build a portfolio with a variety of resources,” Gabriel said. “Think about it like a stock portfolio.”

When United Power was getting all its power from Tri-State, it was like having a single savings account. “Now you may have a dozen stocks or mutual funds,” he said. “We’re just trying to build that portfolio with some short-term and long-term assets.”

The principal tool the cooperative is using are purchase power agreements, or PPAs, with merchant power developers, which are in essence long-term “build it and we will buy” deals.

Merchant power — where private developers raise private capital to build power projects and then sell the electricity — had its beginning in the 1990s electricity deregulation movement.

“Merchant power has been evolving over the last 25 years,” Gabriel said. “There are a lot of different merchant suppliers out there now, and the landscape changed a lot in the last five or 10 years.”

“Storage is the new game changer”

United Power’s portfolio deals are constantly being refreshed, he said, but it has about 20 PPAs and when it can, the utility has encouraged developers to build in the cooperative’s service territory.

Solar developer Silicon Ranch has five solar installations totalling 192 MW in United Power’s area. Mountain Peak Power has a new 162-MW natural gas peaking plant to be used for high-demand periods, and Ameresco has installed 78 MW of battery storage.

The installations also bolster the local economy and tax base. “The gas plant is a really good example,” Gabriel said. “I think there’s eight or nine people that are employed there now from the local community. It’s local tax dollars.”

In all, United Power has 119 MW of batteries in nine locations across the service area each with four to six hours of capacity. They can serve to meet peak demand, or just a portion of the capacity can help balance the system.

“I call it battery slices,” Gabriel said. “It’s very flexible.”

“Storage is really the new game changer,” O’Connell of GridLab said. “If you wound the clock back 10 years, it would have been much harder for United to do what it is doing.”

Gabriel, however, has had to go farther a field than his service territory to fill his portfolio. In October, the cooperative struck an agreement with Apaya Power for the electricity from a 220-MW solar installation with battery storage in Brush. The power will be carried on Tri-State transmission lines.

United Power also has a 25-year PPA for solar from an installation in Alamosa and a 25-year agreement with NextEra Resources for power from its solar farm in Morgan County.

On any given day the last 10% of the cooperative’s demand may be covered with energy trades and purchases that may come from Tri-State, Xcel Energy or Guzman Energy, a wholesaler with whom United Power has a long-term contract.

“So it’s a much more complex model for everybody, not just for us,” Gabriel said.

United Power along with — Colorado Springs Utilities, the CORE Electric Cooperative and Platte River Power Authority — is exploring the possibility of linking the five with a transmission line.

“We abut each other, and we think it’s best to keep things local,” Gabriel said. The utilities already have the rights of way for the project. “We call it the lariat loop because we go around the Xcel system.”

Trading for a better deal on power

In May, United Power will join the Southwest Power Pool, which operates a grid and wholesale power market serving all or parts of 14 states from Texas to North Dakota. SPP is extending west and most Colorado utilities, except Xcel Energy, are becoming members.

Energy trading — buying and selling power among utilities in a regional market — is more efficient with the lowest-cost electricity available always being offered and with a single transmission charge.

“Transmission costs go down because there’ll be one unified tariff,” Gabriel said.

United Power isn’t alone among cooperatives experimenting with new models of managing their electricity needs. In 2016, Kit Carson Electric Cooperative, in Taos, New Mexico, was the first co-op to leave Tri-State and strike out on its own.

When Kit Carson left it had 3 MW of local solar power. At the end of this year it will have 52 MW of solar and 25 MW of storage — all local.

“Our daytime peak is 40 MW, so we can cover 100% of our daytime demand with renewables,” said Luis Reyes, Kit Carson’s CEO. By 2028, the co-op aims to cover its round-the-clock demand with 60% to 70% renewables.

The utility is also developing a green hydrogen storage project with the help of federal funding.

“All this is local, so it does buy us time, because I still think in the Western states, we don’t have enough transmission lines, and so it’s a plus that we’ve been able to address some of the local issues,” Reyes said.

The approach being taken by United Power and Kit Carson may not be possible for all cooperatives, Kevin Brehm, a manager in the carbon-free electricity practice at the nonprofit clean energy consultant RMI.

“Some cooperatives have more limited abilities to get renewables and build in their territory,” Brehm said, and some distant generation may still be cheaper. “We do exist within this bigger grid.”

Still, Brehm said “it seems like such a big opportunity with a win-win for community economic development as well as cost-effective power supply, and resilience potential in the future.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MOUNTAIN-PEAK-POWER-KS-11052025158.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:01:39.380766

This would make it the second time in two months and, three times in general, that the deadline is being extended as the miner struggles to keep its U.S. operations afloat.

Syrah is struggling to provide acceptable grade materials

The new agreement between Syrah and Tesla comes after Tesla’s issuance of a default notice in July in response to Syrah allegedly failing to deliver conforming active anode material samples from its Louisiana processing facility for Tesla’s electric vehicle batteries.

According to the Australian company, the original September 16 deadline, which was initially extended to November 15, has now been further pushed to January 16, 2026.

Through it all, the company has refused to admit that it is in default under the offtake agreement; despite that, Tesla has gone ahead to agree to an extension.

The contract that has prompted the extensions was drafted as far back as 2021 and aimed at supplying Tesla with 8,000 metric tons of graphite anode materials over a four-year period from its Vidalia plant in the U.S. state of Louisiana.

The facility remains the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer functioning outside China, and it has greatly helped Trump’s America reduce dependence on Chinese supplies that dominate the market.

According to what Syrah said under its agreement, Tesla has the right to terminate the offtake agreement if final qualification of the plant’s active anode material has not been achieved by February 9, 2026.

Even though it was able to secure an extension, which helps the company avoid immediate termination of the contract, its shares dropped about 3% to 29.5 cents on the ASX today, as investors reacted with disappointment.

Many of them seem to have hoped for a full resolution and another delay, even though it means Tesla is still willing to remain in bed with the company, is simply not enough after all this time.

Syrah reaches new agreement with the DFC

In a separate announcement, Syrah revealed it has reached a new agreement with the US International DFC, which provides additional funding support for its Balama Graphite Operation in Mozambique.

With the agreement, Syrah’s subsidiary Twigg is expected to get a$8.5 million disbursement from its existing DFC loan, funds that will be used for working and sustaining capital at Balama.

After the payment, the outstanding balance on the DFC loan will have risen to $68 million, excluding origination costs.

As part of the agreement, the DFC has also agreed to defer approximately $5 million in interest and fees that were due today, postponing the payment date until 15 May 2026.

Syrah will also issue the DFC warrants for around 17.5 million Syrah shares, which represent up to 1.3% of the company if exercised. The warrants will be issued at an exercise price of A$0.0001 and will last for five years after issuance.

Speaking about the partnership, Syrah’s managing director and CEO, Shaun Verner, said: “Balama is the largest integrated graphite mining and processing operation globally and is strategically important for supply chain security and the critical minerals supply required for the electric vehicle and energy transition in the US.

The directive, active from November 13, 2025, through February 10, 2026, allows PREPA to continue operating generation units essential for maintaining baseload supply while accelerating vegetation management across high-risk transmission corridors.

DOE officials pointed to the gains achieved under the May and August orders, including the restoration of up to 820 MW of baseload capacity. Several units that had been offline for years returned to service, providing roughly a 13% increase to the island’s available generation. For a system where individual unit failures can trigger island-wide consequences, those incremental restorations have been critical to avoiding deeper reliability gaps.

Operational Pressures Highlight System Vulnerabilities

Governor Jenniffer González-Colón emphasized that Puerto Rico has recovered more than 1,200 MW of baseload capacity since spring, attributing much of that progress to the emergency flexibilities that enabled PREPA to prioritize essential repairs and fast-track line clearing. Vegetation remains one of the most persistent threats to the grid; dense growth and steep terrain frequently lead to line faults during high winds, causing outages that ripple across the system.

DOE’s push to maintain emergency authority reflects the reality that Puerto Rico’s thermal fleet continues to age faster than it can be replaced. Even with restoration of large units, the overall grid remains fragile, subject to equipment failures, storm damage, and delayed maintenance cycles that have accumulated over decades.

Federal and Private Investments Are Redefining the Long-Term Outlook

The renewed emergency orders land at a moment when long-term transformation is accelerating across the island. Federal investments such as the $861.3 million initiative to expand renewable energy deployment and storage—are reshaping Puerto Rico’s future resource mix. The funding is designed to support large-scale solar development, speed interconnection timelines, and expand storage capacity enough to reduce dependence on aging thermal units.

Community-scale solar and resilience projects continue to take root as well. Recent federal programs promoting solar access for underserved neighborhoods are intended to increase energy affordability and reduce the strain on central generation—particularly during outages.

These investments complement national initiatives such as the $7 billion Solar for All program, which provided resources to expand residential and community solar in areas with high energy burdens, including Puerto Rico. The combined effect is a steady shift toward distributed generation that reduces peak load on the central system and enhances local resilience during extreme weather.

Private-sector momentum is growing in parallel. Projects like Eaton’s clean-energy microgrid installation demonstrate how commercial partners are establishing reliable, localized power systems designed to operate independently during outages. These microgrids are increasingly viewed as essential pieces of the island’s broader resilience strategy, offering operational continuity for critical community facilities.

A Transition Period Where Emergency Actions and Modernization Coexist

Puerto Rico’s grid is entering a period in which short-term stabilization and long-term transformation must operate side by side. Emergency authorities remain necessary because renewable and microgrid deployments—while accelerating—have not yet reached a scale that can fully offset the vulnerability of the existing generation fleet. Even as solar and storage installations grow, the central grid continues to shoulder the majority of the island’s load, and failures within the legacy system still carry outsized consequences.

Federal officials have signaled that the goal is to eventually phase out emergency interventions as the island’s energy system becomes more distributed, more modernized, and less dependent on large thermal units. Until then, DOE’s 202(c) orders serve as a bridge—keeping power stable enough for the long-term buildout to take hold.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251114-075244-32f-View%20of%20a%20Cobblestone%20Street%20between%20Colorful%20Buildings%20in%20San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 12:00:27.798006

The dream of geothermal energy is to meet humanity’s energy demands affordably, without harnessing horses for horsepower, slaughtering whales for their oil, or burning fossil fuels.
This partly explains why, in the field of clean energy, geothermal is often either not on the list or mentioned under the rubric of “other.” For decades, both private and government investment in geothermal energy was all but negligible.
Much of the relevant work Latimer came across turned up in papers about geothermal energy.
“I think the big question is: Who are the next nine Fervos?” Roland Horne, a professor of energy science and engineering at Stanford, who has studied geothermal energy for about fifty years, said.","When I arrived in Reykjavík, Iceland, last March, a gravel barrier, almost thirty feet at its highest point, had been constructed to keep lava from the Reykjanes volcano from inundating a major geothermal power station not far from downtown. So far, it had worked, but daily volcano forecasts were being broadcast on a small television at the domestic airport where I was waiting to take a short flight to Akureyri, a town on the north coast about an hour’s drive from one of the country’s oldest geothermal plants, the Krafla Geothermal Station. Until the early nineteen-seventies, Iceland relied on imported fossil fuels for nearly three-quarters of its energy. The resources of the country—a landscape of hot springs, lava domes, and bubbling mud pots—were largely untapped. “In the past, people here in the valley lacked most things now considered essential to human life, except for a hundred thousand million tons of boiling-hot water,” the Icelandic Nobelist Halldór Laxness wrote in “A Parish Chronicle,” his 1970 novel. “For a hundred thousand years this water, more valuable than all coal mines, ran in torrents out to sea.” The oil crisis of 1973, when prices more than tripled, proved a useful emergency. Among other efforts to develop local energy, public-investment funds provided loans for geothermal projects, whose upfront costs were considerable. By the early eighties, almost all the country’s homes were heated geothermally; in Reykjavík, a subterranean geothermal-powered system is in place to melt snow and ice off sidewalks and roads. Today, more than a quarter of the country’s electricity comes from geothermal sources, a higher proportion than in almost any other nation. Most of the rest is from hydropower.

In some ways, the process of harnessing geothermal energy is simple. The deeper you dig, the hotter the temperatures get. For direct heating, you dig relatively shallow wells (typically several hundred metres deep), to access natural reservoirs of hot water or steam, which can be piped into a structure. For electricity, wells are dug farther down, to where temperatures are above a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius. (In Iceland, this temperature is reached at around one thousand to two thousand metres deep.) Pressurized steam spins a turbine that in turn spins a generator. Thermal energy (steam) is translated into mechanical energy (the spinning turbine), which is translated into electrical energy (via the generator). Geothermal energy is essentially carbon-free, it is available at any time of day and in any weather, and it leaves a small—albeit very deep—footprint on the landscape.

In 2008, Iceland’s three largest energy companies collaborated on a research project to drill down even farther, at a site near Krafla, for steam that was even hotter, some four hundred degrees Celsius. Such “supercritical” steam is water that is so hot and pressurized that it has passed into a fourth state, beyond gas. The hotter a well the better, typically: it will produce more energy more efficiently. The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (I.D.D.P.) engineers had planned to dig down some four kilometres—but their drill got stuck at around two kilometres. Bits of black glass shot up from the well. After some disbelief, the team concluded that they had hit magma. This oops-ing into magma was at first received as “very bad news,” Bjarni Palsson, a chief project manager on the I.D.D.P. and now an executive vice-president of the energy company Landsvirkjun, told me. Many people thought that drilling into magma might trigger a volcanic eruption. “Then we started to see: What actually do we have here?” Palsson said. They put a wellhead on their work to measure the flow rates of steam. “What happened next was remarkable,” Palsson continued. The magma was about nine hundred degrees Celsius. The steam flow was such that it could produce ten times more energy than a regular well. They had created the hottest and most powerful geothermal well in the world.

The station provides power to commercial buildings and heating to homes in the district. A rust-red building in the shape of a giant barn stood across from silvery cooling towers capped by cloud-white steam. Construction began in 1974 but took four years to finish, working around the Krafla fires, a series of volcanic eruptions that went on for years. (In Icelandic folklore, the region is where the Devil landed after being expelled from Heaven.) Around the station is a volcanic valley of green vegetation and basalt rock, with patches of snow. The wellhouses appeared as igloo-size aluminum geodesic domes; like the main power station, they were rust red. Einarsson opened one for me. Visible within was a thick horizontal pipe joined to a vertical one, with what looked like a ship’s steering wheel attached. Not visible was the well itself, which extended belowground like a long metal straw. (Krafla’s geothermal wells are about seven inches across, notably narrower than many oil and gas wells.) “Some wells last twenty years, some last two—you can’t know for certain,” Einarsson explained. The temperature and permeability of the rock, as well as the amount of fluid flowing across it, affect a well’s performance. Also, Iceland has myths about “hidden people”—huldufólk. It is said that building on their land brings bad luck, so there’s that, too.

We stopped by the station’s canteen, taking our shoes off before entering. Lunch had ended, but there was homemade apple cake, dried apricots, and skyr available. Workmen in neon-yellow suits, who had traded their boots for slippers, were having tea. Einarsson then took me to the I.D.D.P. site, not far from the Krafla plant, where a sign marked a snow-covered depression about the size of a modest pond. Compared with the turbines and steam towers and the idyllic orderliness of the canteen, the site was underwhelming. Two years after the well was dug, the extreme pressure and heat began to corrode the metal casing of the well itself. Black smoke poured out each time the well was reopened. Soon, it had to be shut down permanently. In 2017, another research well, I.D.D.P.-2, was drilled down four and a half kilometres, where temperatures reached at least four hundred and twenty-six degrees Celsius—but this time the well failed after only six months. “One thing we learned is that you don’t open and close and open and close the well—you just leave it open,” Palsson had told me, explaining that such actions made the well more brittle.

Landsvirkjun, which had paid for most of the I.D.D.P. work, decided that it needed financial support to drill more exploratory wells. “We said, ‘We’re just a small energy company in Iceland,’ ” Palsson told me. But it made its research available to the international scientific community, and there has been intermittent interest from the U.K., Germany, Canada, and New Zealand. “That’s where we are now, trying to fund it as a science project that can also benefit the energy industry,” Palsson said.

Driving back to the airport, we saw snow ptarmigans and cairns of black stones marking trails that stretched beyond view. Iceland’s transition into a country powered nearly completely by renewables can seem fantastical, and the landscape furthers this impression. Because Iceland is singular in so many ways—that lonely arctic-char species! those small horses with their tölt!—you can get the feeling that geothermal energy is a niche endeavor, as opposed to one that is technically and economically feasible in places where volcanic eruptions aren’t part of the daily forecast. But that feeling is outdated and misleading.

Geothermal is underdeveloped, and its upfront costs can be high, but it’s always on and, once it’s set up, it is cheap and enduring. The dream of geothermal energy is to meet humanity’s energy demands affordably, without harnessing horses for horsepower, slaughtering whales for their oil, or burning fossil fuels. The planet’s heat could be used to pasteurize milk or heat dorm rooms or light up a baseball stadium for a night game.

At more than five thousand degrees Celsius, the Earth’s core is roughly as hot as the surface of the sun. At the Earth’s surface, the temperature is about fourteen degrees. But in some places, like Iceland, the ground underfoot is much warmer. Hot springs, geysers, and volcanoes are surface-level signs of the Earth’s inferno. Dante’s description of Hell is said by some to have been inspired by the landscape of sulfurous steam plumes found in Devil’s Valley in Tuscany.

Snow monkeys and humans have been using Earth-heated waters as baths for ages. In the Azores, a local dish, cozido de las furnas, is cooked by burying a clay pot in hot volcanic soil; in Iceland, bread is still sometimes baked this way. The first geothermal power generator was built in Devil’s Valley, in 1904, by Prince Piero Ginori Conti of Trevignano, who had been extracting borax from the area and thought to make use of the steam emerging from the mining borehole. The generator initially powered five light bulbs. Not long afterward, it powered central Italy’s railway system and a few villages. The geothermal complex is still in operation today, providing one to two per cent of Italy’s energy. In the United States, the first geothermal plant was built in 1921, in Northern California, in a geyser-filled area that a surveyor described as the gates of Hell. That plant powered a nearby resort hotel and is also still in use.

There aren’t gates of Hell just anywhere. A kilometre below ground in Kamchatka is considerably hotter than a kilometre below ground in Kansas. There is also readily accessible geothermal energy in Kenya (where it provides almost fifty per cent of the country’s energy), New Zealand (about twenty per cent), and the Philippines (about fifteen per cent)—all volcanic areas along tectonic rifts. But in less Hadean landscapes the costs and uncertainties of drilling deep in search of sufficient heat have curtailed development. This partly explains why, in the field of clean energy, geothermal is often either not on the list or mentioned under the rubric of “other.” For decades, both private and government investment in geothermal energy was all but negligible.

That has now changed. In the past five years, in North America, more than a billion and a half dollars have gone into geothermal technologies. This is a small amount for the energy industry, but it’s also an exponential increase. In May, 2021, Google signed a contract with the Texas-based geothermal company Fervo to power its data centers and infrastructure in Nevada; Meta signed a similar deal with Texas-based Sage for a data center east of the Rocky Mountains, and with a company called XGS for one in New Mexico. Microsoft is co-developing a billion-dollar geothermal-powered data center in Kenya; Amazon installed geothermal heating at its newly built fulfillment center in Japan. (Geothermal energy enables companies to avoid the uncertainties of the electrical grid.) Under the Biden Administration, the geothermal industry finally received the same kind of tax credits given to wind and solar, and under the current Trump Administration it has received the same kind of fast-track permitting given to oil and gas. Donald Trump’s Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, spoke at a geothermal conference and declared, in front of a MAGA-like sign that read “MAGMA (Making America Geothermal: Modern Advances),” that although geothermal hasn’t achieved “liftoff yet, it should and it can.” Depending on whom you speak with, either it’s weird that suddenly everyone is talking about geothermal or it’s weird that there is a cost-competitive energy source with bipartisan appeal that no one is talking about.

Scientific work that has been discarded or forgotten can return—sometimes through unknowing repetition, at other times through deliberate recovery. In the early nineteen-seventies, the U.S. government funded a program at Los Alamos that looked into developing geothermal energy systems that didn’t require proximity to geysers or volcanoes. Two connected wells were built: in one, water was sent down into fractured hot, dry rock; from the other, the steam that resulted from the water meeting the rock emerged. In 1973, Richard Nixon announced Project Independence, which aimed to develop energy sources outside of fossil fuels. “But when Reagan came into office, he changed things,” Jefferson Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University, who was involved in the Los Alamos project, told me. The price of oil had come down, and support for geothermal dissipated. “People got this impression that it was a failure,” Tester said. “I think if they looked a little closer, they would see that a lot of the knowledge gained in those first years could have been used to leverage what is happening now.”

In 2006, Tester and his colleagues published their report, “The Future of Geothermal Energy.” One finding was that new drilling technology employed by the oil-and-gas industry was changing the economics of geothermal power generation. Latent ideas—like those from the Los Alamos project—had met their moment. “I was called to testify a few times before Congress. It was a relatively modest investment that was needed, and people were excited,” Tester told me. “But then we submitted the report to the Department of Energy. And they did nothing. It was crazy.” He was still visibly dismayed.

One explanation for the lack of action is that, around that time, the U.S. went from being an oil importer to an oil exporter. This turnaround was largely due to the innovations of George Mitchell, a second-generation Greek American in Galveston, Texas, who spent years trying to extract oil and gas from the Barnett Shale formation, in North Texas, in an economically viable way. His approach synthesized hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, with horizontal drilling. Fracking involves injecting fluid down a well at high pressures, which cracks the subsurface, and the horizontal drilling augments the area of cracking. Eventually, Mitchell’s company, helped by generous tax incentives, made the economics work. Vast oil reserves became accessible. Fortunes were made. Fracking overwhelmed the renewed interest in geothermal power. But a couple of decades later there was a reversal: fracking accelerated geothermal power.

Tim Latimer, the thirty-five-year-old C.E.O. of Fervo Energy, a geothermal company founded in 2017, grew up in Riesel, Texas, a small town about fifteen miles outside Waco. After graduating from the University of Tulsa with a degree in mechanical engineering, Latimer wanted a well-paid engineering job close to home. “My adviser was just, like, ‘Have you ever heard of the oil-and-gas industry?’ ” he said, smiling.

As a greenhorn drilling engineer with the international mining company BHP Billiton, Latimer was put on a fracking project in the Eagle Ford Shale, in South Texas. The shale, which is a Cretaceous-era formation dense with marine fossils from when the area was an inland sea, is relatively hard and hot. “The motors in our drill systems were failing early,” Latimer said. His supervisors suspected that this was because of the wells’ unusually high temperatures, around a hundred and seventy-five degrees Celsius. “They said, ‘Can you research what tools we could use to deal with the fact that these drilling temperatures are really high?’ ” Latimer told me.

Much of the relevant work Latimer came across turned up in papers about geothermal energy. “I’d never heard of geothermal before,” he said. “I was, like, ‘Well, this seems pretty cool.’ ” When Latimer read the 2006 “Future of Geothermal Energy” report, including its description of the Los Alamos geothermal project, he saw parallels to his work in oil and gas. The report described two big technical challenges that were standing in the way of affordable, bountiful clean energy. One was getting drilling costs down—an area that oil and gas had made great progress in. The other was getting water flowing through hot rock that isn’t sufficiently permeable, like shale, so that you can generate steam. “And I’m just looking at the rig, being, like, ‘This is a solved problem.’ ” Generating flow where there isn’t much naturally—that’s what hydraulic fracturing does.

Latimer reported what he had found to BHP. The shale drilling started working again, but Latimer’s imagination had shifted. In 2014, he applied to Stanford Business School with the goal of using fracking technology in geothermal wells. “Geothermal is an industry that, frankly, at that point in time, people had given up on as forgotten,” he said. “I didn’t think that was right. I was, like, ‘I’m a drilling engineer. I actually have a skill that can make a direct impact on this.’ ”

In 2017, Latimer and his Stanford colleague Jack Norbeck co-founded Fervo Energy. “Fracking” is an unpopular word. Fervo describes itself as a “next-generation geothermal energy developer.” Just as the fusion-energy industry avoids the phrase “nuclear fusion,” and the term “natural gas” is now used for what is mostly methane, geothermal systems involving hydraulic fracturing tend to be referred to as “enhanced” geothermal systems, or E.G.S.

In 2023, Fervo drilled a pair of demonstration wells in Nevada, proving its ideas in anticipation of scaling them up. The goal is to begin operating a five-hundred-megawatt geothermal power plant in Cape Station, Utah, with a hundred megawatts going online in 2026. This past June, Fervo drilled a four-and-a-half-kilometre appraisal well—a well for confirming predicted subsurface conditions before going all in on a site—that reached temperatures of two hundred and seventy degrees Celsius. The well was drilled in sixteen days, remarkably fast, and faster drill times mean lowered costs. Fervo’s well design and drilling technologies are central to its hopes, and have helped it raise more than eight hundred million dollars in investment capital. Most everyone I spoke to seems to be rooting for Fervo, albeit with some skepticism. The Utah site is far away from a source for the large amounts of water that will be required, for instance. There are more technical points of concern, too. Fracking can induce seismic activity, so the siting of wells is an important consideration. Enthusiasts see these as solvable problems. And Fervo is not alone in showing promise in the use of fracking to access geothermal power. At the end of October, Mazama Energy demonstrated a pilot E.G.S. in Newberry, Oregon, that works at an even higher temperature: above three hundred degrees Celsius. For now, though, E.G.S. is still a kind of wildcat proposition. “I think the big question is: Who are the next nine Fervos?” Roland Horne, a professor of energy science and engineering at Stanford, who has studied geothermal energy for about fifty years, said. “Fervo has expanded tremendously, they’re a nearly two-hundred-person company, but they don’t have the wherewithal to do a gigawatt project yet.”

Fervo pitches itself as a landing place for oil-and-gas workers. “I’ve spent a lot of my life and career in small towns where the largest economic driver is oil and gas,” Latimer said. Geothermal means jobs in drilling: engineers, geologists, project managers. Barry Smitherman, who has worked as an oil-and-gas regulator in Texas and as the head of a utility company, told me, “We’ve been drilling oil and gas wells in Texas for over a hundred years. We’ve drilled over a million wells. We know what the world looks like below the surface in Texas.”

In February, 2021, Winter Storm Uri left most of Texas without power for days. Not long afterward, Smitherman was asked to speak to state legislators about what went wrong and what needed to change. Soon he got a call from a foundation set up by George Mitchell and his wife, Cynthia. (George, who died in 2013, is known as the “father of fracking.”) The Mitchell Foundation wanted Smitherman to help start a local organization that would advocate on behalf of geothermal energy. He co-founded the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance in 2022. During his long career in energy, Smitherman said, “we never had a conversation about geothermal. No one had brought it to my attention.” Smitherman had a series of meetings with people from geothermal startups, oil-and-gas companies, the Sierra Club, and utility companies. “What we’ve always said around energy is that you need three legs—reliable, clean, and cheap. Those are the three legs of the stool. The old saying was ‘I can give you two of three, but I can’t give you all three,’ ” he said. “But, as we began to look at geothermal, it really began to look like it had all three—low to no carbon, 24/7, and, as the cost curve comes down, eventually, cheap. It really began to look like this unicorn resource.”

Tester now teaches at Cornell, near the Finger Lakes, where in the winter Buttermilk and Taughannock Falls turn to blue ribbons of ice. “If we look at the country and say our goal is ultimately to be much more sustainable with respect to our carbon footprint, you can’t ignore heating,” Tester said. Around thirty per cent of New York State’s carbon footprint can be attributed to heating and cooling buildings, a figure that is not far from the worldwide average. “A lot of it is for space heating and water heating, but also for low-temperature food processing, things like that,” Tester added. The excitement about geothermally generated electricity can obscure the thing that geothermal technology is, arguably, best suited to provide. “It’s a little bit apples and oranges, and we need both electricity and heating,” Tester told me. But he went on to explain that using electricity for heating is not nearly as efficient as using heat for heating. And geothermal wells for heating, which can be relatively shallow, can work in places with no hot springs or volcanoes.

Midtown Manhattan, for example: as part of a major renovation completed in 2017, ten geothermal wells were dug beneath St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Some of the wells are less than a hundred metres deep, while others extend more than six hundred and fifty metres, more than ten times deeper than Manhattan’s deepest subway tunnel—and yet much shallower than the wells needed for a geothermal power plant. These wells carry warmth into the cathedral in winter, and out of the cathedral in summer, and do so with less noise and vibration than typical HVAC systems. The main issue is the upfront cost. When the cathedral’s system was built, it felt radical. One of the lead engineers on the project, Paul Boyce, of P. W. Grosser Consulting, told me that the demand for geothermal heating systems has grown dramatically since then. P.W.G.C.’s current geothermal projects include the Mastercard headquarters, in Purchase, New York, and the Obama Presidential Center, in Chicago. In Greenpoint, Brooklyn, an eight-hundred-and-thirty-four-unit apartment complex that’s under construction has its heating and cooling provided through three hundred boreholes, none much deeper than about a hundred and fifty metres. The system was put in by Geosource Energy, a geothermal company started in 2004.

But those projects provide geothermal energy building by building, not district by district. “I wish we were looking at how we plan our cities,” Tester said. “It’s crazy that heating, electricity, cable, water—these are all managed separately.” He is now in the midst of a research project that aims to demonstrate the feasibility of an ambitious geothermal system to serve Cornell’s seven-hundred-and-forty-five-acre campus, something close to what downtown Reykjavík has—but without the aid of close-to-the-surface magma. In the summer of 2022, a rig set up not far from Cornell’s School of Veterinary Medicine drilled for sixty-five days through layers of shale, limestone, and sandstone, passing beyond the geologic time of the dinosaurs to a crystalline basement dating to the Proterozoic eon, more than five hundred million years ago. This created the Cornell University Borehole Observatory (CUBO). In Iceland, if you dig down this deep, the temperatures could easily be four hundred degrees Celsius; in New York, the rocks are cooler, but the Cornell project needs to reach only eighty to ninety degrees Celsius. As CUBO was drilled, rock samples from each depth were analyzed, and the surrounding natural fracture systems were mapped. If CUBO secures more funding, the next stage will be to drill a pair of wells, with one for injecting water to make an underground reservoir and the other to bring the heated water up.

In other geographies, geothermal energy for district heating and cooling has been accomplished with shallower wells. Mieres, Spain, a historic mining town, uses warm water from the now closed mines to supply heat to the region. Nijar, also in Spain but closer to a volcano, uses an underground fluid reservoir to heat its greenhouses. Hayden, Colorado, a former coal town, is working with Bedrock Energy, a Texas-based company started in 2022, to construct a municipal geothermal district, in the hope that reduced energy bills will attract businesses. In Framingham, Massachusetts, activists and a local energy company collaborated on a geothermal heating-and-cooling network, and near Austin, Texas, the neighborhood of Whisper Valley is putting in a similar grid. Several companies, including Bedrock and Dig Energy, are aiming to bring drilling costs down by half or more. Geothermal systems for heating and cooling individual homes remain somewhat pricey to install, but they last for decades, reduce energy bills by twenty-five to fifty per cent, and avoid reliance on the ever more burdened electrical grid. Most people I spoke with in the geothermal industry make their case for it by focussing on cost savings; the unspoken climate benefits are known to those disposed to care, and potentially off-putting to those who are not.

Some environmentalists argue that the resources given to geothermal—or to small modular nuclear plants, or to fusion—would be better spent elsewhere. Why not just go all in on solar, wind, and batteries, which are proven, scalable technologies? To invest in more speculative solutions, the argument goes, is a moral hazard, and a cynical or naïve distraction that obscures the solutions available now. But this line of thinking rests on the assumption that the people or nations or agencies that would fund one kind of energy would equally fund some other kind. This tends not to be true—funding is rarely fungible, and always capricious. One geothermal-startup founder spoke of receiving a call from a potential investor’s adviser, who said, Sorry, the managing partner wants to invest in a blimp company instead. “Geothermal is the least moral hazard-y of the clean-energy technologies,” Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, said. “And we are still subsidizing nuclear a thousand times more than geothermal.”

An energy future without hydrocarbons will require working flexibly with the many variables of resources, geography, and politics. “We can get maybe ninety per cent of the way with solar, batteries, wind,” Leah Stokes, a professor of environmental politics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told me. “But geothermal is one of the things that can fill that gap.” Investment follows fashion—and geothermal has become fashionable—but it’s not only investors who appear confident about geothermal. Wagner called this “the moment when Ph.D.s meet M.B.A.s.”

The role of geothermal becomes easier to see when looking beyond the local noise of discussions in America. “You know, there’s this thing called the curse of abundance,” Agnelli Kafuwe, the principal energy officer for the Zambian government, told me. Typically, the phrase refers to countries driven into corruption and misery by their oil endowments, but Kafuwe was referring to Zambia’s seemingly boundless supply of hydroelectric energy, from power stations such as one at the Zambezi River’s Mosi-oa-Tunya, the natural feature known to most Americans as Victoria Falls.

Under the new “American Energy Dominance” policy, US taxpayers are supposed to shell out millions of dollars to keep old, outdated coal power plants up and running. Too bad all that money will go to waste. The killer combo of solar energy plus energy storage is already dominating new grid capacity additions, and now here comes the US startup First Solar with plans to expand domestic production of its next-generation thin film solar technology.

Thin Film Solar & Domestic Manufacturing

Thin film solar is just what it says. Instead of the chunks of silicon that characterize conventional solar cells, thin film solar cells can be mixed in a solution and sprayed or printed onto a surface. That opens up the potential for deploying low cost, roll-to-roll manufacturing systems, helping to push down the overall cost of solar power (see lots more thin film background here).

First Solar has its roots in the 1990 thin film solar startup Solar Cells, Inc, a specialist in the CdTe (cadmium telluride) thin film formula. Following a buyout and rebrand in 1999, the company has been making thin film solar cells under the First Solar moniker since 2002, currently billing itself as the only one among the biggest solar manufacturers in the world to be headquartered in the US. With domestic orders for its thin film technology on the rise, the missing link is a fully domestic manufacturing footprint.

First Solar has taken several steps in that direction in recent years with a healthy assist from state policy makers, including many who put aside red-state rhetoric in favor of job creation and long term economic benefits. In September of 2024, for example, state and local officials in Alabama celebrated the opening of a new First Solar factory in Lawrence County.

“First Solar is a world-class manufacturer, and its solar modules are poised to play an increasingly important role in U.S. energy self-sufficiency,” said Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who welcomed the company’s plans to invest in South Carolina back in November of 2022.

The Law Of Unintended Consequences

The abrupt shift in federal energy policy this year has put a crimp in the momentum of the domestic solar industry. Among other hurdles, in July the US Congress cut back on solar tax credits with the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” In addition, new regulations that restrict the use of overseas supply chains in domestic manufacturing will kick in next year.

Despite the fresh obstacles, the demand for solar power is not going to vanish into thin air. It’s common knowledge but worth repeating that solar and energy storage are the quickest and most competitive means of adding more generating capacity to the nation’s grid. A new analysis from Deloitte, for example, finds that renewable energy accounted for more than 90% of new capacity additions during the first half of this year, with solar and storage making up more than 80% of that figure.

With that in mind, it’s no surprise to see that First Solar plans to build yet another new US factory. To be located in the city of Gaffney in Cherokee County, South Carolina, the new facility will fabricate thin film solar cells from First Solar’s existing fleet of factories into solar modules, satisfying the demands of the forthcoming domestic manufacturing environment.

Word of the new factory leaked out through the trade press two weeks ago. On November 14 the company finally outlined its plans in a general announcement, in which it explained why it expects the venture to be a rousing success.

“The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025,” First Solar stated, giving credit where credit is due.

“The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027,” the company added, referring to the new restrictions on overseas supply chains.

Thin Film Solar & Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

Following First Solar’s lead, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster also endorsed the project as a springboard for domestic energy production.

“First Solar’s investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America’s energy independence,” McMaster said in a press statement. “Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

No kidding. Between inflation, tariffs, and job-sucking AI technology, a good job is getting harder to find these days. First Solar expects the new facility to be up and running sometime during the second half of next year, much to the relief of 600 job seekers in South Carolina.

What’s All This About Coal, Then?

First Solar also points out that the new factory will complement its five existing plants in Ohio, Alabama, and Louisiana, along with R&D facilities in California and Ohio. “By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.”

In terms of direct employment, First Solar expects to have more than 5,500 people on its direct employment rolls by the end of next year. That’s just one solar company. There are others, of course. Keep an eye on Texas, which has refashioned itself as an epicenter of solar manufacturing in the US.

In comparison, all of US coal mining only accounted for about 41,000 jobs as of August this year. It’s also worth noting that competition from wind, solar, and storage is a recent phenomenon. Coal jobs were falling by the wayside all throughout the earlier part of the 20th century as machines took over hand labor, reaching a 40-year peak of 178,000 in 1985 and dropping to 90,000 in 2011. That trend was largely spurred by the natural gas fracking boom of the early 2000s, as the cost of renewable energy was relatively high.

Now that the cost of renewables and storage has dropped, coal-friendly policy makers have a tougher row to hoe. It’s going to get tougher in the coming years. Alongside thin film solar, new energy storage systems are also emerging on the market, with new, next-generation solar materials following close behind.

Let's not lock it away. | Utility Dive,"Robert Walton, Nick Woolley",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/electric-vehicle-ev-grid-asset-charging-dr/805642/,"In contrast to other distributed energy resources like energy storage, EVs require no capital to deploy.
In the future, with vehicle-to-grid technology, we can also use the colossal latent capacity in EV batteries to export energy onto the grid.
This simple act of coordination strengthens the grid, prevents blackouts and lowers costs for everyone, not just EV drivers.
If we create an open road, we can bring every stakeholder to the table and enable truly dynamic load shifting, critical to reducing energy rates.
Committing to this shared vision is our direct route to finally lowering electricity rates for everyone.","Soaring electricity prices are squeezing American households and businesses, and are expected to continue rising. Simultaneously, a quiet revolution is taking place in our driveways: Over 7 million electric vehicles have already been sold in the U.S. Right now, we treat them as just cars, but they are also massive, mobile batteries that have the potential to slash electricity rates for every American household by as much as 10% and deliver over $30 billion in annual grid benefits by 2035 — all without disrupting EV drivers’ needs.

In contrast to other distributed energy resources like energy storage, EVs require no capital to deploy. People are already buying EVs to drive places. When we tap into them when they are not being used, we’re tapping an asset with no additional costs. But we are at a critical moment and must move forward with openness, to achieve scale and avoid squandering the momentum we’ve gained so far.

The technology to unlock this value is called “managed charging.” Instead of every EV charging the moment it’s plugged in, creating huge spikes in demand for electricity, managed charging allows vehicles to intelligently draw power when it’s cheapest and most abundant, such as overnight or when solar and wind generation is high — and when vehicles are already plugged in and have plenty of time to charge. In the future, with vehicle-to-grid technology, we can also use the colossal latent capacity in EV batteries to export energy onto the grid. This simple act of coordination strengthens the grid, prevents blackouts and lowers costs for everyone, not just EV drivers.

Pioneering programs from California to New York are already proving this works for tens of thousands of drivers. The technology is secure, tested and ready to scale. The question now facing industry leaders is no longer whether managed charging works, but how to implement it. Will we build an open, competitive and consumer-friendly energy future, or will we allow a few dominant players to create closed, proprietary “toll roads” that lock in consumers, stifle innovation and raise electricity rates everywhere across the U.S.?

The first path, built on interoperability and open standards, accelerates innovation with a dynamic marketplace. In this future, an EV driver can choose to enroll and coordinate their charging anywhere, using any app or service provider. An open, omni-channel experience enables users to enroll from wherever they are and maximizes the potential for growth. This is critical if demand flexibility is to scale and reach its potential to drive down all of our energy bills. And it’s just like the internet, where you can browse on multiple devices, across different browsers, in any location.

We know this is the model that built the modern technology economy — one of explosive innovation driven by open access. It’s also the foundation for a competitive market where the many buyers and providers of demand flexibility can all participate, from vehicle or charger integrations to utilities’ advanced metering infrastructure. Limiting market interactions to one pathway interferes with the market and misses the opportunity to optimize energy supply and demand.

The open road creates a clear win-win-win. For automakers, it accelerates EV adoption by making ownership more affordable and appealing, increasing sales volume. For utilities, it provides the dynamic grid control needed to improve reliability and integrate more renewables. And most importantly, for consumers, it delivers real reductions on their monthly electricity bills and preserves their freedom of choice to interact with their charging through any service provider, whether that’s an OEM, an energy utility, or other third party.

The second path is a toll road leading to a monopolistic future. In this scenario, a few powerful players become roadblocks, controlling access to the vehicle’s charging data, gating it behind exorbitant fees or locking consumers into their proprietary systems. Competition withers. Participants are shut out of the market because there’s not enough value left to incentivize them to do the right thing. Instead of reducing energy bills, this approach will bake in new costs for consumers and create a new, unnecessary class of gatekeepers. We’ve seen this movie before with closed technology ecosystems, and it always ends with less choice, higher utility bills, lower participation rates and a less equitable energy transition.

If we create an open road, we can bring every stakeholder to the table and enable truly dynamic load shifting, critical to reducing energy rates. Previous approaches to managing demand, like electricity rates that vary by time of day based on general usage patterns, have been a valuable first step, but this static tool is now showing its limitations. In some areas, these rates have actually created new, artificial “charging peaks” at the start of an “off peak” time period that can stress the grid more than the problem they were designed to solve. This isn’t smart management; it’s just moving the problem around. What we need is a system that responds dynamically to the shifting needs of the grid, the user and capabilities of the charging equipment. This requires an open road, with everyone playing their part to drive costs down.

By choosing collaboration over confrontation and embracing a foundation of open standards, decision-makers from the automotive, utility, policy and technology sectors can unleash a new era of American innovation.

The company currently has three US manufacturing facilities in Ohio, one in Alabama and one in Louisiana, as well as research and development (R&D) facilities in Ohio and California. The newest facility, in Louisiana, began production earlier this year.

First Solar’s decision to expand its US manufacturing presence is a direct response to the US government’s trade policies and the passage of the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) act which set more stringent rules on sourcing renewable energy technologies and components.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

First Solar said it expects its US production to be “fully compliant” with the new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which were introduced under the OBBB and limit the access of China-based or Chinese-backed companies to the US renewables market. Widmar previously said that the OBBB “strengthens” First Solar’s position in the US market – this is largely due to its use of CdTe technology, which is isolated from the silicon-based supply chain that dictates most of the global industry.

As well as benefitting from greater protectionism by the Trump administration – measures which are likely to cause problems for its silicon-based competitors – First Solar will be pleased with the decision of the US Geological Survey to include tellurium in its list of Critical Minerals.

In Gaza, Israeli forces have killed at least three Palestinians as Israel continues to violate the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Since the start of the truce on October 10, at least 266 Palestinians have been killed and 635 wounded by Israeli attacks. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel is reporting that at least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since October 2023, and that the real death toll is likely to be much higher because hundreds of people detained in Gaza are still missing. Meanwhile, UNICEF estimates more than 600,000 Palestinian children have missed out on school during the war, and only 100,000 have managed to return to classrooms. Humanitarian NGOs say Israel is still restricting the entry of food aid and other critical supplies into the Gaza Strip. Here’s Zahia Al-Shambari, who waited in line to buy bread in Khan Younis.

Zahia Al-Shambari: “After two hours of struggle at the supermarket to get a bag of bread, thank God, I finally got one bag of bread for about eight people. I’m really happy that I’m returning with a bag of bread. And I hope the suffering doesn’t happen again, not today, not tomorrow, not any other day.”

This comes as the U.N. Security Council is set to vote today on a U.S. proposal to establish an International Stabilization Force to enforce the Gaza ceasefire. The U.S.-drafted resolution also mentions the possibility of a future Palestinian state. But on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outright rejected any path for Palestinian statehood.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory west of the Jordan River, this opposition exists, is valid and has not changed one bit. I have been rebuffing these attempts for decades, and I am doing it both against pressure from outside and against pressure from within. So I do not need affirmations, tweets or lectures from anyone.”

Meanwhile, new details are emerging about a shadowy organization called Al-Majd Europe that’s been taking Palestinians in Gaza to South Africa. The organization reportedly has ties to Israel. Last week, a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians landed in Johannesburg. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said, “It does seem like they were being flushed out” of Gaza.

President Trump said Sunday he was open to talks with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as he considers whether to launch a unilateral attack on Venezuela. In brief remarks to reporters, Trump did not offer details about the possible discussions but said, “Venezuela would like to talk.” Trump’s remarks came as Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated the organized criminal group Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. U.S. officials have claimed without evidence Maduro and other government officials lead the cartel. Trump has claimed that allows the Pentagon to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it had killed another three people in the eastern Pacific accused of smuggling drugs by sea, though officials offered no evidence. That brings the reported toll to 83 people killed across 21 strikes since early September.

This comes amid the largest buildup of U.S. forces in the Caribbean since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, involving nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 15,000 sailors and Marines. In Caracas, President Nicolás Maduro warned the U.S. public against allowing the Trump administration to lead the U.S. into a new “forever war” in South America.

President Nicolás Maduro: “Do we want another Gaza, now in South America? What do the people of the United States say? Do you want a new Afghanistan? Do you want Vietnam again? Do you want Libya once more? Or worse, do you want a new Gaza in South America? Let me tell you: no, no and no. Here peace will triumph, international law will triumph.”

Masked federal immigration officers fanned out across Charlotte over the weekend, sparking protests as the Trump administration shifted its mass deportation campaign to North Carolina’s largest city. Democratic Governor Josh Stein said the agents were carrying out racial profiling and stoking fear.

Gov. Josh Stein: “We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks.”

Among those targeted were landscapers decorating Christmas trees and congregants of an east Charlotte church volunteering to tend a garden. In another incident shared widely on social media, masked federal agents pulled over Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, a Honduras-born U.S. citizen, and forced him from his vehicle.

Willy Wender Aceituno Medina: “No. If you break it, you will pay for it. If you break it, you will pay for it. If you break my window.”

CBP agent: “Get out!”

Willy Wender Aceituno Medina: “Why did you do this, sir? Why are you doing this?”

Aceituno told reporters he warned the agents he was a U.S. citizen but that they didn’t believe him. He suffered cuts to his arm and a neck injury. He later filed a police report over the broken glass.

President Trump has called on House Republicans to approve a measure compelling the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. Trump’s reversal late Sunday came after he unsuccessfully lobbied Republican Congresswomen Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace to remove their names from a discharge petition seeking the files’ release. This follows months of stonewalling by the Trump administration over the files’ release, and after Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson adjourned the House early to prevent a vote on the Epstein files. On Friday, Trump demanded the Justice Department investigate a list of powerful Democrats discussed in a trove of newly released emails from Jeffrey Epstein — but omitted his own name. The list includes former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman. Trump wrote on social media, “Epstein was a Democrat and he is the Democrats problem, not the Republicans problem!”

The Georgia election interference case against President Trump and his allies will now have a new prosecutor after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was removed from the case. The executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, Pete Skandalakis, is set to take over the case. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis told the Associated Press, “I doubt anything will ever move forward with the president.” But the case could proceed against 14 other Trump allies, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Trump has pardoned Giuliani, Meadows and dozens of other Republican officials and activists accused of helping him overturn the results of the 2020 election, but the pardons only apply to federal cases, not the Georgia election interference case, which is a state-level prosecution.

In the Philippines, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets Sunday to demand accountability over a corruption scandal that exposed how top government officials were receiving kickbacks from construction companies responsible for faulty and incomplete flood defense projects. The three-day protest rally comes after typhoons battered the Philippines earlier this month, leaving at least 259 people dead.

Armelyn Bandril: “Almost a hundred days has passed since the process began, yet no one has been jailed. There already is plenty of proof. A lot of evidence has come out. But our question is: How come no one has been jailed yet?”

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least 32 people were killed after a bridge at a copper and cobalt mine collapsed due to overcrowding. A government agency report said gunfire from soldiers at the site sparked panic among the miners, who rushed to the bridge, causing it to collapse. The DRC is the world’s largest producer of cobalt, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.

A BBC investigation has uncovered new evidence that implicates two U.S. Marines in the killing of Iraqi civilians in Haditha two decades ago. The BBC reports statements and testimony given in the aftermath of the Haditha massacre raise doubts about the investigation into what happened November 19, 2005, when U.S. forces slaughtered 24 Iraqis, posing significant questions over how U.S. armed forces are held to account. Just one U.S. soldier was convicted of a crime over the massacre. Marine Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich was found guilty of negligent dereliction of duty in 2012 and served no jail time.

Disability rights advocate and writer Alice Wong has died at the age of 51. When Wong was born with muscular dystrophy in 1974, doctors said she wouldn’t live to the age of 18.

This is Alice Wong speaking with Democracy Now! in 2021.

Alice Wong: “I think a lot of people in the public do not know what ableism is, and if they hear about it, they actually deny that it exists. … You know, ableism is systemic. And it’s really bound up with hypercapitalism and white supremacy.”

So far, the EPA’s proposal for the 2026 and 2027 RFS mandates has drawn the support of farm-state lawmakers — who often find themselves at odds with the Trump administration over issues such as trade policy — and put some of the president’s oil industry allies on the defensive.

The proposed updates, released in June, would increase the program’s renewable volume obligations, which dictate how much biofuel — such as corn-based ethanol and biodiesel made from feedstocks like soybean oil and animal fats — is mixed into the nation’s transportation fuel supply.

The agency is now sifting through public comments, submitted during a period that ended Oct. 31, before sending a draft final rule to the White House Budget office for review.

Imports penalized

Under the proposed rule, the renewable fuel volume requirement would rise from the current standard by about 1.7 billion ethanol-equivalent gallons in 2026 and 2.1 billion EEGs in 2027.

And, in a departure from current policy, the proposal would cut in half the value of renewable identification numbers, or RINs — tradeable credits oil refiners can buy in lieu of meeting their biofuel blending targets — for imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks.

These changes would provide a competitive advantage to U.S. farmers and biofuel producers, who would benefit from the larger renewable volume obligations, known as RVOs, combined with larger RIN values for their domestic products that make them more attractive.

But they could make meeting those obligations more costly for refiners. To keep expenses down while maintaining compliance with RFS requirements, refiners often rely on a global supply of feedstocks and biofuels. Industry sources say this is at least partly because domestic supplies are insufficient to meet RFS volume obligations.

“You can think of it this way — that biofuel producers end up getting a subsidy out of this program, but oil producers end up getting taxed because they have to comply with this and actually buy those tradeable credits,” said Nafisa Lohawala, a fellow at Resources for the Future whose research focuses on transportation issues. “The fact that the incentives are quite different on both sides means that their priorities are going to be quite different.”

Members representing farm states — including Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. among others — have been outspoken in their support for the RFS update as proposed in June.

“I’m hoping to see a standard that gets finalized before the end of the year that gives our growers in Illinois and throughout the Midwest, especially our corn and soybean growers — who are growing for the ethanol and the biodiesel that we make right here — some certainty around the RFS,” Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., said in an interview.

Budzinski was one of 48 farm state lawmakers who wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin last month urging his agency to stick with the higher standards, despite opposition from refining state members.

Oil state lawmakers, meanwhile, are concerned that the proposal would force U.S. refiners to raise costs, making their products less competitive.

“Domestic producers rely on global supply chains for cost-effective feedstocks and imports are critical to the viability of the domestic refinery industry,” a group of 40 House Republicans wrote to Zeldin in September. “If the RIN value for foreign feedstocks is reduced, domestic fuel manufacturers will be at a competitive disadvantage compared to foreign producers, hampering President Trump’s strategy to unleash American energy.”

Small-refinery exemptions

Also at issue is whether and to what degree larger refiners may have to take on the extra obligations that result from small-refinery exemptions, known as SREs, that are sometimes granted by EPA to small refiners that can demonstrate “disproportionate economic hardship.”

The EPA has historically taken differing approaches to handling the waived volumes, given their impact on the overall blending mandate. But whether those gallons should be reallocated or reduced under the new guidelines has been cause for debate. The September House GOP letter to Zeldin, which included the party’s full Texas delegation, urged him not to reallocate the waived volumes.

“SREs are essential to helping small refineries manage the regulatory costs of the RFS program, but it is critical these obligations are not transferred to other refineries,” they said. “Reallocating these obligations would place an undue burden on companies that have invested billions of dollars to legally comply with the program and create significant disruptions in the fuel market.”

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, took the matter further, complaining about the influence of the “swampy corn lobby” and introducing a bill to block EPA from implementing reallocation.

“By jamming through more biofuels and environmental compliance costs, the corn lobby is stifling US energy producers and jacking up the price of fuel,” Lee, who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a September news release announcing his bill. “It’s bad for refineries, bad for American families, and bad for American energy independence.”

The following week, EPA issued a supplemental proposal that added the option of partial reallocations to the mix. But the farm state lawmakers told Zeldin 100 percent reallocation would be best for the heartland.

“Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won’t reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump,” the bipartisan and bicameral group of farm state lawmakers said in their letter to Zeldin. “Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices.”

‘Death by a thousand cuts’

Oil industry insiders say that, taken together, increased RVOs, reduced RIN values for foreign-produced feedstocks and potential SRE reallocations could increase the cost of compliance.

“It’s really kind of death by a thousand cuts,” an industry source said. “And what our fear is is that if all these things go forward, there essentially aren’t enough RINs to buy, and compliance becomes very difficult for refiners.”

Asked about those concerns, Budzinski said, “I don’t see it.”

“I think that this allows our ethanol and biodiesel industries to have competitive equal footing with the oil refineries,” she said, “especially during a time when our growers are going through a lot of uncertainty within the farm economy itself.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/dem_retreat_613_031325.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 11:09:02.312777

To do otherwise is to poorly serve the future generations who will bear the brunt of our neglect,” said Pinsky. “We must not fail to hear the pulse of the planet amid the daily political static. Climate change is real, happening now, and can begin to be corrected by coupling cleaner energy technologies with political and decisive action.”

“Maryland is already moving — solving problems, proving concepts, and scaling solutions,” added Ortiz. “We’re coming together across sectors, and our job now is simple: keep the momentum going.”

The Forum also feature breakout sessions featuring local and state government representatives, climate resiliency experts, and private industry and nonprofit partners and discussions centered on best practices and scalable strategies for clean energy development, building resilient communities, strengthening community engagement, and mobilizing climate finance.

Maryland’s Chief Sustainability Officer Meghan Conklin closed the program discussing several of the advancements Governor Wes Moore’s administration is implementing at the State level on climate and sustainability and encouraged local governments and agencies to do the same.

“During these trying times at the Federal level, I am proud to highlight the record of accomplishments on climate, clean energy, and the environment of the Moore-Miller Administration, such as Governor Moore's historic agreement to provide $340 million to improve water quality at the Conowingo Dam,” said Conklin.

“Today’s gathering showed that leaders across multiple sectors in Maryland increasingly recognize that clean energy is cheap energy,” said Tim Lattimer, Administrator, Office of Community Sustainability. “By bringing the public and private sectors to forge closer partnerships, we can boost economic prosperity, secure reliable and affordable energy, and safeguard our environment for ourselves, our kids, and generations to come.”

Since taking office in December 2018, Ball’s administration quickly stepped up Howard County’s climate leadership by signing the “We Are Still In” declaration in support of the Paris Agreement and joining the U.S. Climate Alliance in early 2019. In 2020, the County executed Maryland’s largest solar power purchase agreement (PPA). Projected to save the County about $30 million in energy costs over 25 years, through this innovative deal, a solar provider has installed and maintained solar panels across various County properties at its own expense and then sells the electricity generated at an affordable rate. With these PPA projects now nearly 97 percent complete, the County today generates enough clean solar power to meet the electricity needs of more than half of all County Government buildings.

In 2022, the County became the first county to be certified as ‘LEED Platinum for Cities and Communities’ by the U.S. Green Building Council.

In July 2025, Ball signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) to enhance collaboration on climate and sustainability priorities with the Columbia Association (CA). This MOU leverages the strengths of local county partners to elevate the County’s ‘Howard County Climate Forward’ from a “whole-of-government” effort to a “whole-of-community” approach.

Additionally, this past August, Ball signed a climate and energy independence MOU with Howard Community College (HCC) and Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) to enhance collaboration between the County, HCPSS, and HCC and strengthen local action on energy production and independence. The MOU provides a framework for Howard County, HCPSS, and HCC to collaborate on energy generation, transportation, waste management, stormwater, nature-based climate solutions, ecosystem services, emergency management, infrastructure and heat resiliency, education, and community engagement campaigns and programs. The County and these two education partners are currently working toward developing a second solar PPA.

In addition, the County has:

Expanded solar deployment countywide by 23 percent this past year alone, reaching 150 megawatts installed, which is already one-third of the County’s Howard County Climate Forward 2030 target;

Implemented new building codes that ensure every new home or business constructed in Howard County will be solar-ready, EV-ready, and electric HVAC-ready, embedding tomorrow’s progress into every blueprint;

Established a Solar Implementation Task Force, a cross-departmental team of experts across the County working to bring more clean energy online faster. The Task Force aims to streamline processes to help accelerate clean energy deployment in pursuit of the County’s goal of reaching 437 megawatts of solar by 2030;

From July through September, six charging stations switched on at Cracker Barrel restaurants in the Deep South, for example.
The charger growth is at odds with estimates that EV sales will stall in the coming years without federal subsidies.
A January executive order from Trump froze a $5 billion program to stand up charging stations in rural areas and disadvantaged communities.
On Sept. 17, Illinois — one of the states that sued — awarded $18 million to build 25 new charging stations along its interstate corridors.","(Bloomberg) —

Americans just lost federal tax credits for buying an electric vehicle, but charging one has grown more convenient in recent months.

About 780 public high-speed charging stations opened in the US in the third quarter, the largest such infrastructure boom on record, according to Department of Energy data. The nation’s charging infrastructure expanded by 19% in the first nine months of the year.

“The growth is pretty amazing right now given current policy and investment sentiment,” said Chris Pierce, an analyst covering charging networks at Needham & Co. investment bank.

Many of the new stations were likely given the green light before President Donald Trump took office, according to Pierce. However, charging executives say the market for electrons is still underserved, even though EV sales are expected to slow without federal incentives.

“For a long time, the market was totally lopsided with a scarcity of chargers,” Pierce said. “Now, it’s getting a little less scarce, but we’re still nowhere near a saturation point.”

Though early EV adopters tend to charge at home, newer converts are far more likely to charge in the wild, according to EVgo Inc., which operates one of the largest charging networks in the US. Battery-powered cars are particularly popular among rideshare drivers, and the market for used EVs is booming.

“The recent trend of more electric vehicles per fast charger is likely to continue,” EVgo Chief Executive Officer Badar Khan told investors on an August earnings call.

The charging map is also being filled in by restaurants and retail stores, which increasingly see cords as a way to attract customers. From July through September, six charging stations switched on at Cracker Barrel restaurants in the Deep South, for example. The list of openings in the past three months also included 14 at Target Corp. stores; 12 at Wawa Inc. outlets; and four apiece at Ikea and Dunkin’ donut shops.

Pilot Travel Centers LLC, which owns about 800 truck stops and travel centers in the US, has been particularly aggressive. The company now has chargers in slightly more than a quarter of its locations, including 27 stations that switched electron pumps on in the most recent quarter.

Pilot has been adding chargers in places that until recently were electron deserts, namely the Dakotas, the Deep South and Wyoming. “We are committed to showing all of our guests that they matter,” Brandon Trama, the company’s head of vehicle electrification, said via e-mail.

The charger growth is at odds with estimates that EV sales will stall in the coming years without federal subsidies. Last month, Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley posited that the electric share of US car sales may fall from around 10% to around 5% in the fourth quarter.

However, charging executives remain sanguine. Charging infrastructure, they note, is still catching up to EV adoption and sales of new EVs may prove more resilient than expected, particularly as prices drop and more affordable models debut. Indeed, the US still has one of the developed world’s largest imbalances between registered EVs and public chargers.

“There’s just a bunch of things happening out there that are going to bring the selection up and the price down on EVs,” ChargePoint Holdings Inc. CEO Rick Wilmer told investors in September, “which we believe will drive overall demand for EVs and thus, charging going forward in the future.”

While federal dollars may no longer be flowing to EV buyers, the spigot has once again opened for chargers. A January executive order from Trump froze a $5 billion program to stand up charging stations in rural areas and disadvantaged communities. However, in June a federal court ordered the administration to restore funds to 14 states that sued over the suspension.

On Sept. 17, Illinois — one of the states that sued — awarded $18 million to build 25 new charging stations along its interstate corridors.

As of 17 November 2025, EGCO Group currently has a total equity capacity of 6,735 MWe in operation and under construction.
The renewable energy portfolio includes hydropower, solar power, onshore and offshore wind power, biomass, fuel cells, and battery storage.
EGCO Group has investments in seven countries, including Thailand, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and USA.
EGCO Group is proud to be named a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for each of the past 5 years running.","Electricity Generating Public Company Limited or EGCO Group, reported operating results for both the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2025, supported by strong cash flow and steady financial growth.

The performance was mainly driven by the operation of its hydropower plants in Lao PDR, an infrastructure solutions company CDI Group in Indonesia, and successful investments in the United States. Looking ahead, the company will continue expanding its portfolio of natural gas-fired and renewable power plants both domestically and internationally.

Mr. Tawatchai Sumranwanich, President of EGCO Group, said, “The operating performance in the third quarter and the nine months of this year clearly underscores EGCO Group’s efficiency in managing our assets and investment portfolio, as well as our ability to strengthen our financial position amid numerous challenges in both domestic and international power and energy markets. During this period, EGCO Group has continued to make significant strategic moves, including the completion of a 49% acquisition of the 125 MW Wheatsborough Solar power plant in Ohio, the United States which is the second of two clean energy projects in the Pinnacle II Portfolio acquired by EGCO Group. In addition, EGCO Group has increased its stake in Linden Cogeneration, a 980 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, to 38%. This reinforces EGCO Group’s strategic presence in the U.S. power market.”

In Q3/2025, EGCO Group recognized a total revenue of THB 6,928 million, an operating profit of THB 844 million, and a net loss of THB 656 million. Key contributors of the operating profit were the performance of the two hydropower plants in Lao PDR – Nam Theun 2 and Xayaburi -supported by high water levels during the rainy season. Additional positive contributions came from international power plants, including Linden Cogen and Compass Portfolio in the United States, Paju ES in South Korea, San Buenaventura in the Philippines, as well as the infrastructure solutions company CDI Group in Indonesia.

However, several factors significantly affected Q3/2025 results. These include the scheduled outage maintenance of the Quezon power plant in the Philippines in preparation for its commercial operation date (COD) on 26 October 2025, under the new Power Supply Agreement (PSA). The third quarter’s performance was also impacted by the effects of fair value measurement of financial instruments and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which are accounting-related items that are specific to the period and do not affect the long-term return generating potential.

For the nine-month period of 2025, EGCO Group posted a total revenue of THB 29,126 million, an operating profit of THB 4,348 million, and a net profit of THB 5,078 million. Key contributors to this 9M/2025 performance included the hydropower plants in Lao PDR, the San Buenaventura power plant in the Philippines, the Paju ES power plant in South Korea, and the U.S. power plants. The company also recognized gain from the divestment of its investments in the RISEC power plant in the United States and the Boco Rock Wind Farm in Australia. These divestments align with EGCO Group’s asset recycling strategy, under which assets are sold at an appropriate time and the proceeds reinvested in new projects.

Mr. Tawatchai added, “The outlook of the total operating performance in 2025 will be supported by revenue contributions from international projects in which the company has invested, including the Pinnacle II Portfolio with a combined capacity of 251 MW and the increased ownership interest in the Linden Cogen to 38%. The company also anticipates that its U.S. power assets will benefit from rising electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centers and AI-related industries, alongside generally positive electricity market conditions in the United States.”

In terms of new investments, EGCO Group continues to pursue strategic initiatives, including seeking investment opportunities within its core power business. The company is focusing on natural gas-fired and renewable energy projects that support its Net Zero emissions target. This includes investments through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as greenfield developments in markets where the company already operates and has local partners – particularly in the United States, where EGCO Group has steadily expanded its presence over the past five years.

For domestic investments, the company is awaiting the results of the second round of the RE Big Lot, in which EGCO Group has been shortlisted for 11 projects with a combined installed capacity of 448 MW. The company is also exploring the feasibility of the direct PPA policy, which allows private-sector entities to purchase electricity directly from clean energy producers.

As of 17 November 2025, EGCO Group currently has a total equity capacity of 6,735 MWe in operation and under construction. Total equity capacity from renewable energy is 1,535 MWe (equivalent to 23% of the total portfolio). The renewable energy portfolio includes hydropower, solar power, onshore and offshore wind power, biomass, fuel cells, and battery storage. EGCO Group has investments in seven countries, including Thailand, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and USA.

In addition to its power business, EGCO Group has other energy-related businesses including fuel and utilities infrastructure as well as customer solution and start-up businesses. The associated subsidiaries include EGCO Engineering and Service Co., Ltd. (ESCO) which provides power plant operations, maintenance, and engineering services, the infrastructure and utilities company CDI Group in Indonesia, Thai Pipeline Network Co., Ltd.

Data Center Demand Everywhere, but Not a Drop for Natural Gas to Drink?

November 14, 2025

Data center electricity demand is beginning to emerge in near-term natural gas forecasts after a year of muted expectations that contrasted sharply with bullish narratives brought about by artificial intelligence (AI) demand growth. Analysts, however, remain divided on whether meaningful gas impacts are materializing, or whether the surge remains years away.",https://apppack-app-naturalgasintel-prod-publics3bucket-8jv5bxjtvpgq.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Former-Tellurian-Executive-Chair-.width-900.format-webp.webp,N,,2025-11-17 13:03:14.856485

This reflects an increase of 17.6% from the previous year’s electric car sales.
Investors looking to benefit from the strong EV sales growth outlook may choose to invest directly in electric car stocks like Tesla TSLA, or in companies such as BYD Company BYDDF, which is known for manufacturing EV batteries.

This reflects an increase of 17.6% from the previous year’s electric car sales.

Against this backdrop, investors interested in making an entry in the electric vehicle (EV) market space may consider keeping a watch on prominent EV-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF DRIV, KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility ETF KARS, State Street SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF HAIL and iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF IDRV.

Why ETFs and Not Individual Stocks?

As demand for passenger and goods transport continues to rise rapidly worldwide, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, EVs play a critical role in the decarbonization of the transport sector. Investors looking to benefit from the strong EV sales growth outlook may choose to invest directly in electric car stocks like Tesla TSLA, or in companies such as BYD Company BYDDF, which is known for manufacturing EV batteries.

However, it is worth mentioning that both Tesla and BYD Company are dealing with crucial challenges at the moment, albeit of different kinds. Tesla has been facing increasing competition from Chinese automakers, who offer a wider range of more affordable EV models. This has put significant pressure on the American EV maker’s sales performance in recent quarters.

Notably, after suffering its first-ever annual delivery decline in 2024, Tesla started 2025 on a rough note, with sales falling by double digits in the first two quarters. While the third quarter offered Tesla a temporary breather as buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit, fourth-quarter deliveries are once again expected to decline amid the withdrawal of incentives and intense competition from Chinese EV makers.

Meanwhile, the stock’s high valuation is tied to a great extent to the future success of its innovative technologies like autonomous robotaxis and humanoid robots, rather than the performance of its core EV business.

On the other hand, BYD Company's aggressive pricing strategy and a bruising price war in the Chinese market led it to lose profit margins. Moreover, after a period of explosive growth, its sales momentum has stalled in its home market of China due to increased scrutiny of price discounting and strong competition from other domestic rivals like Xiaomi and Geely.

Considering the aforementioned discussion, it is safe to conclude that investment in an ETF might be a smarter move for an investor eager to profit from the EV market’s tailwind without being exposed to the company-specific financial challenges and competitive pressures that can severely impact individual stocks like Tesla or BYD Company’s performance.

This round-up brings you the key stories from the energy sector over recent weeks.

Top energy news: Digital power system transformation ‘essential’; IEA's World Energy Outlook 2025; batteries ‘crucial’ to lives and economies.

For more on the World Economic Forum’s work in the energy space, visit the Centre for Energy and Materials.

1. Digital transformation of power systems essential, says IRENA

The digital transformation of energy systems is no longer optional but a ""decisive enabler"" of electrification and decarbonization, according to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The agency’s Digitalisation and AI for Power System Transformation report, which it developed together with the G7 Presidency, says that the COP28 goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 can be ""catalyzed by digitalization"".

With many countries recognizing digitalization as a strategic priority in energy planning, the report highlights a window of opportunity for the G7 to ""set the direction for power system transformation"" and unlock benefits for consumers and businesses while boosting energy security and affordability.

IRENA identifies five key areas in which digital technologies can transform power systems: monitoring through smart sensors and metres; AI-enhanced forecasting for demand and renewable generation; operational optimization to reduce losses and congestion; end-use automation for demand response; and transparency through digital platforms and energy certificates.

The chart below, based on a BNEF analysis featured in the IRENA report, shows where digitalization in the power sector is currently focused.

2. World Energy Outlook 2025: IEA report

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its annual World Energy Outlook report, which explores the future of energy security, access and emissions.

Here are some of its key findings:

Energy security concerns are on the rise due to geopolitical tensions, supply risks (especially critical minerals) and the vulnerability of electricity systems to cyber and weather threats.

Global energy demand keeps rising, led by emerging economies like India and those in Southeast Asia, while energy use in richer countries levels off.

The world is witnessing record growth in both fossil fuel and renewable energy use, but renewables — especially solar and wind— continue to be the fastest-growing sources.

The availability and supply chain for critical minerals is now a real concern. The report highlights the need for more resilient and diverse supply chains.

Grid investments are lagging behind power generation, creating risks of congestion and outages.

3. News in brief: More energy stories from around the world

The United States is looking to advance its energy ties with Greece, the US ambassador to the country has said. The US believes the country could become a key energy gateway to Europe, Kimberly Guilfoyle said. Greece has increased purchases of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and built a second LNG terminal in a bid to become a major route for US-imported gas into Europe.

Australia is planning to require energy companies to offer three hours of free electricity to households during the day in a bid to use excess solar capacity and ease demand on the grid. Solar supply is strongest during the day in the country, where more than 4 million households have rooftop solar panels that generate more electricity than their residual coal-fired power stations.

A report from Schneider Electric says that energy companies in the Middle East are setting the pace for autonomous operations, with almost 80% of leaders reporting advanced operational readiness. Compared to the global energy sector, which typically operates at lower levels of autonomous operations – characterized by connected systems and visible data but still reliant on manual decision-making – many Middle East organizations claim to be operating with selective autonomy, where systems function independently in specific scenarios with limited human intervention.

Planned rules in India to require renewable energy producers to strictly adhere to their promised power delivery could hit company earnings and slow clean energy investment, according to industry letters reviewed by Reuters. Some wind projects could lose up to 48% of their revenue, it warned.

French state-owned power utility EDF is looking to finalize the conceptual design of a small modular reactor by 2026. The company is aiming to have up to 30 of the reactors in operation by 2050, it has said.

But systems that have not yet detected PFAS or have more recently detected PFAS (“Phase 2” systems) must initiate the claim process by 2026. Specifically, all Phase 2 water systems must file a claim no later than January 1, 2026, to be compensated for their PFAS baseline testing of their water sources, under both the 3M and Dupont settlements. To file a claim for treatment and costs against the Dupont fund, Phase 2 water systems must file by June 30, 2026. To file such a claim against the 3M fund, these systems must file by July 31, 2026. Phase 2 systems can file a single claim form against both the Dupont and 3M funds for treatment of PFAS in their systems.

The settlements also include an ambiguous provision seeming to require systems to file their claims within 45 days after they detect PFAS—except in extraordinary circumstances, though exactly what this means is unclear. More details about the 3M settlement can be found here and info and forms for the Dupont settlement are here. Utility officials should be aware that there are some firms trying to sign up clients that are not well informed about the settlements; utilities should check the settlement website and ensure that whatever firm they hire to help is knowledgeable about the settlement’s details.

PFAS are a class of more than 14,000 man-made chemicals and are linked to a wide range of health risks, including cancer (kidney and testicular), liver and thyroid problems, immune system suppression, and abnormal fetal development. The vast majority of water systems in U.S. states have been contaminated with PFAS. The contamination comes from several sources, like the industrial or government dumping of PFAS-laden wastewater directly into rivers, lakes, and streams (which is still often legal) or the seeping of PFAS into groundwater from industrial, military, and commercial facilities, airports, or landfills. And this pollution is often even more intense in already overburdened environmental justice communities, according to the NRDC report Dirty Water.

The EPA has known for decades that PFAS endanger human health. After extensive advocacy from environmental and public health advocates, in 2024, the EPA decided to regulate six toxic PFAS chemicals commonly found in drinking water for the first time. Unfortunately, organizations representing the chemical industry and water utilities, like the American Water Works Association, filed lawsuits challenging these new PFAS limits in drinking water.

Subsequently, the Trump administration’s EPA announced that it will abandon its previous defense of its determinations to regulate four of the six PFAS chemicals, along with the tap water limits on those four PFAS chemicals. The agency also said that it would extend the deadline for compliance with the remaining two PFAS tap water standards by two years, until 2031. NRDC, Earthjustice, and impacted community partners have intervened in that case to preserve these valuable health protections.

PFAS contamination is dangerous to our health and our communities. Drinking water is a major source of PFAS exposure, especially in highly impacted communities.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/dupont-chemical-plant-pickaway-county-ohio.jpg?h=e6e78363&itok=MIqTjQPf,N,,2025-11-17 11:08:30.350218

The fleet is powered by 14 Zerova 60kW chargers, providing flexible charging capacity to meet route demands and support future fleet growth.

Funding for the initiative includes nearly $5 million from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program and additional incentives from ComEd, which provided $450,000 in vehicle rebates and approximately $480,000 in make-ready support to prepare charging infrastructure.

""West Aurora is proud to strengthen our commitment to our schools and community by adding electric buses to our sustainability efforts,"" said Dr. Angie Smith, SD129 Associate Superintendent of Operations. ""We continue to work to find ways to provide a healthier environment for our students and families, while also achieving savings for our taxpayers. We hope to be able to demonstrate to other districts that electrification of even a portion of your fleet can make a difference that we can all benefit from.""

Project partners include Central States Bus Sales, which supplied the Blue Bird buses; ComEd, the district's utility partner, in addition to providing financial support; and Grand Kahn Electric, which led installation of the charging equipment.

""ComEd is proud to fund electrification projects like West Aurora School District 129's and hundreds of others across the region as our customers and communities take steps toward a lower carbon future,"" said Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd. ""EV rebates are helping reduce the upfront costs while also bringing us closer to achieving the state's energy and climate goals.""

""West Aurora's leadership is evident across everything they do, from energy efficiency to waste reduction and now transportation,"" said Joshua Williams, Senior Midwestern Regional Manager at Highland Electric Fleets. ""They're showing what it looks like when a district turns long-term commitments into measurable progress for students and the community.""

A ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the launch will take place at 10:30 am on 11/17/25 at 220 Alder Dr., North Aurora, IL 60542. Media and community members are invited to attend.

Why does DIA think it needs to look beyond Xcel Energy?
As for the buffet, it was part of DIA's outreach after an abortive effort last summer to solicit bids about potential nuclear energy at the airport.
Last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency reported that $15 billion in public and private financing has been invested in the technology.
""And, of course, we're working with Xcel Energy to install some other things as well,"" he said.","Denver International Airport, which proclaims itself the largest economic hub west of the Mississippi River, has begun investigating whether it can generate its own electricity to meet accelerating needs in the next 20 years.

In doing so, it would lessen or conceivably end dependence on Xcel Energy, its current supplier.

In January, the airport plans to formally post a request for information. It hopes to get proposals for everything from nuclear to geothermal to solar to -- well, that is the purpose of this request. The airport, which is owned by the City of Denver, wants to gather ideas, including new ones.

The airport now uses 45 megawatts of electricity, but it sees potential need for 300 to 400 megawatts of electrical generation.

This projected need for 300 to 400 megawatts compares with the peak demand of 295 megawatts of Holy Cross Energy, which provides electricity for the Vail and Aspen areas. Platte River Power Authority has peak demand of 707 megawatts from its four member municipalities along the northern Front Range. Those four cities have a combined population of about 360,000 people.

Projected passenger numbers provide one measure of expanded needs. The airport was designed for 50 million annual passengers but in 2024 accommodated 82.3 million. It expects 120 million passengers by 2045, when the airport will celebrate a half-century of operations.

Other components of air traffic -- most immediately air taxis that use the airport -- will want more electricity, likely in the next decade. Air cargo will also expand.

At a community meeting on Nov. 5, Phil Washington, the chief executive, also said that DIA is working with a financial firm to help determine how sites within the airport complex can be developed with ""horizontal infrastructure,"" meaning water and sewer, fiber and other necessities. That includes electricity.

DIA is currently focused on developing 1,500 acres, primarily along Peña Boulevard. This is among 16,000-plus acres of non-aviation land available for compatible commercial development. Data centers have also been mentioned as a possibility.

Vehicle electrification is part of broad market trend, but this also fits in with Denver's aspirations: it aims to be carbon-neutral in energy by 2040. DIA aims to be the greenest airport in the world.

Denver's green ambitions would seem to rule out new natural gas plants, as were deployed by the Pittsburg airport in 2021 in an effort to create greater self-sufficiency. In theory, carbon capture and sequestration could be used with natural gas generation. In practice, the economics remain daunting.

Why does DIA think it needs to look beyond Xcel Energy? Phil Washington, the chief executive, explained the reasoning somewhat obliquely at a community outreach meeting on Nov. 5.

""We're thinking about energy capacity because we feel like ... we are concerned that we are building at a rate where supply will be an issue.""

This, Washington took pains to say, is ""no knock on any specific or particular energy provider; we love them all -- but we love the one that we know best."" The one that it would know best is presumably the one it controls.

Later, after several more assertions about supply worries, the Q&A part of the meeting arrived. I asked what seemed to me to be an elephant-sized question in the room:

""What is the evidence that your current provider will be unable to provide the power you need?"" I asked.

""I don't have any evidence,"" Washington replied. ""We have been working with Xcel Energy. So I don't have any evidence. We're doing this because we want to be sure that we have power. That's the only answer I can give.""

The meeting, the third in the outreach series, was held at the Westin hotel adjacent to the airport terminal. A buffet was part of the evening. The hotel's green chili was excellent, but I also decided a sandwich was in order. I wasn't wearing glasses. What I thought was going to be a ""roast beef sandwich"" turned out to be, once I had sat down at my seat, a ""red beet sandwich.""

That was a first for me.

As for the buffet, it was part of DIA's outreach after an abortive effort last summer to solicit bids about potential nuclear energy at the airport.

DIA announced in August that it planned to spend $1.25 million for a study that would examine the potential to build a small modular reactor somewhere on the airport's property. It has 53 square miles, the second most of any airport in the world.

""Denver leads with bold ideas, and our vision for the future of our airport is no exception,"" said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston in the news release posted on Aug. 6.

""SMRs are gaining traction as a clean energy source for their potential to offer a safe, more scalable and potentially cost-effective approach to generating nuclear power,"" the announcement added. It went on to explain that nuclear could provide 24/7 baseload generation to complement renewable energy.

This announcement produced pushback from a Denver City Council member, and two weeks later the airport quietly shelved the proposed study.

The technology has momentum. Last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency reported that $15 billion in public and private financing has been invested in the technology. Around the world, 74 designs are being pursued. Renewables have very strong legs, but something more -- storage technologies or firm baseload -- is needed.

In July, Canary Media explained the attraction to this technology: ""With SMRs, the thinking goes, relatively smaller plants can be plopped down wherever energy is needed in the world, with factory-fabricated components used to cut down on supply chain and construction costs.""

But, after 50 years of development, the world currently has only two SMRs, one in China and the other in Russia. The Chinese, however, may be bending the cost curve.

Bryan Hannegan, the chief executive of Holy Cross Energy, told a forum on Tuesday evening that he's open to nuclear.

""We've been running small modular reactors in our Navy all around the world for decades with nary a mishap, at least one that we know of,"" he told the Empower Hour, a monthly session sponsored by the Boulder-based Empower Our Future.

""There's every reason to think that it should be something that's possible. And yet, every time we try to build a new nuclear reactor, whether it's a large one like Vogel, or a small one like the one that was planned at the Idaho National Lab, the costs get out of control, the timeline slips.""

Hannegan said that costs rise and then utilities escape. That is what happened at NuScale's small modular reactor project at Idaho National Laboratory in 2023. NuScale raised the target price for power from the SMR to $89 per megawatt-hour from $58. The Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems then pulled out.

""This is one where I'm not really willing to stick my neck out and be the first adopter. That being said, there's perhaps a spot in the portfolio at some point if the community wants it, and that's a big if.""

In putting out the RFP for small modular reactors, DIA last summer got out in front of its skis. Now it is doing what it should have done last summer, asking for many ideas about many technologies, not just one.

""We're asking the private sector to think out of the box,"" said Washington at the DIA forum. ""We're not limiting them. So this will include small modular reactors, or nuclear. This will include hydrogen, geothermal, wind -- all of those things we're asking, ""Give us proposed solutions'.""

Unmentioned was the fact that the City of Denver is currently renegotiating its franchise agreement with Xcel Energy. It's not clear whether that fact plays into this request.

What this amounts to, though, is the prospective creation of something resembling a new utility. Washington acknowledged that the airport might be able to sell the electricity to others.

""If we are energy independent as an airport, if we are our own power company, we can then sell excess power to development to create a new revenue stream,"" said Washington. ""That is not the sole reason we're doing all of this, but that is a residual benefit if we are power independent.""

""Considering the complex energy demands of airports and the surging adoption of electric vehicle technology, the need for airports to decrease reliance on the aging US power grid is significant,"" said two researchers in a January 2025 article called ""Airport Electrification"" that was published in the Journal of Aviation Technology and Engineering.

Energy resilience has emerged as a major concern at airports. This concern is triggered, at least in part, by extended electrical outages. Delta estimated that an 11-hour outage caused by an electrical fire at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport in 2017 cost up to $50 million. Schedules of 30,000 travelers were disrupted.

The Government Accountability Office in 2023 identified 321 outages that lasted at least five minutes at two-dozen U.S. airports from 2015 to 2022.

As the New York Times noted in March, DIA has two dedicated substations, each of which can power the whole facility, providing redundancy in an emergency. It also has two backup generators.

Resilience -- making sure the lights are on -- has been a major driver, but as the CEO of the Pittsburg airport told a New York Times reporter in early 2025, that airport's investment in natural gas and solar had saved the airport $1 million annually.

""The traditional energy infrastructure airport operators have relied on for the past half-century may not be able to keep pace with ballooning power requirements,"" said Juan Macias, the CEO of AlphaStruxure, in a February 2024 posting at Cipher. ""For many airports, it's time to think outside the grid.""

What DIA plans could be called a microgrid. Many hospitals and university campuses have them. They are electrical networks that can operate within the context of the larger electrical grid but with enough generating capacity to operate when outside electrical supplies are unavailable.

DIA already self-generates electricity. The 11 solar arrays at the airport can together produce 50 megawatts of electricity. It also has the largest energy performance contract in Colorado, said Washington. And it is also taking measures to save water. ""And, of course, we're working with Xcel Energy to install some other things as well,"" he said.

""We're concerned that the supply of power and energy may not be available at the pace that we're building now,"" said Washington.

Respondents to DIA's request for information will be asked to consider physical requirements of the generating capacity, the site requirements, the impacts, the operations, and the security. This RFI is to be posted by January, with a deadline of April, then an unspecified number of months for evaluation and then more community input.

""We will then determine what is the best path forward for the alternative energy options for this airport,"" said Washington. ""We're not limited to any energy source.""

Washington has a way of speaking that is at once folksy and forceful. At the meeting, he commented on food compared to the burritos served at a previous community outreach meeting.

""They were okay, but they were like, gut busters,"" he said. ""This is the good stuff.""

It's not hard to imagine him being in the military, and he was. Growing up on the South Side of Chicago, he was expelled from high school. That prompted him to join the U.S. Army, and there he did well at Camp Carson, near Colorado Springs.

In 2000, Washington joined metropolitan Denver's RTD as assistant manager, becoming general manager in 2009. RTD then was building the FasTracks expansion of commuter rail. In 2015, Washington left to manage the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority for six years before returning to Denver in 2021 to run DIA.

DIA certainly has a powerful economic wake. The airport credits itself as spawning $47 billion annually in economic activity. ""We're the largest economic hub west of the Mississippi right now,"" said Washington.

Traffic at DIA is down, but Washington assured his listeners that it is temporary. ""I haven't seen too many Canadians come down lately, but they will be back. The numbers will rebound.""

That will include more international flights. DIA has added flights to Dublin, Rome, and Istanbul in the last few years, and Washington reported being ""very close to a flight"" to Africa.

In what Washington called the ""near term,"" DIA expects to have 50 new gates located within what he called ""walkable complexes"" as it looks toward accommodating 120 million passengers annually. ""And all this will take power and electricity.""

Outside the terminal itself, DIA plans a consolidated rent-a-car facility with a capacity for between 15,000 and 17,000 spaces. Current capacity is 12,760. The complex will have more cars but also EV chargers and other new electrical needs that collectively will require 40 megawatts. Again, the comparison is to DIA's existing overall use of 45 megawatts.

New transportation connecting the terminal with this facility will require electricity. The airport currently has 250,000 annual trips of buses shuttling passengers between rental cars and the terminal.

Changes to the often-congested Pena Boulevard are planned. A north entrance to DIA remains a possibility. Work is underway for a new $500 million baggage-handling system.

Currently 40,000 people work at DIA. In the expansions now planned, said Washington, the airport will have around 60,000 employees.

But again, why is DIA now thinking it needs to provide self-generation? In the Q&A, Washington got a question that mentioned Coca-Cola.

A 570,000-square foot aluminum and plastic bottling plant near DIA had been planned since at least 2023. The company announced in August that it was going elsewhere in Colorado. In part, it said, it was doing so because Xcel Energy had failed to supply electricity to the site, according to City of Denver documents and a city council member cited by The Denver Post.

""Xcel Energy and Denver International Airport could not figure out a time-efficient manner to get Coca-Cola power to build out there, and then they all started pointing fingers at each other,"" Stacie Gilmore, the council member, told the newspaper. Xcel pointed to lack of commitment by the bottling company.

Others have complained about the slowness of Xcel to deliver electricity. In February, the Post reported that real estate developer Brightland Homes sued Xcel, claiming that service and installation delays of Xcel in metropolitan Denver had caused the builder lost sales.

As for DIA, most of us use that name. Washington and others call it DEN, the airport code in international traffic. In that international lexicon, DIA had already been appropriated for an airport in Qatar before DIA debuted in 1995.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c4a9562/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2665x1399+168+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb2%2F76%2Fcb3659ac4cb7be32d865b53e4d3e%2Fap110714046650.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 11:08:01.345036

“People have this techno-utopian view of AI that it will save us from the climate crisis,” said Jean Su, a climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We know what will save us from the climate crisis – phasing out fossil fuels.
“Overall we are very, very far from a situation where AI for good balances out the negative environmental impact of AI.
“The environmental cost of AI is already alarming and I don’t see data center growth winding down any time soon.","Artificial intelligence is often associated with ludicrous amounts of electricity, and therefore planet-heating emissions, expended to create nonsensical or misleading slop that is of meagre value to humanity.

Some AI advocates at a major UN climate summit are posing an alternative view, though – what if AI could help us solve, rather than worsen, the climate crisis?

The “AI for good” argument has been made repeatedly at the Cop30 talks in Belém, Brazil, with supporters arguing AI can be used to lower, rather than raise, emissions through a series of efficiencies that can spread through areas of our lives such as food, transport and energy that cause much of the pollution dangerously heating our planet.

Last week, a coalition of groups, UN bodies and the Brazilian government unveiled the AI Climate Institute, a new global initiative aimed at fostering AI “as a tool of empowerment” in developing countries to help them tackle environmental problems.

Proponents say the program, in time, will help educate countries on how to use AI in an array of ways to bring down emissions, such as better optimizing public transit, organizing agricultural systems and recalibrating the energy grid so that renewables are deployed at the right times.

Even weather forecasting, including the mapping of impending climate-driven disasters such as flooding and wildfires, can be improved in this way, according to Maria João Sousa, executive director, Climate Change AI, one of the groups behind the new initiative.

“Very few places in the world actually run numerical weather prediction models because numerical weather prediction models are very compute-intensive,” she said. “I definitely believe (AI) is a positive force to accelerate a lot of these things.”

AI can help monitor emissions, biodiversity and generally see what is going on, said Lorenzo Saa, chief sustainability officer at Clarity AI, who is also attending Cop30.

“You can really start looking at where the problem is,” he said. “Then you can predict, and the prediction is actually short-term and long-term. You can now predict floods in the next week, but you can actually figure out sea level rise and things like that.”

Saa admitted there are legitimate concerns about the governance of AI and its impact upon society but, on balance, the effect on the environment could be positive. In June, a report by the London School of Economics had an unexpectedly sunny estimate – AI could reduce global greenhouse gases by 3.2bn to 5.4bn tonnes in the next decade, even factoring in its vast energy consumption.

“People already make dumb decisions about energy, such as running air conditioning for too long,” Saa said. “How much of our phone has bad stuff for us? I think a lot. How many hours do we spend on Instagram?

“My view of this is that society is going to go in this direction. We need to think about how we are not destroying the planet with heating and we’re actually trying to make sure that there’s a net benefit.”

Some other experts and environmental advocates are not convinced. The huge computational power of AI, particularly generative AI, is fueling a boom in data centers in countries such as the US that is gobbling up a huge amount of electricity and water, even in places prone to droughts, pushing up electricity bills in some places as a result.

The climate cost of this AI gold rush, driven by companies such as Google, Meta and OpenAI, is large and set to get larger – a recent Cornell University study found that by 2030, the current rate of AI growth in the US will add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the equivalent of adding 10m gasoline cars to the road or the entire annual emissions of Norway.

“People have this techno-utopian view of AI that it will save us from the climate crisis,” said Jean Su, a climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “We know what will save us from the climate crisis – phasing out fossil fuels. It’s not AI.”

Also, while AI can be used to drive efficiencies to lower emissions, the same sort of tools can be used to optimize other areas – including fossil fuel production. A report last month by Wood Mackenzie estimated that AI could help unlock an extra trillion barrels of oil – a scenario which, if the energy markets were to be amenable to such a thing, would obliterate any hopes of restraining catastrophic climate breakdown.

Natascha Hospedales, lead lawyer for AI at Client Earth, said there is some merit to the “AI for good” argument, but that it is a “really small niche” within a much larger industry that is much more focused on maximizing profits.

“There is some truth that AI could help the developing world, but much of this is in the early stage and some of it is hypothetical – it’s just not there yet,” she said. “Overall we are very, very far from a situation where AI for good balances out the negative environmental impact of AI.

“The environmental cost of AI is already alarming and I don’t see data center growth winding down any time soon. A small percentage of AI is used for good and 99% of it is companies like Google and Meta lining their pockets with money, damaging the environment and human rights as they do it.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd20b2ca286178d3ada81c6fa78de0d77a069fe/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02798ea6f7ae381d18ffa027d39426ea",N,,2025-11-17 13:02:35.904057

SOURCE Verra Mobility","Poll found more than 75% of Americans are in favor of road usage charging – having a positive or neutral view of the concept

MESA, Ariz., Nov. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Verra Mobility Corporation (NASDAQ: VRRM), a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, announced today the results of a new survey of 2,000 Americans who regularly use toll roads.

The survey examined Americans' perceptions of the various programs that fund roads and infrastructure.

The survey results can be downloaded by visiting www.verramobility.com/survey-ruc-road-usage-charging-toll-roads.

One of the main sources of funds to improve roads and bridges in the U.S. since 1932 has been the federal gas tax, which currently adds 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. Since the rise in electric vehicle (EV) sales, the gas tax revenue has been slowly declining. For example, in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Petroleum Association reported an estimated drop in state gas tax revenue of $250 million when comparing 2024 to 2019.

The survey found:

Americans believe that roads are in need of improvements, with 93% of survey respondents stating that the infrastructure in their state needs to be improved.

When asked what they believed was the best way to recoup these funds, 73% of Americans answered that EV owners should have to pay an 'energy tax'.

""The U.S. is experiencing a fundamental shift in how we fund infrastructure improvements and expansions,"" said Stacey Moser, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Verra Mobility's Commercial Services business. ""Toll roads, and more recently, initiatives like New York City's congestion pricing program, have demonstrated that user-based funding models can be highly effective. These models generate reliable revenue but also offer drivers faster, safer and more reliable travel.""

One alternative is toll roads, which are currently utilized in many U.S. states. The U.S. tolling market was valued at approximately $12.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $18.6 billion by 2030.

The study asked several questions on Americans' perceptions of toll roads, finding that:

67% of respondents said they believed toll roads were fairer than taxes

76% believed paying tolls is acceptable if the revenue is being used to improve the quality and safety of roads and bridges

72% believe everyone should pay the same for toll roads

75% believe that tolls should be the same regardless of time of day

65% said they would be more willing to pay tolls if they knew revenue was dedicated to infrastructure projects that directly benefited them

67% believe tolls should go away once a project is paid for

When asked directly if they were generally in favor of toll roads as a way to fund transportation projects, 51% were in favor, 30% were neutral and 20% were against. These numbers were slightly more favorable than when asked about other road use pricing models:

41% were in favor of road usage charging, with 33% being neutral and 25% against

41% were in favor of congestion pricing, with 31% being neutral and 28% against

""This evolution will have a significant impact on drivers and, even more so, on fleet operators, who must navigate a complex network of tolling authorities and payment schemes while staying compliant,"" continued Moser. ""As one of the largest payers of tolls in the country, Verra Mobility has a unique perspective on how these programs are rolled out and scaled. With many new funding models now emerging to address the decline in traditional gas tax revenues, we wanted to better understand how Americans view these changes, and this survey provides important insight into public sentiment.""

For more than 15 years, Verra Mobility has helped fleet owners and operators manage toll payments quickly and easily. Each year, the company processes over 300 million tolls and violations for more than seven million vehicles worldwide. By automatically paying tolls and preventing costly fines, Verra Mobility helps drivers stay on the move while saving businesses time and money.

“Industrial beef production emits vast amounts of greenhouse gases from every stage of the operation.
And now, it’s pulling down its climate claims,” said Eberly.
EWG’s complaint alleged it is currently impossible for Tyson to cut enteric emissions without eliminating the cattle themselves, making the “net-zero” or “climate-smart” claims misleading.","WASHINGTON – The Environmental Working Group has reached a settlement in its lawsuit alleging that Tyson Foods’ promises to reach “net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and sell “climate-smart” beef were not backed by sufficient actions to make those goals credible.

Under the settlement, Tyson will refrain from making these environmental claims for five years and cannot introduce new related claims unless they are supported by expert analysis and verified facts. The settlement was filed today in D.C. Superior Court.

It follows a separate settlement reached on November 10 between the New York attorney general’s office and JBS USA, the giant meat producer, which also agreed to stop making unsubstantiated claims about reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

JBS and Tyson together produce about 50% of the beef consumed in the United States. The settlements represent a positive step in efforts to protect consumers from false and misleading statements made by major beef corporations.

EWG is represented by Animal Legal Defense Fund(link is external), or ALDF, Earthjustice(link is external), Edelson PC(link is external) and FarmSTAND(link is external) in the suit filed under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act. Filed in September 2024, the suit accused Tyson of making “false or misleading” marketing claims targeting D.C. consumers concerned about climate change.

“This settlement reinforces the principle that consumers deserve honesty and accountability from the corporations shaping our food system,” said Caroline Leary, general counsel and chief operating officer at EWG. “The outcome makes clear that corporate climate pledges must be transparent, verifiable and rooted in real change.”

Significant victory

“This settlement is a significant milestone for advocates and consumers who demand honesty in climate-related marketing,” said Amanda Howell, Managing Attorney at ALDF.

“Tyson Foods, the second largest meat company in the world, has agreed to stop making climate and emissions claims unless those claims are substantiated by a third-party expert using credible science and an actual, achievable plan,” she added.

“ALDF will continue working to ensure that consumers who care about the climate crisis, sustainability, and the harmful environmental impacts of animal agriculture have access to truthful and non-misleading information,” said Howell.

“This settlement should be a clear signal to consumers to be cautious of major beef producers’ marketing their products as ‘climate-smart,’” said Carrie Apfel, Deputy Managing Attorney of Earthjustice’s Sustainable Food and Farming program.

“Industrial beef production emits vast amounts of greenhouse gases from every stage of the operation. Achieving meaningful emission reductions at this industrial scale would require corporations to make transparent, transformative changes — which we allege Tyson hasn’t shown,” said Apfel.

“Today’s resolution marks a crucial turning point in the fight against climate greenwashing,” said Kelsey Eberly, Senior Staff Attorney at FarmSTAND.

“Tyson Foods is the second-largest meat and poultry producer in the world, controls a fifth of the country’s beef, pork, and chicken — and has been estimated to produce nearly as much methane pollution as major oil companies. And now, it’s pulling down its climate claims,” said Eberly.

“With climate-forward policies weathering existential attacks, legal actions like this are increasingly critical to raise consumer awareness about the outsized impact conglomerates like Tyson have on our climate,” added Eberly.

Beef production’s climate impacts

Industrialized meat production generates tremendous volumes of climate-warming emissions at every stage of the process, from deforestation and overgrazing to feed production, and from cattle enteric and manure emissions to slaughter and distribution.

Tyson’s greenhouse gas emissions alone exceed those of Austria or Greece(link is external). Its beef production is responsible for 85% of the company’s emissions.

In 2022, enteric fermentation from beef cattle – their natural digestion process – accounted for about 18% of total U.S. methane emissions. Methane acts as a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential more than 80 times that of carbon dioxide over 20 years.

Manure management also contributes to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions(link is external). And through the use of fertilizers, feed production for beef cattle releases additional nitrous oxide, which has a global warming potential nearly 300 times that of carbon dioxide.

Deforestation and degradation of land for beef cattle production globally release carbon dioxide and also incur a carbon opportunity cost by precluding additional sequestration that would occur under alternative land use scenarios.

EWG’s lawsuit allegations

In its complaint, EWG alleged that studies show methane and nitrous oxide emitted by Tyson’s intensive beef production cannot be eliminated with existing or anticipated technology. EWG’s complaint alleged it is currently impossible for Tyson to cut enteric emissions without eliminating the cattle themselves, making the “net-zero” or “climate-smart” claims misleading.

Industrially produced meat contributes significantly to climate emissions, and beef such as Tyson’s contributes far greater emissions(link is external) than all other major food products.

Consumers increasingly seek products that are better for the planet. EWG’s complaint noted Tyson’s recognition that “a growing number of consumers are willing to pay a premium to eat beef and other foods with lower GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions,” that “[c]onsumers would be willing to pay at least 24% more for environmentally friendly sustainable options in retail,” and that “[i]ncreasing concern over climate change also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences.”

In an intentional effort to capitalize on consumer preferences for sustainable options, Tyson repeatedly told consumers on its website and in news releases over nearly four and a half years that it was committing to achieving “net-zero” emissions by 2050, and that it “sells climate-smart beef.”

As the lawsuit alleged, despite the enormous scale of Tyson’s industrial production and its GHG emissions, the company has taken little action toward achieving these commitments. It has fallen far short of offering anything close to substantiation for these claims, the suit alleged.

Rather, the complaint maintained, Tyson has spent less than 0.1% of its revenue on efforts to reduce its climate impact, mostly on research – $50 million dollars out of a total annual revenue of roughly $53 billion. Tyson spends about three times as much on advertising(link is external) as it does on research.

Ministers say the UK is using its diplomatic and industrial reach to shape the next phase of global clean power growth.","The UK is pitching itself as the driving force behind a new global clean power revolution as world leaders signed up to a major supply chains mission unveiled at COP30.

Ministers say the move will unlock the materials, data and manufacturing muscle needed to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030.

Australia, Canada, Kenya, the Netherlands, the UK and Zambia have joined the Global Clean Power Alliance Supply Chains Mission.

The initiative is backed by the European Commission and the COP30 Presidency and is designed to tear down the barriers that are slowing the energy transition across both rich and poorer nations.

Downing Street says the mission is the next stage of the UK’s strategy to lead global clean power deployment.

The Prime Minister launched the Global Clean Power Alliance at the G20 Summit in 2024 and confirmed the supply chains expansion at the IEA Future of Energy Security Summit in April 2025.

The mission has one clear aim. Build resilient clean power supply chains fast enough to match the pace of the transition.

Leaders warn that without coordinated supply chains the world will not meet the Global Stocktake pledge to triple renewables by 2030. They say the transition is “the transformational opportunity of our time” and that stable supply chains are now central to global energy security.

The mission is built around four pillars. Each one targets a weakness slowing the rollout of clean power.

The first tackles data.

Governments say the lack of transparency is crippling effective policymaking and holding back investment so the mission will work with the IEA to create reliable global supply chain data.

The second targets grid equipment.

Bottlenecks in transformers, switchgear and key components are stretching project timelines so countries will harmonise standards, attract investment and expand manufacturing to cut delays.

The third pillar pushes circularity.

The mission says recycling markets are blocked by clashing regulations and no global standards so partners will unlock cross-border flows of recycled materials and reduce pressure on primary minerals.

The fourth pillar focuses on emerging markets.

Leaders say too many resource-rich nations are shut out of clean power value chains so the mission will help derisk finance, expand skills and secure better economic participation.

The UK says the mission is grounded in partnership between the Global North and Global South. Governments and industry will work together to design practical solutions that share the economic benefits of the transition.

International bodies will be plugged in from day one. The mission will work with the IEA, UNEZA, IRENA and the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions as technical partners.

Storage facilities—like peak shaving facilities, underground gas storage facilities, and petroleum product terminals—have more than 6 million nearby residents.
Almost 90% of the population near end-use, transportation, refining, and storage infrastructure is found in urban areas.
This indicates that while there are more pieces of extraction infrastructure across the country, they are generally located in less populated spots.
By identifying communities already hosting significant amounts of fossil fuel infrastructure, the researchers say their work can help guide more equitable siting of energy infrastructure in the future.","Fossil fuels release pollutants into the air when extracted and burned, but there’s more to their production than massive oil rigs diving deep into the Earth and smoky power plants. Those processes are examples of only the first and last—and generally most visible—moments in a fossil fuel’s five-stage journey.

Between the initial extraction site and the final power-generating facility, oil and gas are also refined to remove impurities, held in storage facilities, and transported from place to place. These mid-supply chain steps occur in a sprawling fossil fuel infrastructure network that spans the United States and is often hidden from plain sight.

A new study by Boston University researchers offers a first-time look at populations living within 1.6 km (roughly a mile) of fossil fuel infrastructure across all stages of the supply chain. Published in Environmental Research Letters, the study estimates that 46.6 million people in the contiguous US live within about a mile of at least one piece of fossil fuel infrastructure. This represents 14.1% of the population.

While a growing body of research confirms that communities residing near extraction and end-use facilities face a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes and asthma—and research on other health outcomes, including leukemia, is emerging—much less is known about the health effects of living near mid-supply chain infrastructure. Harmful pollutants such as volatile organic compounds have been detected near some of these facilities.

“This study helps us get a general size of the potential problem, and really starts the process of doing a better job of understanding exactly what the hazards are and how many people are potentially exposed,” said Jonathan Buonocore, the paper’s first author, an assistant professor of environmental health at BU’s School of Public Health (SPH), and core faculty at BU's Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS). “Especially for these more obscure pieces of energy infrastructure, this is the first step to tracking what emissions and stressors those are imposing on the communities.”

Breaking down that 46.6 million figure, the team estimated how many people live near each type of infrastructure nationwide. Almost 21 million Americans live near end-use facilities, including power plants. More than 20 million are within a mile of extraction sites, like oil and gas wells. Storage facilities—like peak shaving facilities, underground gas storage facilities, and petroleum product terminals—have more than 6 million nearby residents. Fewer people live near refining and transportation. Many Americans, about 9 million, are counted toward several of those totals, as their homes are in proximity to multiple types of infrastructure.

“There is reason to believe that there could be air pollution coming from each of these stages, from consistent pollution, gas leaks, or blowouts, when gas or oil flows from a well uncontrollably,” said Mary Willis, the study’s senior author, an assistant professor of epidemiology at SPH, and core faculty at IGS. “All of these stages can reasonably impact a range of population health outcomes, yet the basic information of who is even near the infrastructure components has not been examined to date.”

Identifying Inequities in Fossil Fuel Exposure

According to the study, infrastructure is not distributed evenly across the nation. Predominantly non-white groups are disproportionately exposed across all stages of the energy supply chain, a finding that aligns with previous research and indicates an environmental injustice.

Urbanites are also more exposed than their rural counterparts. Almost 90% of the population near end-use, transportation, refining, and storage infrastructure is found in urban areas.

Examining each infrastructure type helped the researchers reveal important trends that could guide policymaking. For instance, they found that a single piece of storage infrastructure has, on average, 2,900 residents within a mile, while a single piece of extraction infrastructure has an average of only 17 nearby inhabitants. This indicates that while there are more pieces of extraction infrastructure across the country, they are generally located in less populated spots. Pieces of storage infrastructure are less plentiful, but more likely to be found in dense urban areas.

“That means that if a local policymaker in an urban area were to take interest in reducing exposures, they may receive the most impact per piece of infrastructure if they focus on storage,” Buonocore said.

By identifying communities already hosting significant amounts of fossil fuel infrastructure, the researchers say their work can help guide more equitable siting of energy infrastructure in the future.

New Results Made Possible by First-of-its-Kind Database

The publication marks the first study based on the Energy Infrastructure Exposure Intensity and Equity Indices (EI3) Database for Public Health, launched by Buonocore and Willis in spring 2024 at the Power & People Symposium. Additional co-authors on this article include Fintan Mooney, Erin Campbell, Brian Sousa, Breanna van Loenen, Patricia Fabian, and Amruta Nori-Sarma.

Until EI3’s launch, data on fossil fuel energy infrastructure was scattered across local, state, and national agencies and jurisdictions, sometimes behind paywalls or password protection. With an IGS Sustainability Research Grant jointly funded by IGS and SPH, the team centralized all publicly available information for the first time into a single harmonized national tool. Their dataset is accessible on Harvard Dataverse. This grant also catalyzed the launch of the interdisciplinary SPH Energy and Health Lab, which Buonocore and Willis co-direct.

“The study really shows that there are big knowledge gaps across the supply chain, in terms of the hazards people are being exposed to, the consequent health impacts, and who is being exposed,” Buonocore said. “With a lot of these different types of infrastructure, the hazards have not been fully characterized. Characterizing hazards and understanding who is most heavily exposed should be the first steps of understanding the possible health impacts. This research takes the first steps down that path.”

A Clearer Picture Opens New Directions for Future Research

While some US municipalities or states have set zoning regulations, in many regions, fossil fuel processes are permitted in any proximity to homes and schools. The team hopes their work will spur continued research to inform policymaking and promote community health. They note that future research may aim to better monitor air, water, noise, and light pollution near facilities, and expand on potential health impacts into novel datasets, such as Medicaid claims, or unique populations like pregnancy planners.

“We're really the first group thinking about this as an integrated system. By quantifying all of these factors at once, we're potentially able to, down the line, directly compare: what are the health effects of living near an extraction site, compared to living near a storage site?” Willis said. “Having that in one database is the first step to doing any health studies in the future on this integrated system.”",https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert-bluebg_Twitter_601X601.png,N,,2025-11-17 12:01:28.078867

By making clean energy the foundation for job creation and economic opportunity, we can turn today’s milestones into a future where clean power drives growth and ensures prosperity for all.","This year marks a historic milestone: for the first time, global renewable-energy production has surpassed coal.

In the first half of 2025, renewables accounted for more than 34% of the world’s electricity, while coal’s share fell to just above 33%. Notably, these gains were largely driven by emerging economies.

As the world’s attention turns to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), this milestone serves as a powerful reminder that the clean-energy transition is already underway.

Having led investments at the US International Development Finance Corporation and now serving as chief investment officer at the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, I know a promising business opportunity when I see one.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 91% of new renewable-energy projects are now cheaper than their fossil-fuel counterparts.

This finding provides clear evidence that, despite the ongoing growth in coal and oil use, renewables are both economically and technically viable throughout much of the world.

We cannot afford to let today’s momentum slip away.

To reduce climate pollution, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen energy resilience where it is needed most, we must build on these achievements.

As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, meaningful global climate action is still possible, even in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions and competing national priorities.

Progress is inherently fragile

Yet such progress is inherently fragile. All too often, clean-energy adoption stalls once the infrastructure is in place.

Solar projects, for example, can fail when communities lack the necessary tools and financing to make full use of the electricity they produce.

Providing solar panels is not enough

Providing solar panels is not enough. To lock in the benefits of renewables, governments must invest not only in power generation but also in systems, training, and equipment – such as electric mills and water pumps – that enable communities and countries to harness clean energy for business growth and job creation.

When implemented effectively, such investments deliver benefits across the board. Climate goals advance as renewables replace costly, polluting fuels.

Communities gain access to affordable power, enabling them to improve education and health care, create jobs, and raise incomes.

And with energy companies profiting from rising demand, emerging economies can attract new investment.

The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity

The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity. The World Bank projects that 1.2 billion young people in developing economies will reach working age over the next decade, but that only 420 million new jobs will be created by then.

Access to clean energy, and the opportunities it brings, offers a way to bridge this gap before it becomes a global crisis.

The World Economic Forum estimates that the renewables industry alone could generate more than 30 million jobs and mobilize $2.2-2.8 trillion annually.

Embedding renewable technologies into other downstream sectors such as industry and agriculture could create a further 500 million new jobs and improve the quality of 700 million existing ones.

We must align energy policies with broader development objectives

To succeed, we must align energy policies with broader development objectives, integrate renewables into local industries, and accelerate investment in the equipment and training needed to use it effectively.

Across Africa, this approach is already delivering tangible results. In Nigeria, farmers and traders are increasingly using solar-powered irrigation pumps, cold-storage facilities, and mills.

These investments, in turn, have fueled a wave of distributed renewable-energy projects that are rapidly transforming local power systems.

In the Amazon, where COP30 is underway, the government of Brazil is investing $800 million to expand energy access and transition away from reliance on diesel.

My organization is helping to ensure that this new renewable energy creates jobs and powers sustainable economic development for thousands of farmers and entrepreneurs.

The clean-energy transition is within reach

India offers a useful model for emerging economies seeking to strengthen their power grids and absorb growing renewable capacity. In New Delhi, the country’s first commercial, utility-scale battery-energy storage system – the largest in South Asia – now guarantees a reliable supply of clean electricity to 100,000 low-income households and businesses.

Meanwhile, solar plants in Rajasthan provide steady daytime power to 40,000 farmers.

And in Uttar Pradesh, a women’s entrepreneurship program aims to help 500,000 women-owned businesses adopt clean-energy technologies by 2030.

Together, these examples show that the clean-energy transition is within reach.

But with 685 million people worldwide lacking electricity, and more than a billion relying on unaffordable or unreliable supply, there is still a long way to go.

The choice before us is clear: continue investing in renewables or slide back into fossil-fuel dependence.

As part of an expanded scheme to fund solar panels for NHS sites, military sites and schools, over 250 schools across England have signed agreements to benefit from a share of up to £100 million in funding from Great British Energy and government for new solar panels and other energy efficiency measures.

23 schools have now installed Great British Energy solar panels and are cutting their energy bills, from Notre Dame RC School in Plymouth to Christ The King RC Primary School in Manchester. This has allowed savings to be reinvested in school services as part of the government’s clean energy superpower mission, enabling communities to reap the benefits of homegrown, clean power.

This is part of the government’s drive to make all public buildings more climate resilient. The government is building all new schools to be climate-resilient and net-zero in operation as part of the School Rebuilding Programme.

Rocketing energy bills in recent years have eaten into school budgets. This has been driven by the UK’s dependency on global fossil fuel markets over which government has no control. By enabling schools to generate their own electricity, it is estimated schools will save millions, far more than installation costs.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Great British Energy is helping schools to save money on bills, meaning more money for textbooks and technology.

Across the country, solar panels are going up on rooftops to power classrooms with clean, homegrown power.

This is our clean energy superpower mission in action, protecting our public services with lower bills and energy security.

Great British Energy’s CEO, Dan McGrail said:

Great British Energy’s ongoing solar rollout delivers tangible benefits to the people that need it most in our hospitals and schools.

This not only provides clean energy to communities, it also ensures that the public own and benefit from these projects through energy security, good jobs and above all, real tangible local outcomes such as more funds to support teaching and health.

Education Minister Josh MacAlister said:

Solar panels are slashing schools’ energy bills by thousands of pounds year after year, with the money going straight back into the textbooks and resources pupils need to succeed.

This is part of our wider work to drive national renewal, rebuilding more than 750 schools in every corner of the country.

The scheme will target schools and colleges with buildings that are able to accommodate solar panels in areas of England most in need. As part of this, the government has selected schools that will be primarily clustered in areas of deprivation in the North East, West Midlands and North West, as well as at least 10 schools in each region of England.

Each region includes a further education college which will work with the contractors appointed to promote careers in renewables to support growth in the construction and renewables workforce. This could be through work placements, skills bootcamps and workshops.

This follows the government’s commitment to curriculum reforms which will strengthen climate and sustainability education across geography, science, citizenship, and design and technology – from year one through to a new Natural History GCSE – helping to ensure pupils understand the planet, take action on climate change and develop the skills for a greener future.

This is alongside all nurseries, schools and colleges being called upon to put in place a climate action plan, while empowering young voices through Youth Sustainability Champions to help advise, evaluate and champion sustainability in education.

The rollout of these solar panels marks progress in Great British Energy and government’s Local Power Plan that will ensure the benefits of the government’s clean energy mission are felt at a local level, with energy security, good jobs and economic growth – while also helping to rebuild the nation’s public services.

Mark Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Bellevue Place Education Trust, London said:

We are delighted to have Kilburn Grange School and Halley House School enrolled in the Great British Energy’s solar programme in addition to other Bellevue Place Education Trust schools. Last year, all our schools collectively achieved a 9.4% reduction in energy consumption, saving £299K in energy bills, which we can invest back into the education provision for our pupils.

Nicola Malone, Head Teacher of Christ the King Roman Catholic Primary School, Salford said:

We are very proud that Christ the King is benefitting from the Great British Energy Solar Partnership programme. The solar installation will make a lasting difference for our school, whilst showing our children the value of sustainability and emphasising our shared responsibility for the world around us.

The summit will take place on 26–27 November at the Intercontinental Hotel in Santiago and will feature former energy ministers, current government officials and high-level technical leaders from across the Southern Cone.

The event will be streamed live on the official Future Energy Summit YouTube channel. Among the top-level sessions, particular attention will go to panels co-organized with the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), which will address institutional, regulatory and financial challenges for the region’s energy transition.

On the first day, the closing panel will bring together former Chilean energy ministers Claudio Huepe (in office March–September 2022), Juan Carlos Jobet (June 2019–March 2022), and Carolina Zelaya, former Acting Executive Secretary of the National Energy Commission (CNE).

The discussion — titled “Public Policy Priorities for Chile’s Next Government” — will be moderated by Andrés Rebolledo, current Executive Secretary of OLADE and also a former Chilean energy minister. The session will focus on the strategic steps Chile needs to take to advance toward a cleaner, more resilient energy matrix.

A key contextual element: FES Chile will take place just ten days after the presidential and congressional elections, providing a timely forum to assess the energy proposals of the political groups competing to lead the country from 2026 to 2030.

The second day will revolve around battery energy storage systems (BESS) under the theme #ExperienciaBESS. The program begins with a VIP networking breakfast featuring Luis Felipe Ramos Barrera, Chile’s current Undersecretary of Energy.

Panel 1 — “Energy Strategies of Southern Cone Governments” — will bring together:

Mauricio Bejarano, Vice Minister of Mines and Energy of Paraguay

Agustín González, Energy Efficiency Manager at Uruguay’s National Energy Directorate

Antonio Milanese, Undersecretary for Energy Transition and Planning of Argentina

Moderated once again by OLADE’s Andrés Rebolledo.

The summit coincides with a milestone in Latin America’s energy storage deployment. The region, including the Caribbean, has already surpassed 3 GW of installed storage capacity, driven mainly by electrochemical technologies that account for 60% of the total.

Chile is leading this regional trend with more than 1,800 MW of operational BESS capacity, expected to exceed 2 GW by January 2026, four years ahead of its official 2030 target.

Including projects under construction, Chile’s installed BESS capacity could reach 8.6 GW by 2027, far surpassing the country’s long-term target of 6 GW by 2050.

Energy storage, renewable energy integration, regulatory modernization and investment in clean technologies will be central themes throughout FES Chile — an event positioned as a key platform for technical debate, political analysis and private-sector engagement.

Built on a 1,850-acre site, the factory signals Toyota’s move to scale up hybrid and electric vehicle production in response to market shifts and policy changes.

This investment push comes at a time of significant adjustment within the automotive industry. While fully electric vehicles are seeing a dip in consumer momentum, hybrid demand is surging—especially in the United States, where Toyota holds over half the market share in this segment. The new plant is expected to reinforce that leadership while bolstering domestic production capacity amid a shifting regulatory landscape.

A Milestone for Toyota’s US Operations

The North Carolina plant began production on November 12, 2025, and was described by Toyota Motor North America CEO Ted Ogawa as a “pivotal moment” in the company’s history, according to CNBC. The factory is designed to produce 30 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion batteries annually once fully operational, powering a mix of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric vehicles.

This new facility represents the largest individual manufacturing investment Toyota has made in the United States to date. The company noted that its total cumulative US investment will now approach $60 billion since it began operations in the country nearly 70 years ago.

The site is expected to create up to 5,100 jobs and includes 14 production lines that will supply batteries for models such as the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a future three-row electric SUV.

Aligning With Evolving Mobility Goals

While market enthusiasm for electric-only vehicles has cooled, Toyota’s strategy has stayed focused on diversified electrification. Hybrid vehicle sales in the US are continuing to outpace expectations, and Toyota’s longstanding focus in that area appears to be paying off. The company leads hybrid sales through Q3 2025 with a 51% share, based on data from Motor Intelligence.

The Liberty plant is a direct outcome of US government initiatives to bring more battery production onshore, a priority that gained momentum in recent years. Although the project was first announced back in December 2021, Toyota’s continued investment trajectory suggests a long-term commitment to reshoring its supply chain and mitigating geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainties.

During a press event, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the announcement a “show of confidence” in the current administration’s policies aimed at strengthening domestic manufacturing. Fox Business reported Duffy’s remarks, highlighting the government’s emphasis on creating well-paying industrial jobs and stimulating regional economies through large-scale infrastructure projects like this.

Investing in Workforce and Infrastructure

Beyond the production lines, Toyota is positioning the Liberty site as more than just a factory. The facility will also feature a range of amenities designed to support employees and build community ties—among them, an on-site medical clinic, pharmacy, childcare center, and fitness facility. These additions are part of a broader effort to attract and retain skilled labor in a highly competitive job market.

This human-centered approach to manufacturing was emphasized during Toyota’s public statements, underscoring the company’s efforts to invest not just in technology but in people and local economies. As more production lines are added by 2030, the plant is expected to become a central hub for Toyota’s electric and hybrid vehicle platforms in the region.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toyota-dealership.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 11:09:22.219831

Summary

U.S. energy production and demand are growing, driven by LNG exports, data centers, and grid modernization, with Texas and shale basins supporting growth.

Major utilities are investing more than $1 trillion through 2029 to upgrade grids and support evolving energy mixes.

Large midstream firms are positioned to benefit from expanding export markets, power infrastructure buildouts, and needed pipelines.

Despite the tech sector's dominance, energy remains a foundational and complementary investment area.

I offer some takeaways from a Fed energy conference.

Energy production and consumption is an important feature of the U.S. economy. We're the pace car of the world in some respects. From a Nov. 13 Federal Reserve Bank energy conference in Denver, representing Dallas’ 11th and Kansas City’s 10th districts, a range of takeaways emerged from

The $14 billion plant, located in Liberty, is the first and only Toyota battery plant outside of Japan.
“Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts,” the release says.
“This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.
Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030.","Toyota announced the start of production at its new battery plant in North Carolina Wednesday, along with a commitment to an additional $10 billion U.S. investment, according to a company press release.

The $14 billion plant, located in Liberty, is the first and only Toyota battery plant outside of Japan.

“Building on its unwavering commitment to the U.S., Toyota announced an additional investment of up to $10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility efforts,” the release says. “This will bring the company’s total U.S. investment to nearly $60 billion since beginning operations here nearly 70 years ago.

According to Automotive News, a Toyota spokesperson declined to specify which projects the funds would go toward. The trade publication noted that President Donald Trump announced last month that Toyota was preparing to invest $10 billion in auto plants in the United States.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” said Ted Ogawa, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) president and chief executive officer, said in the release. “Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers.”

U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy is mentioned in the Toyota release as expressing support for the investments, stating that the battery plant marks a turning point for the Piedmont Triad region.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, America is open for business,” said Duffy in the release. “Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!”

Automotive News also reports that Duffy said regulatory relief will be coming to automakers who wrestle with their powertrain strategies, he said.

“I haven’t been able to announce it yet because of the [federal government] shutdown, but on the horizon, we’re going to have an announcement where we’re going to have a very reasonable fuel efficiency standard,” Automotive News said he told an audience at the plant event. “And when we do that, what’s going to happen is you’re going to be able to make more cars, because your cars are going to be more cost-effective for the American consumer. We’re going to bring down the price of vehicles because we don’t have standards that, frankly, you can’t [meet].”

The 1,850-acre site can produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity, the release says. It will serve as the company’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries needed for its portfolio of electric vehicles.

It will house 14 battery production lines supporting HEVs, BEVs and PHEVs. The batteries will power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row BEV. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama, the release says.

Additional production lines at Toyota North Carolina are set to launch by 2030.

Toyota also announced the second phase of its “Driving Possibilities” initiative in Guilford County Schools and the Asheboro City School District with a Toyota USA Foundation grant of an additional $2.7 million.

“This incredible gift will provide our students and their families with life-changing opportunities,” said Wendy Poteat, president and CEO of shift_ed, a nonprofit regional leader connecting education to workforce development, and coordinating partner for the NC Driving Possibilities program. “Toyota has become a generous supporter and dedicated stakeholder in enriching our school districts by inspiring innovation and nurturing curiosity and creativity in our learners from classroom to career. Programs like these are essential in closing opportunity and exposure gaps, empowering students to reach their full potential.”

THE TOP FIVE

1. Trump opens half of an untouched Alaska reserve to drilling

The Department of the Interior finalized a rule last week opening up roughly half of the largely untouched National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to oil and gas drilling. The regulatory change overturns a Biden-era measure blocking oil and gas drilling on 11 million acres of the nation’s largest swath of public land, as my predecessor in anchoring this newsletter, Heatmap’s Jeva Lange, wrote in June. The Trump administration vowed to “unleash” energy production in Alaska by opening the 23 million-acre reserve, as well as nearby Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to exploration. By rescinding the Biden-era restrictions, “we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities, and strengthen American energy security,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement, according to E&E News. In a post on X, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, called the move “yet another step in the right direction for Alaska and American energy dominance.”

The new rule is expected to face challenges in court.“Today’s action is another example of how the Trump administration is trying to take us back in time with its reckless fossil fuels agenda,” Erik Grafe, a lawyer with Earthjustice, an environmental nonprofit group, said in a statement to The New York Times.

2. In a first, UN climate talks address critical minerals

For the first time in United Nations climate negotiations, countries attending the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, are grappling with the effects of mining the minerals needed for batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines, Climate Home News reported. In a draft text on Friday, a working group at the summit recognized “the social and environmental risks associated with scaling up supply chains for clean energy technologies, including risks arising from the extraction and processing of critical minerals.”

The statement came amid ongoing protests from Indigenous groups, including those from Argentina who warned that the world’s increased appetite for South America’s lithium reserves came at the cost of local water resources for peoples who have lived in regions near mining operations for millennia.

3. More than 2,600 EPA employees opt for mass resignation

Nearly one fifth of the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce has opted into President Donald Trump’s mass resignation plan, according to new data E&E News obtained on Friday. The agency had 16,155 employees at the start of this year. As of the end of September, the EPA’s payroll included 15,166 employees, according to data released during the government shutdown, meaning that more than 2,620 employees accepted the “deferred resignation” offer.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has advanced proposals that even the agency under Scott Pruitt, the top environmental regulator at the start of Trump’s first term, dared not attempt. Zeldin has moved to rescind the endangerment finding, which forms the legal basis for virtually all major climate regulations at the EPA. Zeldin even tried to kill off the popular Energy Star program for efficient appliances, but — as I wrote earlier this month — he backed off the plan.

4. Eavor is preparing to launch its next-generation geothermal technology

The next-generation geothermal company Eavor is preparing to start up its debut closed-loop system at its pilot project in Germany, Think Geoenergy reported. The startup has stood out in the race to commercialize technology that can harness energy from the Earth’s molten core in more places than conventional approaches allow. While rivals such as Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS Energy, pursue projects in the American Southwest, Eavor focused its efforts on Germany, where it saw potential to tap into the lucrative district heating market. Eavor also developed special drilling tools that promised to shave “tens of millions” off the cost of digging wells. As I wrote here last month, the company just completed successful tests of its technology.

5. BlackRock launches a $2.3 billion data center venture with a Spanish firm

BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners inked a deal with the Spanish construction company ACS to form a joint venture to develop roughly $2.3 billion worth of data centers. The 50-50 joint venture will consist of ACS’ existing data-center portfolio, including 1.7 gigawatts of assets under development in Europe, the U.S., and Australia. ACS is contributing its existing portfolio to the business, The Wall Street Journal reported, “in exchange for about 1 billion euros in cash and initial earnout payments of up to 1 billion euros” if the data centers hit certain commercial milestones. “Global demand for data centers is set to grow more than 15 times by 2035, driven by the expansion of AI, cloud migration, and the exponential rise in data volumes,” ACS CEO Juan Santamaria said.

Texas super-emitters stand out on the map of US oil and gas methane intensities Note: Outer blue ring shows additional methane leakage from remotely detected super emitters.
US oil and gas production operations are estimated to emit more than 17 million metric tons per year of methane gas.
And production in Texas is ground zero for such leaks, responsible for nearly 40 percent of US oil and gas methane emissions.
Flaring and venting unwanted gas from equipment are the largest sources of oil and gas methane pollution.","As season two of the oil-country drama kicks off, it continues to portray the risks of leaking gas in west Texas and other oil patches worldwide.

In the very first episode of Taylor Sheridan’s latest hit series, the Billy Bob Thornton-led Landman, 14.9 million people got to see the risks that oil workers in the West Texas Permian basin take every day to keep supply flowing.

As workers try and fix a rusty pipe valve, a spark ignites the methane spewing from it, creating an enormous fireball that kills the entire crew, save for the son of Thornton’s character, named Cooper.

While Cooper’s aggressive handling of the valve is initially blamed for the accident, it turns out that such deadly mishaps — as well as routine releases — are not uncommon. With Landman Season 2 airing, new research by RMI shows that wasted gas and methane emissions from West Texas’s oil and gas fields are some of the largest in the United States, as shown on the map below. Moreover, not all assets and operations are the same. One equivalent barrel of West Texas gas can leak over three times more than another barrel from the same region.

Texas super-emitters stand out on the map of US oil and gas methane intensities

Note: Outer blue ring shows additional methane leakage from remotely detected super emitters.

Source: RMI Oil Climate Index plus Gas (OCI+), Map page, October 2025, https://ociplus.rmi.org/

Here’s what Landman gets right about risks in the oil patch

Faulty equipment and outdated machinery cause explosions. Accidents are not the intentional act of oilfield workers. It is reported that more than two workers per month die from explosions, blunt force trauma, poisonous gas, or vehicle crashes. In 2023, someone died every dayon the Permian’s highways in West Texas, double the death count in 2010.

It’s an ongoing battle to keep aging oil and gas fields up and running, as Thornton’s character in Landman knows firsthand. Texas has a reported 278,000 oil and gas wells currently pumping. The majority — 70 percent — are low-producing marginal wells. And over 70,000 wells trickle at less than one barrel of oil and gas equivalent a day. Marginal wells’ oil field equipment, so prevalent in the United States that they can be found in backyards next to swing sets, is not generally equipped to handle gas and can recklessly spew it into the air.

Beyond spewing deadly gas and causing explosions, the gas from leaking wells is laden with dangerous chemicals — like the carcinogen benzene — that poison people and their drinking water. Texas’ regulators are increasingly focused on such “priority wells” that are leaking and pose environmental, safety, or economic risks.

Adequate comprehensive oversight is sorely lacking. US oil and gas production operations are estimated to emit more than 17 million metric tons per year of methane gas. And production in Texas is ground zero for such leaks, responsible for nearly 40 percent of US oil and gas methane emissions. Funding regulators to staff inspectors who can investigate operations is crucial. Last year, the State’s oil regulator requested $100 million to tackle West Texas well blowouts.

Prevention puts money back into Americans’ pockets. Studies estimate that leaking gas represents at least $1 billion annually in US commercial gas value and some $10 billion in annual social cost.

Solutions are readily available, and operators are increasingly turning toward them

Gathering and making data on gas waste public can surface tradeoffs and new opportunities. For too long, gas has been seen by the industry as an unwanted waste product of oil production, allowing it to be squandered by venting and flaring. Today, satellites and other sensing equipment are spotting and measuring methane waste. Ongoing remote sensing offers a path to publicly detect thousands of high-consequence events. Getting this into the hands of operators and policy makers can spur rapid mitigation, updating official emissions inventories, and realistic assessments of effective mitigation technologies tailored for specific regions like West Texas.

An oil and gas operator’s business decisions — and ethics — make a big difference in how much gas leaks, its climate impacts, and overall risks. Flaring and venting unwanted gas from equipment are the largest sources of oil and gas methane pollution. Both are largely preventable. Some companies are beginning to seize the safety, economic, and societal benefits of certifiably producing fewer leaky barrels. This is a huge safety and environmental win. In addition to being toxic and explosive, methane gas is a climate change super-pollutant that heats the planet over 80 times more powerfully than carbon dioxide. The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is currently at the highest level since measurements began. Oil and gas operations offer the easiest and most cost-effective means to slash methane waste.

In the past five years, pioneering efforts have been made to measure and certify oil and gas methane emissions. Cutting-edge opportunities, like MiQ, help companies stop wasting and start making money from their gas. Currently, one in every five cubic feet of US gas has been certified by small and multinational companies alike. And major gas importers, like Europe, are setting the stage for a sizeable price premium on certified low-leakage gas.

Oil and gas operators can take advantage of market incentives to do things the right way. Making it easier than ever for companies to pivot away from outdated practices that lead to excessive leaks will safeguard workers, surrounding communities, and the planet. Taylor Sheridan’s dark television dramas don’t deal in happy endings, but in the real world, we can make the choices that keep us safe, secure, and ready for the future.

This story, a partnership between Grist, Inside Climate News, and Chicago-area public radio station WBEZ, is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Lead pipes are ubiquitous. At this point, no state has gotten rid of all of its toxic lead service lines, which pipe drinking water to homes and businesses. But some cities like Chicago, New York City, and Detroit have more lead plumbing than others, and replacing it can cost tens of thousands of dollars. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Biden-era infrastructure law, promised $15 billion for lead pipe replacements across the country to be disbursed over five years.

But in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency sent earlier this week, a group of Illinois congressional delegates allege that $3 billion appropriated for lead pipe replacements nationwide for the fiscal year that ended in September has not reached communities yet. They warn that the delay is a “dangerous politicization” that puts children and families at risk.

“Federal resources are not partisan tools—they are vital lifelines intended to serve all Americans,” the letter notes. “Using federal funds as leverage against communities based on political considerations represents a dangerous abuse of power that undermines public trust and puts lives at risk.”

The move comes as communities in Illinois, which is among the top five states with the most lead service lines, and across the country are grappling with the overwhelming cost of removing the hazardous metal piping from water systems. The Trump administration has already withheld congressionally appropriated funding for infrastructure and energy projects from Democrat-led states like New York, Colorado, Minnesota, New York, and Massachusetts. Now, lawmakers fear money for lead pipes is stuck in Washington too.

“I think that they’re playing games,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, one of the lawmakers who led the effort to send the letter. “It feels like it’s targeting blue states or blue cities that might require more of this mitigation than other parts of the country.”

Lead is toxic and dangerous to human health. Lead plumbing can flake and dissolve into drinking water, which can lead to brain damage, cardiovascular problems, and reproductive issues. The EPA advises that there is no safe level of lead exposure.

A spokesperson for the federal agency said it is “actively working” on allotments for lead service line replacements. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible for disbursing the federal funds to local governments, did not respond to a request for comment. The Chicago Department of Water Management said it received $14 million from the Illinois EPA for the 2025 financial year and was approved for $28 million for the next fiscal year.

“The estimated replacement cost for the Chicago region alone is $12 billion or more, and statewide, it could be $14 billion,” Krishnamoorthi said. “Whatever amounts would come to Chicago would not be enough to do the entire job, but the federal component is vital to get the ball rolling.”

Chicago has more than 412,000 lead service lines, the most of any city in the country. So far, the city has replaced roughly 14,000 lead pipes at a cost of $400 million over the past five years. That’s due in part to the high cost of replacing lead pipes. In Chicago, a single lead pipe replacement can cost on average $35,000. Federal rules require that Chicago replace all its pipes by 2047, but city officials have cited concerns over the unfunded federal mandate.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WATCHWATER-120422-15-min.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-17 08:59:43.986061

Texas Governor Greg Abbott commented on the scale of the project, stating, “This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state.

""Texas is the epicentre of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy.”

Greg added, “Google's US$40bn investment makes Texas Google's largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state.”

New energy generation and grid stability

A core principle of Google's Texas expansion is that new energy is brought to the grid as new data centre capacity becomes operational.

Google plans to cover the full costs associated with its operations and support energy efficiency programmes within local communities.

To achieve this, Google has confirmed a new US$30m Energy Impact Fund designed to accelerate community energy projects.

This fund is paired with more than 6,200MW of new energy generation secured through power purchase agreements with energy developers.

In a direct example of this synergy, one of the new data centres in Haskell County is situated next to a solar and battery storage plant.

This colocation is designed to support daily operations and enhance power stability.

According to Google, energy abundance, grid stability and cost discipline are key components of the planning model for all its Texas campuses, supported by off-site renewables, storage and long-term agreements.

Amid a resurgent M&A environment for large transactions, those valued at $10 billion and greater, much ink has been spilled about a perceived shift in the regulatory landscape away from the Biden Administration’s approach to M&A review. In recent months, we have seen shorter timelines to closing, a return of remedies to the government’s approval toolkit and a more permissive environment overall. In addition, Congress trusts this FTC.

But a more relaxed regulatory environment has not been universal. Heading into 2025, most dealmakers and corporate leaders did not anticipate that agency review of deals would be hung up by social or workplace culture issues, the federal government would reassert an active industrial policy through tariffs and by undertaking a concerted effort to become a large investor in U.S. public companies through golden shares and other mechanisms.

You'll get all the latest news first by subscribing, but we publish many (but not all) of our forecasts a few days afterward online. Here’s the latest...

Now that the federal tax credit has expired, what is the outlook for electric vehicles in the U.S.? Sales surged as buyers rushed to cash in on the credit before it expired on September 30, then crashed. Here’s how we see the EV market in the longer term.

Once a novelty, EVs are here to stay. But they will occupy a much smaller share of the market in the coming months and beyond, now that the $7,500 federal tax credit is no more. (Note that some states offer tax credits of their own.) Early this year, before talk of Congress axing the credit influenced buyers, EVs accounted for 7.9% of car sales. For the time being, we see that level dropping to 5-6% or so, as demand finds its natural, unsubsidized level.

Surveys show many consumers are interested in electric cars, even if they’re not ready to buy one. Manufacturers will keep building them, but in reduced numbers. Some existing EVs are already getting canceled, along with future models that automakers are now rethinking. Vehicle lineups that were supposed to transition to mostly or all EV in a few years now appear likely to stay mostly gas.

The good news for EV-curious consumers: There will be cheap used models hitting the market in the next few years. EV leasing soared after the Biden era made it easier to qualify for the federal tax credit that way. That flood of used vehicles will be returning to the market, giving value-minded shoppers lots of potential deals.

Cheaper, low-mileage used EVs may be the ticket to convincing wary buyers to consider going electric, now that demand from early adopters has been satisfied. Many drivers won’t be lured, either because an EV doesn’t meet their specific needs or a simple preference for gas. But a decent number of folks appear to be on the fence and may try a used electric model, if the financial math pencils out.

That being said, assuring potential buyers that used EVs’ batteries are sound will be key. Replacing EV batteries costs thousands, even tens of thousands, of dollars. Automakers and dealers will tout new “state of health” certifications showing the useful capacity an EV battery has. They may be rolled into automakers’ certified pre-owned programs, which inspect and vouch for quality used cars, and come with an extended warranty.

More public charging stations will also help, eventually. As of August, the U.S. had 229,000 public charging ports, though they tend to cluster around urban areas, vary in charging capacity and can be prone to failure. More and faster ones are needed. For now, EVs’ lost market share will likely be gobbled up by hybrid models. Consumers are really warming up to them as a compromise that keeps the familiarity and advantages of gas, with fuel efficiency boosted by batteries and electric motors. They’ll likely account for 15% of new car sales soon as more models come as hybrids.

The first order of business for congressional leaders will be to maintain momentum on fiscal 2026 spending. Congress has 11 weeks to pass the remaining nine funding bills, and appropriators remain far apart on top lines and policy riders.

At the same time, lawmakers will rev up committee work — including on energy and environment priorities — following the House’s extended recess.

Republican and Democratic leaders are particularly hoping to make up ground on permitting reform legislation. There could be a markup vote in the coming days.

“We have a lot of business to do, as you all know, and we will be working in earnest,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said last week. “There will be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.”

The shutdown and Johnson’s decision to keep House members in their districts for most of the past two months have created a pileup of pending legislation. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) said last week that of all the bills that have advanced out of committee this year, 150 are awaiting potential floor votes.

“These people have been missing in action, absent without official leave, running scared. But they can no longer hide,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).

The House is poised to vote on a resolution to compel the release of documents associated with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There could also be votes on legislation focused on lawmaker stock trading, cryptocurrency and other issues.

In December, the Senate will vote on a Democratic-backed bill to extend soon-to-expire premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.

Some Republican leaders have floated the potential for a second reconciliation bill, which would allow the majority to pass certain health care policies without Democratic buy-in.

Meanwhile, Armed Services Committee leaders are negotiating the annual defense policy bill with the goal of voting on a compromise version in December. The House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act lean heavily into advanced nuclear energy and environmental cleanups.

Congress will look to make headway on various bipartisan packages that the shutdown stalled, including a bill to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency and legislation to reauthorize pipeline safety programs. A bipartisan highway bill is also in the works.

Funding fights

It took the House and Senate more than three months to negotiate the package of three fiscal 2026 spending bills that Congress passed last week as part of the deal to reopen the government.

Now, Congress will race to pass nine more spending bills before government funding runs out Jan. 31. Senate leaders have already lined up a package of at least three more bills for bipartisan, bicameral negotiations: Defense, Labor-HHS-Education and Transportation-HUD.

Two more spending bills — Interior-Environment and Commerce-Justice-Science — are also in the mix, but those have been mired by appropriators’ disagreements about policy riders and funding levels. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) has objections about top lines in the bill that funds the Department of the Interior and EPA.

Lawmakers are eager to avoid another shutdown, but Democrats have not telegraphed how they might respond if appropriations bills don’t pass on time, if the Trump administration continues its unilateral funding cuts or if the health care issue is not resolved.

“We’re going to try to take that weapon out of their hand,” Johnson said Friday on Fox Business, referring to Democrats’ recent attempt to use a shutdown for leverage.

“What I mean by that is over these next several intense days, these next couple months, we’ll be working around the clock to make sure we get more of these appropriations bills through the process,” Johnson said.

Lawmakers have their work cut out for them. The House has not passed most of its fiscal 2026 bills on the floor. The Senate is even further behind; the chamber has yet to release and mark up four of its spending bills.

Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), chair of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, said he expects his bill to hit the House floor for a vote as soon as this week. From there, it would enter informal negotiations with Senate appropriators.

“We need to move on ours so we can go to conference,” Simpson said. “There’s always differences, and that’s OK. That’s what conferences are all about.”

The Energy-Water bill remains stuck. It passed the House by one vote earlier this year, but the Senate has not yet finalized its own version.

Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Kennedy, the chair of the Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, are at an impasse over funding levels in the bill. Kennedy wants his bill to reduce spending on renewable energy and other programs while maintaining funding for the Army Corps of Engineers and the nuclear stockpile.

Kennedy has said his version of the bill has a discretionary top line 1 percent below the currently enacted level and is ready for a markup. However, committee leaders have not released it.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member on the Energy-Water Subcommittee, indicated that the dispute over the bill’s top line had been elevated to Collins. Murray said she is “waiting for Sen. Collins to do something” about it. A spokesperson for Collins said they did not have an update on the bill’s status.

“I’m going with my bill, and if the Appropriations Committee or the chairwoman or the vice chairwoman don’t like it, I respect their opinion, but they got one vote and I got one vote, and mine is the only bill that reduces spending,” Kennedy said.

“I know that is a new experience for everybody on the committee,” he added, “but I’m not backing down, and that’s kind of where I am.”

Permitting reform

One discussion that didn’t grind to a halt even as the government shuttered? Permitting.

As the longest government shutdown in history delayed much legislative progress, lawmakers in both chambers continued to meet with each other and with energy industry and tech lobbyists who have showed up to the Capitol to press members to advance legislation intended to boost energy supply.

“The shutdown has given us a lot of time to review the legislation, to work with other members,” House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) said last week just before voting to end the shutdown. “I think we’re really tying the legislation up and have a real high-quality piece of legislation.”

He’s gearing up to hold a markup as early as this week on his bipartisan bill, H.R. 4776, the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” to amend the National Environmental Policy Act process to set firmer deadlines and reduce the judicial review period.

Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) is a co-sponsor, and Westerman said their teams are taking input from other committee Democrats who “had some issues.”

Across the Capitol, key senators have been trading draft proposals on a larger package that — to get Democratic buy-in — would include transmission infrastructure, a net reduction in emissions and safeguards for permitted projects. Democrats are also demanding that the Trump administration must stop attacking clean energy projects.

But Westerman does not necessarily see the “SPEED Act” as part of a bipartisan trade, and he was not eager to talk about transmission, saying it’s not part of his committee’s jurisdiction.

“I’m not pushing for that,” he said. “What I’m pushing for is to keep the SPEED Act clean. Because if we start tacking stuff onto it, the line would be across the Capitol from people who want carve-outs.”

At the same time, he acknowledged any piece of legislation could grow in order to get it on the president’s desk.

“I think what people have to realize is NEPA reform helps everything,” he said. “It helps electrical transmission. It helps pipelines. It helps traditional energy sources. It helps new energy sources. It helps transportation and infrastructure projects. So if all we pass — and I hate to say if all — but if only NEPA passes, everybody wins.”

NDAA nearing completion

House and Senate negotiators are getting close to finalizing the fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. It is likely to carry a number of provisions on nuclear energy, critical minerals and environmental cleanups.

Armed Services Committee leaders plan to unveil a compromise NDAA by Thanksgiving, with the goal of having the House and Senate vote on it by mid-December.

There are some differences between the bills, but lawmakers involved say they are not far from a final deal. They have been working on bridging the $32 billion gulf between the House and Senate bills’ funding authorizations and will likely remove most of the culture-war provisions House lawmakers added to their version.

“We’re in a better position on this NDAA than we have been for the last two or three years, as far as the narrow number of issues that were still outstanding,” House Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) told reporters Wednesday.

Negotiators are having to sort out differences on energy and environment policies. For example, in October, the Senate added a major nuclear energy bill to its version, as well as language to crack down on illegal fishing and to expand efforts to map reserves of critical minerals and rare earth elements.

The Senate bill includes a bipartisan housing bill that contains a number of provisions on environmental reviews and disaster recovery.

Both bills have similar language promoting the Pentagon’s embrace of advanced nuclear energy. They would require the Department of Defense to establish advanced nuclear energy working groups.

They also contain provisions dedicated to promoting resilience on military installations and addressing contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

Reconciliation 2.0?

President Donald Trump earlier this month called on Senate Republicans to scrap the legislative filibuster in order to reopen the government without Democratic votes. While Republican leaders opted not to take that route, there is some interest in finding other ways to get around Democratic opposition.

Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he is meeting with other Republicans about the possibility of passing a second reconciliation bill this Congress, following up on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“I want us to look at what a reconciliation package, a new one, would look like,” Graham told POLITICO earlier this month. “We could do some things on health care. We can do some things on policy, taxes and spending.”

The GOP accomplished much of its legislative agenda with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A second party-line bill would take up a significant amount of committee time and energy, and many Republicans are not eager to do it all again.

House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) told POLITICO’s E&E News earlier this year that he does not think there are many energy-related policies left to pursue in a potential second reconciliation bill. Other committee leaders also cast doubt on using reconciliation to pass more energy and natural resources policies.

Westerman said earlier this year that he had been having discussions to prepare for another effort, but his committee has not produced any formal proposals.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ae/7c/acc77baf485b852ab6499fc8f48f/u-s-congress-29295.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 11:08:16.126382

Tesla is requiring suppliers to eliminate China-made components from vehicles built in its U.S. factories.

Tesla is expanding non-China sourcing, including new battery production efforts in the United States.

Tesla is pushing suppliers to eliminate China-made components from vehicles built in its U.S. factories, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The effort marks one of the automaker’s strongest moves yet to separate its American production from China and reflects the growing impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on global automotive supply chains.

Tesla and its suppliers have already replaced several China-made parts, and the company plans to complete a full transition to non-China components within the next one to two years. The shift affects parts used across Tesla’s U.S. manufacturing operations at a time when fluctuating tariffs and geopolitical disputes have made planning and pricing strategies more difficult. The Journal reported that the company intensified its sourcing changes this year after President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on imports from China.

The push to diversify suppliers follows years of growing dependence on China. Tesla’s Shanghai plant uses a supply base of about 400 Chinese direct suppliers, and more than 60 of them have previously supported production at Tesla factories worldwide. While Shanghai-built models are shipped to Asia and Europe, they are not exported to the United States.

Automakers across the industry are reevaluating their reliance on China due to rare-earth restrictions, semiconductor shortages and rising political friction. Tesla executives have faced repeated supply disruptions, including chip shortages tied to a conflict between China and the Netherlands that limited exports from a Dutch semiconductor firm whose packaging is done in China. The situation renewed internal discussions about accelerating diversification efforts.

Other manufacturers have made similar moves. General Motors recently instructed thousands of suppliers to remove China-made components from their supply chains. Trade actions by both governments have created widespread concern across the sector as automakers work to secure essential inputs ranging from batteries to magnets to electronic components.

Tesla has been encouraging longtime China-based suppliers to relocate production to Mexico and Southeast Asia. The company also stopped selling U.S. vehicles with China-made lithium-iron-phosphate batteries last year because of tariff implications and ineligibility for EV tax credits. Tesla is now building LFP batteries for its energy-storage products in Nevada, with operations expected to begin in early 2026.

The United States remains Tesla’s largest market, and the company is working to expand domestic and non-China sourcing to stabilize its U.S. production.

That unity lasted about a week. On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro helped tear it back open.

The Democratic rising star cut a deal to end his state’s four-month budget stalemate: In exchange for Republicans supporting about $2 billion in additional spending, Pennsylvania would drop its yearslong effort to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the cap-and-trade system covering the electricity sectors of 10 states.

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged on the trail to reduce Virginians’ electric bills and support local energy production.

The energy mix should include offshore wind development, she said in campaign materials, as well as solar projects in “commonsense locations” like abandoned mines and former industrial sites. While the document didn’t mention natural gas, Spanberger in August said that the fuel is going to “be part of the energy mix into the future.”

“She really does believe the energy demands that you see on the horizon in the commonwealth require all forms of energy, including gas,” said Bruce McKay, chair of the Natural Gas Coalition of Virginia.

McKay — who said the new coalition isn’t “anti-anything” — said natural gas sits “right at the intersection of reliability and affordability” and can be a “workhorse” along with other energy sources to address rising electricity demand. Environmental critics point to the fuel’s climate-warming emissions, even though it burns more cleanly than coal. They also emphasize projections of rising natural gas prices.

Spanberger’s campaign did not return a request for comment on the future of natural gas in Virginia.

During her campaign, she didn’t take a stand against natural gas or indicate that certain pipeline projects need to be stopped, according to analysts at strategy firm Capstone said.

Jack Buckley, a senior associate on Capstone’s energy team, said he didn’t think Spanberger’s administration would “really limit or disadvantage existing or new natural gas pipeline infrastructure” in Virginia.

“Given the demands of data centers, especially in Northern Virginia, where there’s a high concentration, and the subsequent affordability concerns that are spurred by this, I think that she will have to accept natural gas infrastructure given the significant energy needs of the state,” he said.

But environmental groups dispute the gas industry’s stance that more gas pipelines and plants would make energy more affordable.

Lee Francis, chief program and communications officer at the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, referenced recent analyses — including from the Department of Energy’s statistical arm — projecting an increase in natural gas prices.

“This election was won in part on promises to lower energy costs for Virginians, and I think building or approving lots of new gas infrastructure would be counter to that,” Francis said. “I think that’s how you raise people’s bills and keep them high for years to come.”

Spanberger’s victory comes more than five years after former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, signed the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) into law that calls for major electricity providers to be carbon-free by 2045 and 2050, and mandating the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade system for the power sector.

Francis said Spanberger’s comments on gas are aligned with Virginia’s existing energy laws.

“The thing I’m optimistic about is a Spanberger administration that actually wants to get serious about increasing renewables, instead of standing in the way — which is what we’ve seen in the past four years as electric bills have gotten higher,” Francis said.

The governor of Virginia is in charge of key appointments — such as the director of the Virginia Department of Energy and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which oversee energy initiatives and permitting.

Jay Jones, the newly elected Democratic attorney general of Virginia, also ran on a pledge to lower electricity costs. Staff in the attorney general’s office argue rate cases and other utility issues at the Virginia State Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities.

But former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, said in a statement that Spanberger’s “understanding of the importance of natural gas” — working with renewables — “will serve as a foundation for Virginia’s continuing economic growth and keep utility prices affordable for businesses and families.”

Landrieu is co-chair of Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, a natural gas advocacy group.

Power generation

With Election Day in the review mirror, Spanberger is now facing calls to revisit the 2020 law and adopt a more pro-natural gas stance as she prepares to take office in January.

Spanberger has said she’s “fine with keeping existing natural gas infrastructure — she’s a little skeptical of new infrastructure — but reality is going to come to her and show her that we need new natural gas infrastructure,” said Gabriella Hoffman, director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at the Independent Women’s Forum, a conservative nonprofit.

Even with its clean energy law and RGGI, Virginia hasn’t seen mass wind and solar adoption, she said.

Natural gas already accounted for more than 60 percent of electricity generation in Virginia in August, federal data shows, with nuclear power coming in a distance second at 24 percent of the mix.

While energy demand in the state stayed flat between 2006 and 2020, “unconstrained demand for power in Virginia is expected to double within the next 10 years, driven primarily by the data center industry’s growth,” a Virginia legislative commission said in a December 2024 report to the governor and the state’s General Assembly.

Northern Virginia is the world’s biggest data center market, the report said, and was home to some 13 percent of global data center capacity.

Utilities across the Southeast are pursuing natural gas projects as energy demand rises. In March, for example, Dominion Energy filed an application with a Virginia state agency to build a nearly one gigawatt gas-fired power plant in Chesterfield County, south of Richmond.

In a recent integrated resource plan update last month, Dominion said that under its preferred plan for the next 20 years it would build 17.5 gigawatts of solar, 2 GW of storage, six small modular reactors, 3.4 GW of offshore wind, and 8.5 GW of gas-fired assets.

“Tech companies, lawmakers, stakeholders — everyone across Virginia, regardless of politics or the political background — has said that we need to have natural gas in the equation, not only to meet this rising demand from [artificial intelligence] data centers, but because right now existing natural gas especially still is overwhelmingly cheaper,” Hoffman said.

Still, in its latest monthly report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said the U.S. benchmark gas natural price is expected to average $4 per million British thermal units in 2026, up over 14 percent from the estimated average of $3.50 for 2025, due to increased liquefied natural gas exports and plateaued production.

Higher natural gas prices have pushed up renewable and coal-fueled electricity production in the U.S.

Natural gas affects households and small businesses in two ways: through utility services for heating and cooking, and the fuel’s role in power generation, said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program.

People are using natural gas as a fuel for power plants and in homes at the same time the U.S. is exporting record levels of LNG — forcing up demand and prices as EIA noted, Slocum said.

The more exposure Virginia has to natural gas, he said, the more expensive that energy bills will become.

“Gas is only going to get more expensive going forward,” Slocum said. “You can build more pipelines in Virginia or anywhere else, but that extra natural gas is still going to be competing with folks in Berlin and Beijing for access to the U.S. gas.”

In a statement, Landrieu said prices rise when supply is constricted.

“If we want to meet the growing energy needs in Virginia and other states across the country, the answer is more natural gas infrastructure to move more energy supplies where it’s needed to address this record demand impacting residents and businesses,” Landrieu said.

McKay with the Natural Gas Coalition of Virginia said his group is focused on ensuring that the “additional gas that might be needed for power [generation] can get where it is needed, when it is needed, to support that piece.”

Spanberger will take steps to start address the state’s energy crisis even before she gets into office, McKay said.

“It’s a high priority and my guess is she’ll get after it, probably before she’s sworn into office,” he said.

Pipeline plans

Another focus for the oil and gas sector is tying the answer to energy affordability to more natural gas pipelines.

And like Virginia, New Jersey recently elected a Democrat to be its next governor — Rep. Mikie Sherrill — with energy issues on the table.

“The governors-elect in both New Jersey and Virginia identified natural gas as critical to a more affordable energy future,” Amy Andryszak, CEO of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said in a statement. “But to deliver on that promise, we will need more pipelines and infrastructure to deliver the fuel to homes and businesses.”

In May 2023, Spanberger joined fellow House Democrats from Virginia in submitting an amendment to the House Rules Committee that sought to strip out a provision expediting approvals for the Mountain Valley pipeline from a debt ceiling law.

In a news release at the time, the lawmakers said permitting for the line had “nothing to do with our nation’s spending” and that green-lighting Mountain Valley “undermines our efforts to accelerate the deployment of clean-energy technologies and curb harmful greenhouse gas emissions.”

Still, the provision stayed in the measure that became law and the Mountain Valley pipeline began operating last year. It transports natural gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia.

Mountain Valley is actively working to extend the 303-mile pipeline with the Southgate amendment project, which would add 31 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline. Last week, a North Carolina agency approved a water quality certification for the project.

In a post-election analysis, Capstone said the Spanberger administration could “pose headwinds to new natural gas infrastructure projects” in Virginia, while adding that she “has campaigned on an energy platform that supports continued use of natural gas.”

“I think when it comes to new natural gas infrastructure, that’s where we really need to be focused and sort of thinking carefully about the lifespan of those projects and whether indeed they are the most cost-effective solution,” Spanberger told Inside Climate News earlier this year.

Still, last month, the Virginia Department of Energy announced a new energy industry partnership to undertake a “comprehensive study identifying opportunities” to increase natural gas power generation, including identifying locations in southwest Virginia “where new natural gas pipeline infrastructure can support new power generation facilities.”

And potential pipelines are on the drawing board for Virginia.

The proposed MVP Southgate and Southeast Supply Enhancement projects would cut through Virginia to North Carolina, which Francis said is doubling down on gas.

The pipeline projects would each involve laying new pipe in sections of both states.

“The fossil fuel developers are fighting with each other on how to get into that market, and Virginia is really kind of a sacrificial lamb in the energy race to get to North Carolina,” said Francis of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters. “That’s what’s been going on with a lot of these pipeline projects.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/43/10/2e6630724a46b1344e67f6c5b388/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2242481038,N,,2025-11-17 07:59:17.595035

“By expanding our network of charging stations, we hope to see that number continue to climb,” Beld said.","A program to expand electric vehicle charging stations in Wisconsin is getting a $14 million jolt with plans to build 26 more stations across the state.

Gov. Tony Evers and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation announced the expansion plan Monday.

The announcement recharges the state’s electrical vehicle charging network project, supported by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. NEVI, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law signed by then-President Joe Biden, provides grants to states to build more charging stations.

“Transportation is evolving, and departments of transportation and states have to adapt with that evolution,” said John DesRivieres, WisDOT’s communications director. “As the market and the number of folks who are driving electric vehicles grows, EV infrastructure is needed.”

NEVI funding paused after President Donald Trump took office, and Wisconsin was one of 15 states along with the District of Columbia to sue the Trump administration in May for cutting off money for the program. A federal judge blocked the administration in June from defunding NEVI, and the Wisconsin DOT subsequently restarted its program.

The $14 million in federal funds for Wisconsin’s new round of charging stations will go to projects in communities throughout the state, from Superior in the northwest to East Troy in the southeast. They include 11 locations at Kwik Trip service stations, six locations at hotels or resorts, six locations at other service station brands and a handful of other businesses.

“My administration and I have prioritized ensuring our state’s infrastructure meets the needs of the 21st Century since Day One because expanding our clean energy and electric vehicle infrastructure helps create jobs and bolster our economy, and it’s good for our planet, too,” Evers said. “Thanks to our actions to get the Trump Administration to release this critical funding that they were illegally withholding, we are thrilled to see the NEVI program continue to support these goals and further move us toward the clean energy future Wisconsinites deserve.”

The transportation department chose projects based on their location, their potential for future development, and the business site’s hours. Extended hours were given preference to accommodate longer refueling times, according to WisDOT.

Wisconsin’s plan calls for charging stations along 15 major interstate, U.S. and state highway corridors that cross the state. A WisDOT EV charging station dashboard shows the locations for all planned chargers in the state.

With the round of grants announced Monday, Wisconsin has invested a total of $36.4 million in federal funds for 78 projects.

The first round, announced in May 2024, invested $22.4 million to build 52 stations. Of those, 11 are operational, 16 have been authorized for construction and the rest are in pre-construction phases.

A federal tax credit for electric vehicles that was included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act abruptly ended, effective Sept. 30, under the Republican tax-cut and spending mega-bill enacted in July.

“There are already 37,000 EVs on the road today, and we saw that number spike as people raced to purchase EVs before the federal tax credit expired,” said Alex Beld, communications director for Renew Wisconsin, a nonprofit that promotes policies and programs to expand solar, wind and hydropower along with building electrification, energy storage and electric vehicles.

“By expanding our network of charging stations, we hope to see that number continue to climb,” Beld said. “Through this transition away from gas-powered vehicles, we can reduce emissions and support our state’s economy.”

An analysis by SRI International published in 2023 for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. concluded that “there is a tremendous opportunity for Wisconsin to develop a globally competitive cluster centered on the manufacturing of EVs and EV-related equipment, which in turn can help revitalize Wisconsin’s automotive manufacturing industry and drive statewide economic development.”

Beld said that jobs related to clean energy grew four times faster than the rest of Wisconsin’s economy in 2024.

“If this funding had been clawed back permanently, I think we would have still seen progress,” Beld said. “It would have certainly been slower and would have likely cost the state jobs.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-99/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kwik-trip-charge-station-1024x5761763380160.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=QIbQc1yg,N,,2025-11-17 07:59:31.515851

Last week at the Crain’s “Powering Illinois’ Future” event in Chicago, I introduced a group of business and industry leaders to ComEd’s new Long-Range Strategy.
Currently, structural market issues are inhibiting power supply growth, causing it to fall well off the pace of demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing and increasing electrification.

But ComEd’s new long-range strategy, along with the statewide spirit of collaboration, fills me with optimism about the future of ComEd, our region and our state.","Projections of future power demand are rising faster than new power supply is coming online. That’s the mismatch driving up electricity prices for customers – and there needs to be a plan to tackle this and other energy challenges the future has in store.

Last week at the Crain’s “Powering Illinois’ Future” event in Chicago, I introduced a group of business and industry leaders to ComEd’s new Long-Range Strategy. I’d like to give readers a brief overview today.

First, some important context on affordability: While ComEd’s name is on the bills customers receive, our company is only responsible for the delivery of power to customers – not the supply. ComEd does not generate power. We do not profit from the increase in supply costs that has been the biggest driver of bill hikes.

Currently, structural market issues are inhibiting power supply growth, causing it to fall well off the pace of demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing and increasing electrification.

A regional transmission organization, PJM, manages the supply market in northern Illinois and a dozen states to the east. Unfortunately, PJM’s reforms have not come fast enough, and they have not gone far enough.

At ComEd, we’re pulling every lever within reach to keep prices from rising further:

We’ve introduced tariffs that would protect customers from bearing the cost burden of data centers and other large load projects if they fail to materialize.

We’ve helped customers install over 1,300 megawatts of solar across our territory, and we’ve interconnected over 5,000 megawatts of utility-scale wind power – new supply that helps balance the uptick in demand.

ComEd’s Energy Efficiency programs, first launched in 2008, have produced $12 billion in customer savings.

Since ComEd’s smart grid improvements in 2012, we’ve enhanced overall reliability by more than 57 percent, helping customers avoid nearly 24.7 million customer interruptions and save more than $4.3 billion in outage-related costs.

We’ve connected 140,000 of our most vulnerable customers to over $72 million in financial assistance, just in the first nine months of 2025 alone.

The new ComEd Long-Range Strategy will build on this record of success. It is designed around three P’s. The first is People.

We will expand and improve programs that allow ComEd customers to make simple, smart energy choices that deliver value and affordability, while positioning people in our communities to benefit from opportunities created by the global move toward a more electrified future.

The second “P” is for Power. It means ComEd will deepen its investments in modernizing the grid, creating a “digital twin” of the grid that gives us visibility and data insights that improve efficiency. The grid will be more AI-enabled, able to prevent more outages.

The grid is the oxygen of today’s modern economy, and it will only become more vital to the economy of tomorrow.

The third “P” is for Progress. This means advancing Illinois’ vision for clean energy investments that enable economic development. So ComEd will continue to support growth in electric vehicles and renewable energy; we will continue to train workers for careers in clean energy infrastructure; and all of this will help us deliver on state policy goals, including a grid with 100% clean energy.

The passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act is a step forward for Illinois and is aligned with key aspects of ComEd’s new strategy, especially managing load growth and lowering costs for customers.

Of course, more work must be done, and more challenges are surely ahead. But ComEd’s new long-range strategy, along with the statewide spirit of collaboration, fills me with optimism about the future of ComEd, our region and our state.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/ComEd%20TLR%20hero%20first%20option.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 10:00:32.109599

Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president.
The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.
But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.
During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.","WASHINGTON (AP) — More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data — a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.

Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.

Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.

“There’s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they’re falling behind,” Margetta Morgan said.

Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.

These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living.

Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year’s midterm elections.

Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills — meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.

The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration’s reputation.

“In fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,” Trump posted on social media Friday. “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems,”

Nearly 6 million households have utility debt “so severe” that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation’s analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel.

During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills.

“Voters are frustrated and families are hurting because these tech giants are cutting backroom deals with politicians, and it’s causing their power bills to go up,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, which contributed to the analysis. “If the Trump administration doesn’t want to do its job and protect families and make life more affordable, I guess that’s its choice.”

Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau.

The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy.

“Electricity prices are a state problem,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. “There are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.”

The Century Foundation analysis counters that the Trump administration is contributing to higher utility costs “by impeding renewable energy generation” including solar and wind power.

While the new analysis is a warning sign, other economic analyses on consumers suggest their finances are stable despite some emerging pressures.

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalysed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution centre in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centres in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment” added Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

This links environmental management performance with employee performance, encouraging deep participation in environmental protection actions across the company.
In 2024 alone, the company invested approximately 370 million RMB in environmental protection, achieving a record of zero environmental pollution incidents.
The Amazon is a key area for global biodiversity conservation.
This also confirms LONGi's solemn commitment to ""driving a just global energy transition through technological innovation.""","BELÉM, Brazil, November 15 – LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (""LONGi"") released its first Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) report during the 30th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This report, following the joint biodiversity protection initiative launched by LONGi and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2024, is the company's first TNFD report. It aims to systematically review the company's practices and management actions concerning nature-related issues throughout 2024.

In 2025, LONGi has become a TNFD Adopter. The report strictly adheres to the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) analytical framework recommended by the TNFD to identify, assess, and manage various nature-related risks and opportunities. It clearly states long-term goals to achieve ""Net Zero Loss"" of biodiversity and ""Zero Deforestation"" by 2050. This commitment reflects LONGi's high regard for biodiversity protection and climate action, aligning with global sustainable development trends. Through this pledge, LONGi demonstrates the responsibility and accountability of an industry leader, injecting Chinese strength into global ecosystem protection and climate action.

As early as the COP29 Conference in 2024, LONGi collaborated with the IUCN to jointly release the ""Initiative of Advancing Climate Action and Biodiversity Conservation with Photovoltaic."" This initiative called on more companies to formulate and implement climate and biodiversity protection measures based on international Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and global standards, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UNFCCC, and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). It advocated for adhering to global best practices to ensure all activities meet global climate and biodiversity requirements, adopting environmentally friendly methods in the design, construction, and operation of renewable energy projects, improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of clean energy, fostering a corporate culture of biodiversity protection, and promoting international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and dissemination of global best practices through partnerships.

LONGi has long engaged in capacity-building exchanges on biodiversity with the IUCN, benchmarking against leading international standards to effectively enhance the company's ability to integrate biodiversity conservation into its medium and long-term strategic planning. At the event, Li Zhenguo shared the story of how green photovoltaic power is improving the living conditions of indigenous people in the Amazon rainforest, showcasing LONGi's numerous practices and explorations in deeply integrating biodiversity protection into its core business. Furthermore, the company proposed a nature-positive pathway of ""Prevention First, Ecological Empowerment, and Collaborative Transformation,"" demonstrating a shift from ""impact mitigation"" to ""active contribution.""

Starting from COP15 Conference of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity held in Kunming, China, in 2021, LONGi has continuously focused on how photovoltaic technology can promote biodiversity conservation and has actively engaged in practical exploration. During COP28 Conference, LONGi announced its ""Zero-Carbon Life Plan for Pandas,"" which included donating a distributed photovoltaic power station to the Qinling Panda Foping Rescue and Breeding Research Center in China, permanently adopting a Qinling giant panda, and providing photovoltaic products and off-grid technology to support field monitoring equipment in the reserve. Earlier, in 2022, LONGi donated PV modules to the Aquila Wildlife Protection Base in South Africa, providing not only daily electricity for the reserve but also enabling a clean water supply for wildlife, offering more possibilities for the ecological management of Aquila.

In terms of corporate operations and management, LONGi has established the ""E20 Environmental Standardization Management Method,"" implementing a three-tier management model from the group level to individual bases. This links environmental management performance with employee performance, encouraging deep participation in environmental protection actions across the company. In 2024 alone, the company invested approximately 370 million RMB in environmental protection, achieving a record of zero environmental pollution incidents. At the operational level, it reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 37% year-on-year, decreased water consumption per unit by 24.8%, and achieved a harmless waste recycling rate of 82.7%.

The Amazon is a key area for global biodiversity conservation. However, in recent years, it has faced a series of serious threats such as deforestation, illegal mining, and land occupation. In 2024 November, LONGi, in partnership with a key customer and prestigious NGOs, installed 35 off grid intermittent energy systems in residential houses, schools, health stations, and community centers in Pykany village, located within the Kayapó Menkragnoti Indigenous Territory in Brazil, completely replacing the heavily polluting diesel generators, effectively reducing carbon emissions, and decreasing dependence on fossil fuels. The construction of renewable power systems has significantly reduced health hazards for tribal residents and greatly improved the quality of life for women and children. After getting rid of time-consuming and labor-intensive fuel collection work (such as firewood cutting and carrying), local women are able to make handicrafts at night and rest more during the day, forming a sustainable source of income. Male villagers have also reduced their hunting and fishing time due to the circulation of electricity, and have opened up new economic income generating projects. By reducing carbon emissions and minimizing energy-related disturbances to the rainforest ecosystem, the project supports both community development and environmental conservation, bringing green energy to foster biodiversity protection and sustainable development in the Amazon rainforest.

By bringing light and hope to the tribal communities with its high-efficiency photovoltaic technology and products, LONGi profoundly embodies the core SDG objectives of using clean energy as an engine to promote global health equity, economic empowerment, and ecological protection. This also confirms LONGi's solemn commitment to ""driving a just global energy transition through technological innovation."" The release of this report not only represents LONGi's latest progress in the field of sustainable development but also provides an important reference for how green energy can advance global biodiversity conservation and climate action.

Li Zhenguo stated that in the future, the company will systematically identify, assess, and manage nature-related risks and opportunities by strictly following the TNFD framework, exploring more actionable and cutting-edge practices for corporate biodiversity protection and sustainable development.

Independent power producer Terra-Gen has announced the commissioning of the Monte Cristo I wind farm in Hidalgo County, Texas. With an installed capacity of 238.5 megawatts (MW), the facility will generate over 850 gigawatt-hours annually, equivalent to the electricity consumption of 81,000 households. Two corporations have secured the site’s electricity output through long-term power purchase agreements.

A strategic location with local economic impact

This development marks Terra-Gen’s second wind project in Texas, following the Big Spring facility. The company’s total power generation capacity in the state now stands at 273 MW. Monte Cristo I is part of a growth strategy focused on high wind potential areas.

During the construction phase, approximately 280 jobs were created at peak activity. The works recorded over 490,000 hours without a lost-time incident, according to company data. The project also delivered upgrades to local infrastructure, including more than 11 miles of Texas Department of Transportation roads and 25 miles of county roads.

In the rural parishes of Calcasieu, Cameron, and Vermillion, the so-called Southwest Coastal Louisiana Home Elevation Project allocates more than $400 million to raise the heights of residents’ homes by placing them on stilts or laying thicker foundations.
To understand why this is, the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund conducted focus groups of residents from the three parishes.
The cost of insurance in Louisiana is 44% higher than the national average because of the state’s high flood risk, according to a 2025 LendingTree analysis.","Louisiana’s land is disappearing for many reasons: rising sea levels, erosion, wetland degradation, and more frequent severe storms all contributed to a loss of more than 2,000 square miles of coastline between 1932 and 2015, according to estimates from the state’s government.

These risks are expected to increase over the next 25 years. A Climate Central analysis showed the likelihood of coastal flooding in the U.S. will increase tenfold by 2050, affecting an estimated 2.5 million people. Louisiana ranked fourth in the analysis’ list of states with the most people at risk, but tops the list for the amount of land it is expected to lose to flooding by 2050, at about 9,200 square miles.

Cities like New Orleans have built structural protections called levees to abate the land loss, but some flood-prone rural areas have been left to weather the coming storms without such protection.

A new home-elevation project led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority is an attempt to change this — if they can get the rural communities on board.

In the rural parishes of Calcasieu, Cameron, and Vermillion, the so-called Southwest Coastal Louisiana Home Elevation Project allocates more than $400 million to raise the heights of residents’ homes by placing them on stilts or laying thicker foundations. About 3,900 properties have been identified in the three parishes to have a severe risk of flooding and could potentially qualify for the program.

The Corps broke ground on the first home in October of 2024, but since then community participation in the project has been much lower than anticipated — even though it comes at no cost to approved applicants.

To understand why this is, the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund conducted focus groups of residents from the three parishes. The reasons they found ranged from high levels of skepticism and distrust of the project to a history of abandonment by the state and federal governments during past hurricane seasons.

In 2020, after Hurricane Laura made landfall in southwestern Louisiana on top of Cameron Parish, some communities in the region had to wait a year or longer to receive disaster aid. Many homes required significant repairs, making people less willing to go through yet another construction project.

“A good amount of these residents expressed that they have had really bad experiences with contractors that have come and done work on their homes,” said Allie Olsonoski, project manager of climate resilient coasts and watersheds for the Environmental Defense Fund.

Olsonoksi was at the focus groups as they happened and wrote a report on the key takeaways. Among them, she found that homeowners want assurance that they won’t be held liable if something goes wrong with the construction.

“There is a level of distrust of government intervention in the first place,” Olsonoski said. “‘Mr. Federal Government’ coming in and changing communities, people are weary of that.”

There were also questions about how the project could affect participants’ homeowners insurance. The cost of insurance in Louisiana is 44% higher than the national average because of the state’s high flood risk, according to a 2025 LendingTree analysis.

While the project does not require applicants to have flood insurance, some residents have wondered if their participation in the program could help lower their flood insurance premiums. But there are also questions about how their homeowners insurance could be affected by factors like wind if their homes are higher in the air.

So far, no one involved in the project’s rollout is comfortable answering these questions, according to Olsonoski.

“There are just question marks around that that no one is able to answer at this moment in time, but hopefully as homes are elevated, that becomes illuminated,” she said.

Even with the concerns people had, Olsonoski said there was still hope from many of the residents about the project’s potential to help them “adapt in place” to a changing climate.

“If there is an opportunity for them to make their homes safer into the future so that they may be passed down to their kids and grandchildren, like those homes were passed down to them, that’s a really, really important and exciting opportunity,” she said.

“This [project] allows them to be in the same spot down the block from their neighbors, their friends, their family.” More information about the project and how to apply can be found here.

There’s an old climate joke that goes, “You may not believe in climate change, but your insurance company does.” If you’re in the market for new environmental humor — and really, who isn’t? — you can now update this to say, “You may not believe in climate change, but the stock market does.”

For much of this year, the S&P Global Clean Energy Index has outpaced the S&P 500 Index, the Nasdaq 100 Index and the MSCI World Index, Bloomberg News noted recently as part of a report about Jefferies analysts unexpectedly declaring these the “glory days” for green tech.

Anyone who’s been following the news would be forgiven for assuming these are not salad days for clean energy. Dog-food days, more like it. Whatever-this-is days. The White House and an eager Congress have shredded environmental regulations and cleantech subsidies, thrown up roadblocks to new wind and solar projects and generally tried to make life as comfortable as possible for the fossil-fuel industry currently running the government and as uncomfortable as possible for that industry’s upstart rivals.

And yet! Those same clean-energy sources that have been banished to America’s political wilderness are also in hot demand at home and around the world, thanks in part to President Donald Trump’s determination to put energy-hungry AI everywhere all at once.

As Bloomberg News notes, many of the stocks leading the boom in the S&P clean-energy index also have ties to the boom in AI. In other words, this may not be entirely a bet on a net-zero future but partly people seeing a gold rush and buying shovel makers. If the robot-industrial complex is a bubble just waiting to pop, then green tech’s lofty roost could be precarious.

Then again, both the S&P and the Nasdaq 100 also look like AI-rich souffles these days, making cleantech’s outperformance all the more notable. While the use case for AI is still in flux — will it save humanity or just stupefy it with slop? — the need for reliable energy has been clear for centuries.

And other stocks related to climate change are also beating the broader market. Bloomberg’s Prepare and Repair Index, made up of companies that benefit from the rise in expensive climate-fueled disasters, has absolutely trounced the S&P over the past five years, more than doubling its return, Bloomberg Green noted recently. These are almost the opposite of AI stocks: stuff like hardware stores, insurers and waste managers.

The clean-energy and prepare-repair indexes represent two sides of the climate-change coin: mitigation and adaptation. Though billionaire Bill Gates has somewhat fatalistically suggested the world lean into the latter, he is also still investing money in the former. His Breakthrough Energy Ventures is part of a group of more than a dozen venture capitalists, called the All Aboard Coalition, trying to raise $300 million to invest in clean tech. Investors pumped $56 billion into such companies in the first three quarters of 2025, more than in all of 2024, according to BloombergNEF.

For every dollar lost to climate disasters last year, $1.47 was invested in the energy transition that will help prevent future damage, according to BNEF. Two decades ago, just 12 cents were spent for each dollar lost to climate disasters.

Total global investment in the energy transition from planet-heating fossil fuels hit $2.1 trillion last year, according to BNEF, a record that could be broken this year. Investments in wind, solar and other renewable-energy sources alone hit a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, with a 36 percent pullback in the U.S. from the second half of 2024 more than offset by a 63 percent jump in Europe.

Mainland China, meanwhile, has accounted for half of the world’s investment in renewables so far this year. As much as Trump crows about energy dominance, his crusade against wind and solar is ceding global energy dominance to China, and geopolitical influence along with it. While Gates muses about raising living standards in developing Africa with AI-enabled phones and GMO seeds, China is already doing it with inexpensive solar panels.

It behooves me to point out that coal-mining stocks have also boomed in the past five years. For all its green spending, China still relies too much on coal and shows no sign of losing its appetite. But the costs of running coal power plants keep rising, while solar and wind get cheaper.

Little wonder that, for the first time ever, renewables generated more of the world’s electricity than coal in the first half of 2025, according to the think tank Ember. If climate concerns aren’t enough to kill coal in the long run, then economics will.

Niall Smith, a quantitative researcher at Bloomberg, recently split some risk-premium atoms and discovered that companies with higher climate exposure also had higher capital costs. This may not be as splashy as the index charts above, but it’s still more evidence that, for all the climate-change denialism in our discourse these days, markets are still grounded in reality.

The move comes as the company plans to reduce reliance on components produced in China amid deteriorating US–China ties.

According to sources, Tesla decided earlier this year to stop using China-based suppliers for US-assembled cars.

Some China-made parts have already been replaced with components manufactured in other countries, and Tesla plans to move remaining components off China-origin supply within the next two years, the sources said.

The shift follows disruptions that began with the Covid-19 pandemic, which exposed vulnerabilities in parts flows from China.

Several China-based suppliers were prompted to relocate production to other countries, including Mexico.

The approach picked up pace this year after US President Donald Trump imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, increasing uncertainty.

Recent geopolitical frictions have further complicated access to certain items.

In particular, tensions between China and the Netherlands led to fresh disruptions in chip supplies, and earlier in the year China imposed export restrictions on some rare earths and magnets used in vehicles.

Tesla’s global production footprint is split.

Vehicles for the US market are built at its US factories using local supply chains, while cars produced at its Shanghai plant rely primarily on locally made parts.

Shanghai-manufactured cars are shipped within China and to markets in Asia and Europe, except the US.

Many Chinese vendors have supplied parts to Tesla assembly plants beyond China.

The Shanghai factory alone worked with roughly 400 direct Chinese suppliers, over 60 of which provided components for Tesla’s global production.

Known substitution challenges remain. Lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) have been an important input.

Tesla sold US vehicles with Chinese-produced LFP batteries until last year, but those batteries are no longer qualified for specific EV tax credits and were subject to US tariffs, prompting the company to stop using them in US cars.

Tesla is pursuing domestic LFP production for its energy-storage business and has said it anticipates a Nevada facility to begin making such battery products in the first quarter of 2026.

In April, Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said that the company is working to produce LFP cells in the US and to secure additional suppliers outside China, while acknowledging the transition “will take time.”",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/11/JA-shutterstock_2608036743.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 06:59:24.109962

This investment is one of the company’s largest state-level investment commitments to date. The investment highlights Google’s long-term confidence in Texas as a major hub for technology, clean energy, and data infrastructure.

Google’s CEO said that Google has proudly considered Texas a home for more than 15 years. This new expansion shows how important the state has become in Google’s broader strategy, especially as demand for artificial intelligence and cloud services continues to surge worldwide.

New Data Centers Across the State:

A major portion of the investment from Google will going towards building three new data center campuses. These new facilities will power Google’s growing AI operations, store enormous amounts of data, and handle advanced computing tasks.

The new campuses will be spread across different Texas counties and are expected to play a key role in building the next generation of AI applications. With AI models becoming larger and more complex, Google says adding new data centers is essential to ensuring reliable and fast services for users across the U.S.

Focus on Clean Energy and Local Workforce:

Google’s investment in Texas will not limited to technology infrastructure. The company is also committing funds toward clean energy projects and skills development programs within Texas.

Moreover, a major part of the investment plan includes support for new solar and battery storage initiatives to help power the data centers sustainably. This move shows Google’s broader goal of operating all of its facilities on clean energy in the coming years.

Google is also partnering with training organizations to support the development of more electricians and technical workers in Texas. By 2030, Google aims to help train more than a thousand electrical apprentices, strengthening the local workforce and preparing it for jobs in the fast-growing tech energy sector.

Why Texas?

Texas has emerged as a preferred destination for major tech companies not only Google in recent times. This is because of its large land availability, strong energy resources, and business-friendly environment. The state’s rapid growth in technology and clean energy makes it an ideal location for companies investing in next-generation infrastructure.

A Step Toward America’s AI Future:

Google’s 40 billion dollar plan shows how critical Texas will be in shaping the future of cloud computing and artificial intelligence in the United States.

After decades of stagnant consumption, U.S. energy demand is accelerating, and wind and solar continue to outperform gas and coal on cost. However, ideal land for solar installations often overlaps with active farmland, creating land-use challenges in many rural regions.

Agrivoltaics Offers Dual Benefits

Agrivoltaics, the dual-use model that pairs solar generation with active farming on the same land, presents a solution that benefits multiple stakeholders:

-Landowners gain predictable revenue while keeping farmland productive.

-Developers secure viable solar sites with fewer permitting conflicts.

-Communities retain agricultural activity while benefiting from tax revenue and local investment.

“Agrivoltaics demonstrates that agricultural production and solar development can be complementary rather than competing options for land use,” said Asher Salkin, former research intern at IEEFA and author of the report. “Our research shows that using agrivoltaics in agricultural settings increases crop yields in water-stressed regions, which not only lowers operating costs but also improves soil and ecosystem health.”

Market Growth and Potential

Although still emerging, agrivoltaics deployment in the U.S. has expanded significantly. Installed capacity has grown from 4.5 GW across 27,000 acres in 2020 to 10 GW across more than 62,000 acres in 2024, enough to power 1.5 million homes.

IEEFA notes that with the right policy support, agrivoltaics could:

-Aid small and midsize farmers

-Help meet rising national electricity demand

-Broaden rural participation in the clean energy transition

With U.S. power needs increasing and the economics of renewables remaining strong, agrivoltaics offers a path that aligns agricultural productivity with clean energy expansion.

“Large-scale battery energy storage has emerged as the most immediate … solution to enable AI factory deployment.”","RIDGEVILLE — A Lowcountry recycling plant described as South Carolina's single-largest economic development deal is powering up.

Redwoods Materials announced that an undisclosed number of workers have started extracting cobalt, copper, nickel and other critical minerals from discarded lithium-ion batteries at its 600-acre tract near the Volvo Cars factory in lower Berkeley County.

""This is a small but significant start toward what will become one of the world’s largest recovery, refining, and manufacturing campuses,"" the Nevada-based company said in a written statement.

Redwood plans to invest $3.5 billion and eventually create 1,500 jobs at its emerging Ridgeville site. It broke ground in early 2024, stating at the time that it ""will continue building and expanding the campus over the next decade.""

The company's overarching goal is to displace China as the go-to domestic supplier of minerals and materials the U.S. companies need to build electric vehicles and other products.

Redwood said it took in about 90 percent of all lithium-ion batteries processed in North America at its Nevada location last year, yielding more than 60,000 metric tons of reusable metals.

The East Coast operation in Camp Hall Commerce Park is expected to increase that figure by about a third.

The new plant originally was set to make anode copper foil. one of the main components in a battery cell, but Redwood has scuttled the idea, according to a Nov. 6 report by Bloomberg News.

The privately held company was launched in 2017 by JB Straubel, a Tesla co-founder and its former chief technology officer.

He's struck partnership deals with some of the biggest names in the automotive and battery businesses, including Ford Motor Co., Toyota and Panasonic.

Straubel and Redwood have been pivoting this year by seeking customers beyond the EV industry for its recycled minerals. The change is tied to the slowdown in sales, which accelerated after the Trump administration stopped offering federal tax credits to electric-vehicle buyers in September.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel told Bloomberg.

The defense industry is one likely key customer, along with data-center builders and electric utilities.

""The same critical minerals that power batteries also underpin the technologies that keep the nation running and secure,"" Redwood said in its statement last week. ""Nickel and cobalt are also essential for aerospace and defense alloys, while copper forms the backbone of industrial wiring and power transmission.""

At the same time, Redwood is extending its reach into the large-scale energy-storage field as the artificial-intelligence craze and a proliferation of power-hungry server farms test U.S. electric grids.

Ever since he moved to the city, he’s noticed an oddly large presence of a plant that is thousands of miles away from its native, tropical home — bamboo.

“There's a large thicket within walking distance of where I live. And then I've also noticed that in people's backyards, especially in the older neighborhoods, they have bamboo,"" Salim said. ""I go to somebody's house, go out back and there's a bunch of bamboo. So the question is, why is there so much bamboo in High Point?”

For this edition of Carolina Curious, WFDD’s Amy Diaz spoke with Margaret Fields, with the North Carolina chapter of the Nature Conservancy, to find the answer.

Landscaping trends

It makes sense that Salim is bewildered by the amount of bamboo in High Point. The plant is mostly native to Asia, so how did it get all the way to North Carolina?

Fields says bamboo was introduced to the United States over a long period of time, largely for commercial and decorative purposes. And it’s actually found all over the country.

“In the 20th century, there got to be a lot more plants being imported for use in people's landscaping. I had a bamboo ... in my yard that was planted there in the '50s,"" Fields said. ""So I feel like there are eras where it's in style to plant something. Like in the 80s, planting Bradford Pears and then figuring out over time, ‘This is a tree that doesn't last. And it also seeds out into the woods.' You can see in landscaping, kind of trends like that. And I think of bamboo as a '50s trend.”

That might explain why Salim notices so much bamboo in the historic neighborhoods. But bamboo doesn’t just stay where it’s planted. Fields says it's an invasive species, and spreads incredibly quickly.

Invasive species

“If they're not in a container, they will send out runners, send out rhizomes, and they can grow and spread 15 feet a year if we have a rainy summer,"" Fields said. ""And so people will plant these as a screen between them and their neighbor or them and the busy road, and if they don't put in a root barrier that goes down at least 18 inches, then the bamboo will just keep spreading.”

It also outcompetes the other native plants, which displaces them. And once it starts spreading, Fields says it’s really hard to stop.

“You have to basically devote a lot of resources to cutting it down, getting it to a mowable stage, where you can mow it and you can treat it with chemical but you mainly need to starve it of that sunlight,"" Fields said. ""And so it eventually will die, but that is years of managing it and chopping it and mowing it. It is doable. But it takes a commitment beyond just getting a landscaping crew to go out once and chop it down.”

Finding a native alternative

Fields deals with invasive species issues as part of her job with The Nature Conservancy. She’s also on the board of the North Carolina Invasive Plant Council.

She says people should research the plants they’re interested in buying before sticking them in the ground and potentially making an invasive species problem worse.

“You know, we've got the legacy of things like English ivy and things that are still sold in nurseries, and now we have them in the woods,"" Fields said. ""So it's good to educate yourself about what you want in the yard and seek out knowledgeable folks to get the plants from.”

But if you like the look of bamboo, Fields says there’s a native option. It's called giant cane, or river cane.

As of August 2025, there were 86 commercial surface waste disposal facilities permitted by the Railroad Commission.
In Texas, oilfield waste sites must certify only that they do not accept waste containing naturally occurring radioactive material, which can be present in some fracking waste.
The Texas Railroad Commission itself does not track what proportion of waste comes from out of state.
Across the state, in the Permian Basin, waste sites are known to accept drilling waste from neighboring New Mexico.","Editor’s Note: This story is a collaboration between the Texas Observer and Inside Climate News.

Peter Aldhous contributed data analysis for this story.

For 15 years, Debrah Linn and her children have raised chickens, miniature donkeys, pet geese, and, more recently, longhorn cattle on what she’d considered an idyllic and peaceful farmette near the village of Elysian Fields.

Her kids ride horses on their shady lane, a 4.3-mile-long country road that undulates through woods filled with standing water that feeds Sacogee Creek and, in summer, waving blossoms of Black-eyed Susans.

A few doors down, Bonnie and Robert Arbuckle, a couple from Shreveport, Louisiana, have kept busy over the last year roughing out their own do-it-yourself retirement dream house on pastureland with a pond stocked with catfish and bass. Waskom-Elysian Fields Road in Harrison County, deep in Northeast Texas, is so quiet that it’s long been used for training by cross-country runners from the high school near its point of origin.

So it attracted curiosity—and concern—when what initially seemed like an oversize pond grew into an enormous wall of dirt on a patch of wetlands across from the Arbuckles’ place. Unbeknownst to them and other locals, the Texas Railroad Commission had already issued a permit to allow the largest oil and gas waste disposal site in the region to be erected on their country road.

Soon, the Arbuckles could see mounds rising and hear the roars of a fleet of dump trucks, cranes, and other heavy construction equipment on that previously undeveloped acreage. And when Bonnie, a U.S. Army vet who knows a thing or two about excavation, introduced herself to the acting site supervisor, she got no answers. “He was friendly and came over,” she recalled. “But then when we started asking questions about what the operation was, it was just closed lips.”

The developer of this massive oilfield waste disposal site sent notices only to adjacent landowners—mostly unoccupied land with absentee owners, including the Texas General Land Office. A legal ad in a nearby small newspaper offered no details and didn’t mention Elysian Fields. These were the only notices required by the Railroad Commission, the state agency that regulates Texas’ oil and gas activities, including its toxic waste disposal.

Linn and others learned of the project only after the fact when Harrison County Judge Chad Sims, an Elysian Fields native, gathered locals at the village’s volunteer fire department in January.

Records show that a company called M2T, LLC., with a mailing address in faraway Montana, had initially applied for a Railroad Commission permit in January 2022 to handle what is described as “nonhazardous” oil and gas wastes on the 187-acre site. It had been approved in 2023 with no hearing and no local comments.

But Sims told residents who gathered inside the village fire department that he had recently learned that the out-of-state developer was tied to a Longview, Texas, company called McBride Operating LLC, which had already drawn scrutiny and complaints over its existing waste-handling operations in the nearby town of Waskom. Residents were shocked to learn from Sims that the Railroad Commission had, before anyone knew enough to formally protest, already approved this large new waste site on the same Waskom-Elysian Fields road where Sims’ daughter and other high school cross-country runners regularly practiced.

In 2019, McBride Operating had obtained a five-year permit from the Railroad Commission to operate the waste-handling center in Waskom, on an industrial site on the frontage road along Interstate 20, about 5 miles north of the Elysian Fields construction site. McBride Operating’s permit for Waskom expired in mid-2024. The commission staff then declined to renew it this February—a rare action by the pro-business agency. The denial came, records show, after the company had ignored instructions by agency employees and committed dozens of violations of state rules, including unauthorized construction and expansion, unauthorized waste disposal, and evidence of ongoing groundwater contamination.

McBride Operating never stopped running the Waskom site, even after the commission pulled its permit in February. It was able to do so because the company appealed.

Earlier this year, Linn began regularly driving her trusty Suburban SUV by the existing McBride waste site in Waskom to survey what might be coming to Elysian Fields. She worried even more about the excavation on her road after hearing Waskom residents complain that they could smell the operation from as far as 2 miles away. “Now the people that live closer, they have been complaining of headaches, nausea, things like that,” she said during one recent visit. “So that’s what my big worry is because my daughter has asthma and she struggles a lot with that. And I don’t want to be run out of my home by someone who doesn’t … play by the rules.”

Some complained about the odors to the Railroad Commission. McBride’s operations manager, Carrie Dowden, admitted as part of a deposition in a lawsuit filed by an employee who was overcome by chemical fumes that the company “can’t control the smell.” In a response to this report, a company spokesperson noted that McBride has never been fined for odors and that other businesses contribute to smells in the town.

Even as McBride Operating negotiated to stay open in Waskom, and pursued its options in Elysian Fields, the company had been simultaneously fighting other local opponents to secure a permit for another oilfield waste landfill 50 miles south near the town of Paxton, on a proposed site near wells that supply public drinking water.

But the massive Elysian Fields project would be McBride’s largest yet.

Linn soon found herself joining a growing and eclectic group of East Texans—including folks who consider themselves pro-oil and gas—who banded together to fight McBride’s expansions in Elysian Fields and Paxton and its efforts to continue in Waskom. Her allies included local teachers, a pastor who doubles as a rural water official, and a pair of ranchers.

Cattleman Terry Allen was fighting a court battle to halt McBride’s plans for Paxton. In Waskom, an octogenarian rancher named Jerry Cargill was pursuing all legal avenues to get McBride shut down. Both men traveled back and forth to Austin to appeal to the Railroad Commission, state legislators, and anyone who might listen.

Linn, tied down by family obligations and the need to tend farm animals, got on her computer and used her considerable research skills to dig—discovering quickly that McBride had racked up many more violations than other active oil and gas waste pit operators in East Texas. She wondered why there were so many waste pits in her area, right along the Louisiana state line.

Everyone worried that the litany of violations at Waskom, a site that had previously been an industrial area, would be repeated on pristine flood-prone acreage in Paxton and Elysian Fields. But their concerns gained little traction with decision-makers in Austin, and some were shocked when the only elected Railroad Commissioner from East Texas, Wayne Christian, who’d initially seemed friendly to their arguments, began advocating for McBride.

Christian defended McBride, stating that more waste disposal capacity was urgently needed in Northeast Texas, part of the Haynesville-Bossier Shale, which runs into northwest Louisiana. It follows the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and the Permian Basin in West Texas as the third-most-productive natural gas basin in the country.

But Linn and others swear they spotted many trucks with Louisiana plates unloading fracking waste at McBride’s facility—and fear their rural communities were becoming dumping grounds for the neighboring state. Linn figured it was no coincidence that two new proposed pits in Paxton and Elysian Fields were only minutes from the state line. “If we didn’t have the Louisiana business, would these [facilities] even be here?” Linn said. “I don’t think they would.”

Oil and gas wells produce prodigious amounts of waste. One horizontal well generates upwards of 8,000 barrels—or 336,000 gallons—of waste during the drilling and completion process, according to the Texas company Milestone Environmental. As oil and gas production soared to record highs in Texas, the industry needed more capacity to dispose of all the waste. Disposal wells and landfills opened and expanded from the Permian Basin to the Haynesville Shale.

As of August 2025, there were 86 commercial surface waste disposal facilities permitted by the Railroad Commission. Six of those are in the agency’s East Texas District 6, headquartered in Henderson. Some facilities, like the one in Waskom, separate solid and liquid waste. Much of the liquid waste is injected underground in disposal wells. The solid waste, which includes drill cuttings and muds, is permanently buried in pits or commercial landfills.

That waste can contain benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and other harmful constituents. But industry lobbyists succeeded in classifying this waste as nonhazardous under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

McBride’s Waskom facility currently separates and sends solid waste to an industrial landfill in Mount Pleasant. The liquid waste is injected into a disposal well on-site. The McBride landfills planned for Paxton and Elysian Fields could accept the waste that is currently sent to Mount Pleasant.

By the time Linn and others first learned about the company’s permitted plans for Elysian Fields in early 2025, Cargill had already been fighting McBride’s Waskom facility in the Railroad Commission’s administrative law courts for years.

Cargill, 82, grew up 20 miles away in Marshall, the county seat, while making frequent visits to the ranch his grandparents owned outside Waskom. In the 1980s, he bought out his relatives to become the sole owner of the 600-plus-acre property. After retiring from a long career in beverage sales, Cargill now lives on the ranch. He took notice of McBride soon after the site in Waskom opened, in 2020.

Cargill watched with concern as heavy trucks barreled down the highway to McBride, where they loaded and unloaded wastewater and solids. Cargill had flown drones over the site and observed how heavy rainfall would wash runoff from the waste stored on-site toward his property. He worried that two nearby creeks—Big Sis and Little Sis—could become conduits for pollution to reach his land. Cargill declined to be interviewed for this story but made his sentiments clear in statements to the commission and in documents filed by his attorneys.

For years, McBride accumulated violations during Railroad Commission inspections. Regulators issued 68 violations during the company’s first five years of operations in Waskom (2020 through 2024). Many violations were for disposal of solid oil and gas waste in pits that McBride built but were not authorized in its permit, and failure to comply with the permit. The facility was also added to the commission’s Operator Cleanup Program, which manages complex environmental remediation cases, after groundwater contamination was found on-site. Inspection reports found leaking tanks of produced water and waste piled on the ground outside the pits.

Despite dozens of violations, the Railroad Commission fined McBride only once in this five-year period: a $668 penalty issued in November 2024 for a spill that occurred in 2023. Inspectors found that the spill of extremely salty produced water had traveled more than 300 feet in the direction of a creek.

Company spokesperson Charlie Rose said that many of these violations of “unpermitted” disposal fell under a “catchall” category in the Railroad Commission rules that “includes any violation of a permit provision under which a commercial waste management facility operates.

“Of the referenced violations, all but one were resolved immediately upon reinspection. The single exception occurred during our first year of operation and involved a spill incident that required follow-up,” Rose said. “In every case, we responded promptly and effectively.”

Railroad Commission spokesperson Bryce Dubee said that McBride, like other operators, is given an opportunity to address violations before it is referred to legal enforcement.

Meanwhile, other government regulators were uncovering problems at McBride.

On the night of February 6, 2024, Pedro Julian Garcia died in a workplace accident at McBride’s Waskom site. Garcia, a 26-year-old father of two, was fixing a leaking pump when the valve blew off, fatally striking him in the chest. McBride had no written procedures for repairing hazardous electrical equipment, like the pump, and its employees had no training to perform such tasks, according to an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation.

OSHA, the federal agency that enforces workplace safety laws, had never previously inspected the McBride site. It ultimately fined the company $32,264 for 12 violations. McBride later settled a lawsuit with Garcia’s family.

A lawsuit filed by Jaire Jackson, a worker injured in 2021 while cleaning one of McBride’s tanks, uncovered other issues at the site. In a 2022 deposition, Dowden, the operations manager, said that she’d previously worked as a bartender and had no prior oilfield experience when she was hired as a supervisor. She described her office as a “mess,” said workers were not provided with protective gear, and claimed she did not know if there was any operating manual for the site.

Rose said that the company’s safety program has been expanded in recent years and that every employee undergoes extensive training.

Cargill formally protested McBride’s permit renewal when the application was filed in 2024. Evidence to support the protest would come later. First, the Railroad Commission would have to determine whether Cargill had legal standing to protest the permit. If he was found to have standing, a full hearing would be scheduled before a Railroad Commission administrative law judge.

In February 2025, Cargill filed a separate complaint with the Railroad Commission, asking for a hearing in which McBride would have to show why its permit should be renewed and not canceled. The complaint filing contended that McBride had consistently violated statewide rules for oil and gas waste, that groundwater had been contaminated at the site, and that contamination had not been remediated.

“Mr. Cargill’s claims are part of a seemingly coordinated effort that has now expanded to the media,” Rose said when asked about those complaints.

Cargill was not the only party to protest renewal when McBride’s first five-year permit was set to expire, on July 30, 2024. Other local landowners and the City of Waskom filed their own protests too. In February 2025, it seemed as though they’d won a victory: A letter from the commission’s technical permitting division laid out numerous ways McBride had violated the terms of its first permit, denied the permit renewal, and ordered the facility to shut down.

“Commission staff has attempted to work with the operator to address these concerns,” Railroad Commission engineer Alisa Patterson wrote. “However, after several meetings and a series of request[s] for additional data (RAD) letters, staff concludes that the amendment and renewal permit application cannot be approved.”

Cargill, still building his case against McBride, thought his concerns were finally being heard.

But McBride’s attorney, John Hicks, appealed the permit rejection, which, under commission rules, allowed McBride to continue its operations while the appeals process proceeded. During a June visit, its truckers’ lounge and loading docks were bustling with activity, as rumbling trucks came and went from the stretch of Interstate 20 that leads to Louisiana, only a few minutes east of the site.

Both sides prepared for a July 31 prehearing before a Railroad Commission administrative law judge to hear the merits of Cargill’s permit protest and complaint. Cargill’s lawyers would argue why he should be granted standing to protest the permit renewal. Hicks would argue why the facility should stay open and why Cargill was undeserving of standing in the administrative court.

Then, less than 24 hours before the prehearing was set to begin, a Railroad Commission lawyer notified the legal teams that the agency had settled with McBride. The two-paragraph notice retracted the denial and gave McBride 90 days to submit engineering plans to resolve the outstanding problems and continue operating.

Nonetheless, the legal teams arrived at the Railroad Commission hearing room in Austin the next morning. Attorneys George Neale and Charles Zhang, representing Cargill, argued that McBride had already been given more than enough time to resolve the numerous rule violations. They pointed out that after the site was added to the Railroad Commission’s cleanup program in 2021, it took McBride four years to submit a cleanup plan.

“[McBride] is one of, if not the worst, operators in the state of Texas,” Zhang said. “They’ve had four years of second chances.”

But Hicks argued that Cargill’s complaints were “entirely inappropriate” and circumvented the Railroad Commission’s existing protocols.

Cargill watched the proceedings with anxious attentiveness, nervously clicking a pen. He took the stand after lunch and implored the Railroad Commission to rein in McBride, saying he felt a duty to report the violations he had observed. He told the judge that he thought Joseph McBride, the Longview entrepreneur who formed McBride Operating in 2013, was “stalling because he wants to open his next landfill,” echoing a theory posited by other East Texans.

“This isn’t the way to run a business. … They’re playing games with our environment,” Cargill said. “If someone does something wrong, why would you give him five years to fix that?”

Given that the Railroad Commission had reached a settlement the day before, Cargill knew the agency would reconsider the permit application and the progress he had achieved could slip away. He had driven five hours from his ranch to Austin. On the way home, he would stop at a Dallas doctor’s office for a heart checkup.

His lawyers withdrew the complaint asking for a “show cause” hearing in September. At that time, the administrative law judge had not yet ruled on whether Cargill would be given standing to protest the permit renewal.

In September, Rose said the company had already submitted “preliminary proposals” as part of the settlement and is “working through finalizing the detailed engineering documents.” He said the company cannot disclose the specifics but is “committed to full transparency and compliance.”

In an email, Dubee, the Railroad Commission spokesperson, said that if agency staff is not “satisfied these remedies will be implemented,” the matter can be denied and the permit sent back again for another hearing.

Cargill and Linn both fretted that McBride was simply using lawyers to buy time until the Elysian Fields facility could open. The Railroad Commission staff had already found McBride’s stormwater plans in Waskom to be insufficient to protect ground and surface water. In the low-lying Elysian Fields construction site, Linn foresaw worse problems. The construction site, part of the headwaters of Sacogee Creek, was full of standing water when a local television crew went out to film in January. Residents worry that once the pits are filled with heaping piles of chemical-laden waste, runoff or flooding could contaminate local waterways.

In responses for this story, Rose said the company has designed a stormwater system for the site’s specific terrain that includes elevated containment and retention features that would prevent water from the site from reaching nearby estuaries.

Environmental advocates point to how pollution from oilfield waste landfills in areas like Western Pennsylvania have fouled local creeks and raised health concerns among residents. “When you dispose of drill cuttings in a landfill and it rains, it’s going to take all of the contaminants and soak through the whole landfill like a tea,” said Matt Kelso, of the nonprofit organization FracTracker Alliance, based in Pennsylvania.

The Paxton, Elysian Fields, and Waskom sites are all in low-lying areas minutes from the Louisiana state line. Though East Texas produces plenty of its own oil and gas waste, records show that many of the pits in the region have been profiting by accepting chemicals, mud, and other byproducts from Louisiana oil and gas operators.

Louisiana does not have any solid oilfield waste disposal facilities in the Haynesville-Bossier Shale, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Louisiana also has stronger regulations for injection wells that accept liquid waste from oil and gas fields. Louisiana requires that the waste be tested and logs recorded for injection well sites. In Texas, oilfield waste sites must certify only that they do not accept waste containing naturally occurring radioactive material, which can be present in some fracking waste. (Additional testing is required only for substances not exempted from federal hazardous waste rules.)

The Texas Railroad Commission itself does not track what proportion of waste comes from out of state. For this story, Inside Climate News analyzed quarterly reports made to the Railroad Commission by five waste facilities in East Texas between 2022 and 2024. Three reported accepting waste from Louisiana. Charles Holston, Inc., in Center, Texas, reported that three-quarters of the waste it accepted came from Louisiana. More than half the waste processed at the Top Cat Truck Wash in Panola County came from Louisiana. Across the state, in the Permian Basin, waste sites are known to accept drilling waste from neighboring New Mexico.

McBride’s quarterly reports from that period indicate waste arriving at the Waskom facility came from Texas. But Rose noted that those reports do not include liquid waste directly injected into two wells there. He said that both the Waskom and Elysian Fields facilities can accept waste from any operator that meets Texas regulations, including Louisiana sites.

“New Mexico and Louisiana have recognized the danger of this waste,” said Terry Allen, the cattleman who’s fighting another McBride project in the town of Paxton. “They’re making Texas the dumping ground.”

For more than four years, McBride’s proposal to build yet another waste pit 50 miles south of Waskom near the village of Paxton was blocked—temporarily at least—by the Railroad Commission. Two different administrative law judges ruled that the application should be denied in part because of evidence provided by Allen and by a rural water company that the site could compromise wells only 1,200 feet away that provide a significant amount of the county’s water supply.

“This is our aquifer. This is where we get our drinking water from,” said Eric Garrett, who runs Paxton Water. For him, the risks of even a tiny bit of poison seeping into those wells was too high.

But ultimately, the final decision would go to a vote by the three railroad commissioners, who are all elected Republicans. Paxton community members hoped that Christian, a former state representative from Center, would listen to the concerns of his Shelby County neighbors and oppose the permit.

When the vote came in January 2025, Commissioner Jim Wright, who owns oilfield waste companies, and Commissioner Christian voted to issue the permit. They overruled Commissioner Christi Craddick, the sole vote in opposition. All three commissioners have accepted campaign contributions. From 2020 to 2025, McBride and McBride Operating contributed more than $90,000 to the three commissioners, including recent contributions to Craddick’s campaign for state comptroller. At the same time, the company plowed between $336,000 and $778,000 into lobbying, records show.

In an emailed statement, Wright said that feedback received through the hearings resulted in additional safeguards to address local residents’ concerns. He also said there is a “significant lack” of permitted oilfield waste disposal in East Texas.

In a statement for this story, Christian said the project would bring “real paychecks, tax revenue for our schools and roads, and a chance to bring life back to communities that have been left behind.

“Rural Texas has been losing jobs and families for decades, and we can’t afford to turn away investment,” he added.

Christian previously wrote a letter to the Light and Champion newspaper in Center to explain his vote. “The idea that this project could have simply been blocked because it is in my local county is a misunderstanding of the law,” he wrote. “If a company meets the legal requirements, we cannot arbitrarily deny a permit.”

He also claimed that opposition to the permit was pushed by outside groups with “radical, anti-energy policies.” Much of the opposition “around this permit hasn’t come from landowners—it’s been manufactured by professional activist groups from outside our region,” he wrote.

Garrett, of Paxton Water, had a different view. “What is totally baffling to me is that despite the recommendations of their own people, Commissioner Wright and Commissioner Christian felt like they knew better than their own staff,” he told the Observer. “How do you explain that?”

Linn wrote her own letter to the paper. She argued that the only outside interests involved were the Louisiana oil and gas companies that would get to dump their waste in Texas. “The protection of our water is non-negotiable and not a partisan issue,” she wrote. “Why are Texas taxpayers liable for other states’ toxic waste?”

Allen is relieved that, for now, McBride has not started construction in his town, but he has continued to fight the company on other fronts.

It’s possible that all that waste will now arrive in Elysian Fields, where some local residents and the village’s high school and elementary school depend on groundwater wells within a few miles of the landfill, according to the county judge and other local residents.

McBride’s spokesperson said that construction at Elysian Fields is “nearing completion” and that the site will begin accepting waste “once every safety and environmental measure is fully in place.”

By September, Linn said she’d already seen more trucks making deliveries to the site, where plastic pieces of what look like a liner have been lying out in the sun for months. In an email, Rose confirmed that a liner had been delivered but said operations have not yet begun. He said there’s no estimated construction date for Paxton.

Allen’s experience challenging the permit has motivated him, along with Linn and others, to advocate for changes to Texas laws governing oilfield waste. Allen traveled to the state Capitol in April to testify before the House Energy Resources Committee on two bills that would, respectively, require companies to notify landowners before burying oil and gas waste and demonstrate the necessity of a commercial oil and gas landfill when applying for a permit. He urged lawmakers to consider the compliance history of operators that are applying for new permits.

State Representative Jay Dean, whose district includes Waskom and Longview, responded to Allen’s comments and said that McBride has a way of “eluding” regulators. “If you’re going to be in that business—the rules, regulations, processes—you need to follow them, and nobody should get an exception,” he said.

Linn and Allen are working to found an organization called Texas Legacy Defense to assist communities, so far with members from Shelby, Panola, Harrison counties. “Because no one is listening,” Linn said. They like to say the group began when a “retired banker, a pastor, an editor, and a nurse walked into a room. It might sound like the setup to a joke, but that’s actually how Texas Legacy Defense began—in the fellowship room of a little country church.”

Allen bristles at the suggestion that outside interest groups are backing the movement against McBride. “I can tell you unequivocally that there have been no outside funds from any outside interests,” he said. “It’s all from people who are concerned that our groundwater, our land, and our air will be contaminated from this rogue operator.”

To drive home the point, Allen paid to hang banners in Shelby County calling Christian and Wright “Proven Liars.” In an email, Wright’s spokesperson disagreed: “Chairman Wright may be a lot of things, but a liar isn’t one of them.”

The East Texas waste dumps remain flash points for the growing number of Texans voicing their discontent with the Railroad Commission. Commissioner Wright is up for reelection in 2026. One of the first contenders to announce a campaign was Hawkins “Hawk” Dunlap, himself a native of East Texas and a longtime oilfield firefighter.

“Today, we get some 40 per cent electricity from nuclear, but we also currently get another 40 per cent from coal.
Opposition to nuclear energy While atomic energy enjoys public support, sceptical voices can be heard at home and abroad.
The Dukovany and Temelín plants are located near the border with Austria, which abandoned nuclear energy after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear explosion.","The eight huge cooling towers of the Dukovany power plant overlook a construction site for two more reactors as Czechia pushes ahead with plans to expand its reliance on nuclear energy.

Mobile drilling rigs have been extracting samples 140 metres below ground for a geological survey to make sure the site is suitable for a $19 billion (€16.4 billion) project as part of the expansion that should eventually at least double the country’s nuclear output and cement its place among Europe’s most nuclear-dependent nations.

South Korea’s KHNP beat France’s EDF in a tender to construct a new plant whose two reactors will have an output of over 1,000 megawatts each. After becoming operational in the second half 2030s, they will complement Dukovany’s four 512-MW reactors that date from the 1980s.

The KHNP deal gives the Czechs an option to have two more units built at the other nuclear plant in Temelín, which currently has two 1,000-megawatt reactors.

Then, they are set to follow up with small modular nuclear reactors.

“Nuclear will generate between 50 per cent and 60 per cent (of energy) around 2050 in the Czechia, or maybe slightly more,"" Petr Závodský, chief executive of the Dukovany project, told The Associated Press in an interview.

The nuclear expansion is needed to help the country wean itself off fossil fuels, secure steady, reliable supplies at a reasonable price, meet low-emission requirements, and enable robust demand for electricity expected in the coming years to power data centres and electric cars, Závodský said.

Europe’s nuclear revival

The Czech expansion comes at a time when surging energy demand and looming deadlines by countries and companies to sharply cut carbon pollution are helping to revive interest in nuclear technology.

While nuclear power does produce waste, it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

The European Union has accepted nuclear energy by including it in the classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities, opening the door to financing. That has been a boost for Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary and France — the continent’s nuclear leader — that have heavily relied on nuclear.

Belgium and Sweden recently scrapped plans to phase out nuclear power. Denmark and Italy are reconsidering their use, while Poland is set to join a club of 12 nuclear-friendly nations in the European Union after signing a deal with US-based Westinghouse to build three nuclear units.

The EU generated 24 per cent of its electricity from nuclear electricity in 2024.

Britain signed a cooperation deal with the United States in September that Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said would lead to “a golden age of nuclear in this country.”

It will also invest £14.2 billion (€16.1 billion) to build the Sizewell C nuclear power plant, the first in the UK since 1995.

CEZ, the dominant Czech power company in which the government holds a 70 per cent stake, and Britain’s Rolls-Royce SMR have agreed on a strategic partnership to develop and deploy small modular nuclear reactors.

Money matters

The cost of the Dukovany project is estimated at over €16 billion, with the government agreeing to acquire an 80 per cent majority in the new plant.

The government will secure a loan for the new units that CEZ will repay over 30 years. The state will also guarantee a stable income from the electricity production for CEZ for 40 years. Approval is expected to be granted by the EU, which aims to become “climate-neutral” by 2050.

“We’re in a good position to argue that we won’t be able to do without new nuclear units,” Závodský said.

“Today, we get some 40 per cent electricity from nuclear, but we also currently get another 40 per cent from coal. It’s clear we have to replace the coal.”

Czechia is looking to phase out coal by 2033.

Uncertainty over financing has caused a significant delay in the nuclear expansion, however. In 2014, CEZ cancelled a tender to build two reactors at the existing Temelin nuclear plant after the government refused to provide financial guarantees.

Russia’s energy giant Rosatom and China’s CNG were excluded from the Dukovany tender on security grounds following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.

CEZ signed a deal with Westinghouse and France’s Framatome to supply nuclear fuel for its two nuclear plants, eliminating the country’s dependence on Russia. The contract with KHNP secures fuel supplies for 10 years.

Opposition to nuclear energy

While atomic energy enjoys public support, sceptical voices can be heard at home and abroad.

The Friends of the Earth say it is too costly, and the money could be better used for improving the industry. The country also still does not have a permanent storage facility for spent fuel.

The Dukovany and Temelín plants are located near the border with Austria, which abandoned nuclear energy after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear explosion.

Rivian is about to take a plunge in the affordable EV market with the R2, a midsize SUV with a starting price of around $45,000.

The model would bring the brand closer to what most Americans expect to pay for an EV. An existing Rivian R1 will cost you $70,000 and up. Deliveries are expected in the first half of next year.

Waymo is rolling out self-driving cabs in 3 more cities

While most people are still nervous about their own cars being fully self-driving, many Americans seem comfortable with driverless taxis.

Waymo has taken note, announcing it will bring autonomous cabs to Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego in 2026. That will bring the company to 12 cities with operational taxis.

Fast chargers are much more available than we think

We have more public chargers than ever, and yet Americans are still living with the fear of not being able to plug in when needed.

A new poll noted that despite 12,000 chargers being added within a mile of interstates and highways this year alone, around 40% of Americans still blame charging and range worries as major reasons they wouldn't consider buying an EV.

Ironically, the same poll shows that nearly 70% of interstate highways are within 10 miles of a fast charger. That's a rise of almost 10% in two years — and is more than double what it was in 2018-19.

The new financing brings Harbinger’s total capital raised to $358m.

Alongside the investment, FedEx has placed an initial order for 53 Harbinger vehicles.

The order covers Class 5 and Class 6 models intended to support the company’s higher-capacity pickup and delivery needs and its ongoing network modernisation.

Harbinger said it plans to begin shipping chassis ready for body upfit before the end of the calendar year.

FedEx safety and transportation senior vice president Paul Melander said: “As we work toward a goal to electrify the entire FedEx pickup and delivery fleet by 2040, this trifecta of performance, price, and operational resilience is what we need to be able to continue to scale.

“We look forward to bringing these Class 5 and 6 units into our fleet and seeing electric medium-duty trucking options—like what Harbinger is offering—become more accessible in the marketplace for commercial fleets of all sizes.”

Harbinger co-founder and CEO John Harris said: “Harbinger is driving the next generation of medium-duty electric vehicles with a clean-sheet platform designed for optimised fleet performance.

“The level of investor support we’ve received reflects strong belief in the practicality of our platform, and our order from FedEx demonstrates that this vision is already taking shape in the market.”

Harbinger develops an in-house “EV stripped chassis” platform in the US, integrating core vehicle systems to support a vertically integrated manufacturing approach that the company says helps manage costs.

The trucks are designed with a focus on suspension, handling and safety, and feature advanced driver assistance systems including dynamic-trajectory backup cameras, virtual bumpers and acoustic vehicle alerting systems.

The platform’s modular design supports battery configurations tailored to operational requirements, offering ranges from around 225km to more than 321km.

The company highlights acquisition costs positioned against comparable internal combustion models, as well as acceleration and steering suited to urban environments.

THOR Industries has previously collaborated with Harbinger in the recreational vehicle segment.

Data-center growth is not directly increasing costs in most regions yet, but in PJM, utility customers’ bills already reflect the capacity cost increases tied to serving future data centers.
The counterargument from data centers Data-center companies and utilities are not happy about mandatory power cutoffs for new computing facilities, however — and their arguments have so far carried the day at PJM.
But groups arguing for mandatory restrictions say these alternatives may not take effect quickly enough to prevent data-center growth from outpacing the capacity of PJM’s grid.
Meanwhile, PJM’s grid is only just beginning to feel the pressures of data-center expansion.","The data-center boom is pushing electricity costs to the breaking point for PJM Interconnection — the country’s biggest grid operator, serving more than 65 million people from the mid-Atlantic coast to Illinois — and that’s fueling a popular backlash.

Democratic gubernatorial candidates pledging to combat rising utility bills just won landslide victories in New Jersey and Virginia, two states bearing much of the brunt of data-center-driven cost increases. Congress members along with state governors and lawmakers are demanding that PJM take action.

PJM is poised to make a key decision this week on a fast-track process to get data centers online quickly while mitigating the impact of the facilities, which can use as much power as small cities. But a conflict has emerged over how far the grid operator can go. It boils down to this: Can PJM force data centers to stop using electricity at moments when demand for power peaks?

Data-center trade groups say no. But a growing number of politicians and environmental and consumer advocates say that requiring data centers to be the first to get disconnected from power during grid emergencies is the only surefire way to protect customers.

Last week, a bipartisan coalition of state legislators representing many of the 13 states served by PJM submitted its Protecting Ratepayers Proposal, which argues for data centers to be allowed to connect to PJM’s grid with the stipulation that they will be “‘interrupted’ during grid emergencies until they bring their own new supply.”

“We have a responsibility to ensure that technological growth doesn’t push vulnerable residents into financial hardship or enable a massive transfer of wealth from ratepayers to data centers,” said Maryland state Sen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat and organizer of the coalition, in a press release introducing the proposal.

“This proposal is about fairness and responsibility,” added Illinois state Sen. Rachel Ventura, also a Democrat. ​“We’re making sure data centers carry the cost of their own energy demands instead of passing it on to the public.”

That’s a salient concern, because the peak power needs of data centers are what’s driving electricity costs through the roof in PJM territory.

The grid operator must secure enough capacity from power plants and other resources to serve its peak loads. The prices of securing that capacity have skyrocketed in the past two years, from $2.2 billion in 2023 to $14.7 billion in 2024 and to $16.1 billion in PJM’s latest capacity auction this summer.

Growing demand forecasts of yet-to-be-built data centers are the primary culprit for these price spikes, and constitute the ​“core reliability issue facing PJM markets at present,” according to an August report from Monitoring Analytics, the company tasked with tracking PJM’s markets. ​“There is still time to address the issue but failure to do so will result in very high costs for other PJM customers,” the report warns.

Utility bills are rising across much of the U.S. due to a combination of factors, including volatile fossil-gas prices and the expense of repairing and expanding power grids. Data-center growth is not directly increasing costs in most regions yet, but in PJM, utility customers’ bills already reflect the capacity cost increases tied to serving future data centers.

Groups including consumer advocates in Maryland and the Natural Resources Defense Council agree that requiring new data centers to get cut off first during grid emergencies is a vital backstop to the suite of interventions PJM is considering for its fast-track process.

“We’re proposing to allow data centers to join PJM’s grid as fast as they want, but not guarantee them firm service, so they’ll be given interruptible service until they bring their own capacity,” Claire Lang-Ree, clean-energy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council and coauthor of the environmental group’s proposal, explained during an Oct. 22 webinar. ​“We think that’ll solve both the cost and reliability problem, because by removing all these large loads out of the capacity market until they bring their own supply, … capacity prices might go back down to historic levels.”

PJM’s Members Committee is expected to vote Wednesday on a final advisory recommendation to send to the grid operator’s board of managers. PJM has said it intends to file a proposal in December with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in hopes of gaining approval to institute changes in 2026.

The counterargument from data centers

Data-center companies and utilities are not happy about mandatory power cutoffs for new computing facilities, however — and their arguments have so far carried the day at PJM.

In August, PJM issued a ​“conceptual proposal” that included a ​“non-capacity-backed load” (NCBL) structure. The approach would force loads of 50 megawatts or larger to curtail power use to forestall grid emergencies as a precondition to interconnection.

That proposal was lambasted by the Data Center Coalition, a trade group that includes Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and dozens of other companies that own, operate, or lease data-center capacity. In comments to PJM, the coalition warned that by imposing NCBL status on data centers, the grid operator ​“risks exceeding its jurisdictional authority” over customer interconnection and interruptibility status, which are generally managed by utilities regulated at the state level.

“PJM has not provided a defensible rationale for creating this new class of service, and on its face the proposal is unduly discriminatory,” the coalition wrote.

PJM responded by pulling the NCBL concept from its next round of proposals, instead offering new data centers a voluntary method to commit to curtailing their peak power use through tweaks to a structure called ​“price-responsive demand,” or PRD.

As PJM explained in an October update, ​“With these changes, PRD becomes similar to voluntary NCBL,” since data centers that opt in would be exempt from paying for capacity but be obligated to ​“reduce demand during stressed system conditions.”

The big question is if data-center developers will choose to act at the scale required to ​“move the needle,” as analytics firm ClearView Energy Partners put it in a November research note. The authors wrote that, according to their observations in recent PJM meetings, ​“it’s far from clear whether new large load[s] would take service via this voluntary program.”

Consumer advocates aren’t happy with the data-center industry’s resistance to mandatory controls. Clara Summers, campaign manager for the Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois-based consumer-advocacy group, told Canary Media that the Data Center Coalition’s positions ​“are generally disappointing, given how some individual members of the DCC have shown a willingness to hammer out decent solutions that actually take responsibility for their own costs.”

Summers is referring to a handful of efforts by tech giants and data-center developers to use their own capacity resources to reduce their grid impacts. One such rare example is an agreement Google reached in August with PJM utility Indiana Michigan Power that commits the tech giant to bringing additional new capacity online and lowering power use during times of peak demand to alleviate the impacts of expanding a massive data center in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Running out of time

Most of the groups submitting proposals to PJM agree that its new rules should enable data centers to fast-track development by paying for generation and other capacity resources to serve their own needs. Stakeholders also agree that data centers that can use less power during times of peak demand should be rewarded for the relief that would provide to PJM’s system.

The Data Center Coalition has also won backing from the governors of Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, four states in PJM territory courting data centers for economic development. Those governors joined the coalition in submitting a proposal for the fast-track process that would task state regulators with expediting interconnection for data centers that can add enough new generation capacity to the grid to cover their energy demand at the time they are connected.

But groups arguing for mandatory restrictions say these alternatives may not take effect quickly enough to prevent data-center growth from outpacing the capacity of PJM’s grid.

PJM’s notoriously backlogged interconnection queue is impeding the addition of new power plants to the system. The grid operator’s efforts to fast-track new generation resources have yielded only a handful of projects expected to come online before 2030.

PJM is still in the early stages of developing options to add capacity to existing generators, such as pairing batteries with solar and wind farms. And proposals that let data-center developers tap into the flexibility of virtual power plants remain a work in progress.

Meanwhile, PJM’s grid is only just beginning to feel the pressures of data-center expansion. The latest forecasts of large-load growth across PJM territory show 32 gigawatts of additional demand by 2028 and about 60 gigawatts by 2030, or a 37% increase from PJM’s peak load today, according to the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, the state’s consumer advocate.

The sheer scale of proposed data-center construction beggars belief. To meet that projected demand, ​“by 2028, [developers] would have to be investing about $1 trillion within PJM in the next three to four years,” David Lapp, who leads the Maryland office, said during a press conference last month. ​“That’s an insane amount of money.”

But utilities, power-plant owners, data-center developers, and the tech giants spurring the AI boom have little reason to constrain these outsized growth plans, or to concede to restrictions on their peak power use, Lapp said. These are ​“some of the most powerful corporations in the world, all increasing their bottom line on the backs of existing customers,” he said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2226519693.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=e2c55853a2e7c6caefc6f36704301311,N,,2025-11-17 05:58:55.157994

Forged through the leadership of two no-nonsense politicians – President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi – the clear-eyed agreement abandons more than a decade of energy uncertainty that was marked by unpredictable supply chains, unrealistic net-zero pledges and overreliance on unreliable wind and solar energy. This rightly places energy and industrial strategy at the heart of protecting national sovereignty.

Facing the weaponization of supply chains by Beijing, which controls over 90% of processed rare earths, America’s deal with Japan makes priorities of access to materials and technology, strategic resilience and economic growth and leverages an existing $550 billion investment package between the two countries.

According to a White House fact sheet, Japan and various Japanese companies will invest up to $332 billion in U.S. energy infrastructure, including nuclear reactors, plus up to $50 billion in power equipment through deals involving both U.S. and Japanese companies. Japan reportedly is to have increased access to U.S. markets for technology sales and favorable tariff treatment.

These investments are not for more bird-slicing wind turbines or desert-smothering solar panels, but for practical, reliable electric-generating capability.

The U.S. is to spend $75 billion on data-center infrastructure from three Japanese companies: Mitsubishi Electric, for supply power station systems and equipment; TDK Corp., advanced electronic power components; and Fujikura, Ltd., optical fiber cables.

The U.S.-Japan agreement also includes a multi-year deal valued at over $100 million between Global Coal Sales Group and Tohoku Electric Power for American thermal coal. This is a rational decision by an advanced industrial nation to secure affordable, reliable electricity for its people. Coal remains an indispensable energy source for nations that refuse to sacrifice economic growth at the altar of “decarbonization” dogma.

The deal calls for a Japanese investment of up to $3 billion to construct an ammonia and urea fertilizer manufacturing facility in the United States and another $2 billion to construct a copper smelting and refining plant in the American West.

On the other side of the Pacific, Japan will bolster energy supplies by importing 66 million metric tons of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) each year, making it the second-largest LNG buyer after China.

Still, Japan would be well served to add further to provisions of the deal – such as JERA Co.’s $1.5 billion stake in natural gas assets in Louisiana's Haynesville shale deposits and Tokyo Gas's purchase of Alaska LNG – which help to replace strategically risky Russian supplies that account for 9% of Japan's gas needs.

As for nuclear power, Japan's political cowardice following the Fukushima disaster in 2011 has left it with only 14 of the country’s 54 pre-accident nuclear reactors restarted. Japan needs to exorcise the Fukushima ghosts that have frozen policymakers for 14 years and reclaim its edge in a field now dominated by China, France, South Korea and Russia.

Fortunately for Japan and others, America’s Trump administration has bulldozed a path for vigorous development of resources by ditching the Paris Accord's chains and axing funds for global climate polices that enforce energy poverty.

The U.S.-Japanese framework hammers home strategic resilience through partnerships with major firms like Mitsubishi and Toshiba embedding in American projects, engendering employment and trade and defying minimalist “green” delusions.

Both powers now stand armored against disruptions, their economies roaring on a bedrock of hydrocarbons and atomic might, proving that real strength comes from embracing what works, not cowering before fabricated crises.

""If I was buying a home and saw that natural gas was installed then I would pay to remove it,"" another Redditor shared.","Cities working to ditch dirty energy in new buildings are celebrating a big win. A federal judge recently upheld a New York City law that bans the use of methane gas in new construction.

In a Reddit post to r/Energy, one social media user shared a Grist article detailing the clean energy ruling.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed trade groups' lawsuit claiming that gas restrictions violated federal law. Pro-climate groups are hopeful that this case will reinvigorate local climate action by enforcing strict pollution limits from fuel burned in new buildings.

Laws like the one in New York could effectively ban gas stoves, gas water heaters, and gas furnaces. Therefore, developers would need to equip and install clean energy alternatives such as heat pumps and induction cooktops.

With this legal precedent, other cities and states have a new motivation to move forward with building electrification projects that reduce pollution in their communities. There are already similar legal challenges underway in other places, including Denver, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.

Fortunately, clean energy solutions are becoming more affordable and cost-effective as technology improves and public education increases.

For example, induction stoves are an effective way to avoid the dangers of gas stoves and cook with greater precision in a kitchen without toxic fumes.

Many homeowners have been able to upgrade their old gas stoves to induction ones with federal tax incentives of up to $840 through the Inflation Reduction Act. However, it's crucial to act quickly to take advantage of these cost savings because they're set to expire at the end of the year.

Even if you can't afford a major kitchen upgrade, affordable plug-in induction burners start at just $50.

Fellow Reddit users were encouraged by the news in New York and shared their feedback in support of cleaner, healthier new buildings.

In addition, EPA seeks to revise the reporting deadline under the rule.
Businesses and stakeholders impacted by the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate how the proposed changes might affect their reporting obligations.
It is also important to monitor regulatory developments, as the final rule could significantly alter reporting requirements and associated costs.
EPA's press release on the proposed rule can be found here.","On November 10, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a pre-publication copy of its proposed rule to significantly reduce the scope of its Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) reporting requirements under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Most significantly, the proposed changes seek to exempt imported articles from the reporting requirement. According to EPA, the proposed rule aims to make PFAS reporting under TSCA more practical and easier to implement by reducing unnecessary or duplicative requirements for businesses, while ensuring EPA continues to receive essential information on PFAS use and safety.

In October 2023, EPA finalized a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping regulation requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products between 2011 and 2022 to report certain data to EPA. The rule aimed to improve EPA's understanding of PFAS use and exposure, and potential environmental and health effects. The previous rule did not include traditional TSCA exemptions, raising concerns among regulated entities about significant compliance costs, implementation challenges, and impacts on small businesses—particularly importers of finished products containing PFAS.

Under the proposed rule, EPA now seeks to add key reporting exemptions including: (1) mixtures or articles containing PFAS in concentrations less than 0.1%; (2) PFAS imported as part of an article; (3) certain PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance; (4) PFAS that are impurities; (5) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development purposes; and (6) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates.

In addition, EPA seeks to revise the reporting deadline under the rule. The current reporting deadline is October 13, 2026. EPA is proposing to alter the deadline for reporting, by having the submission period begin 60 days after the rule is finalized and to run for three months. Thus, if the rule is finalized after May 2026, this would result in an extension of the reporting rule's deadline.

Businesses and stakeholders impacted by the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate how the proposed changes might affect their reporting obligations. Companies that prepared for reporting under the 2023 rule might need to revisit compliance strategies and internal recordkeeping. It is also important to monitor regulatory developments, as the final rule could significantly alter reporting requirements and associated costs.

As Africa’s energy demand surges, balancing decarbonisation with energy security has never been more critical. New data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) underscores a pivotal role for both renewable energy and natural gas in driving a sustainable, yet reliable, power future for the continent.

Key findings & context

Electricity demand Is exploding

The IEA projects Africa’s electricity demand will rise by 4.1% in 2025.

To meet this demand sustainably, the IEA report forecasts that over 60 TWh of new generation (2023–2025) will come from renewables, increasing their share of total generation from about 24% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2025

At the same time, natural gas capacity is expected to grow: Africa’s gas-fired electricity is projected to increase by ~30 TWh by 2025, reaching almost 400 TWh.

Shift in investment flows

According to the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report, private-sector clean energy investment in Africa has nearly tripled, rising from ~US$ 17 billion in 2019 to almost US$ 40 billion in 2024.

However, public and DFI (development finance institution) funding has declined sharply — falling by about one‑third over the past decade to reach US$ 20 billion in 2024.

Much of this drop is linked to reduced commitments from some development partners, including Chinese DFIs.

Natural gas as a transition fuel

While fossil fuel investment is declining globally, natural gas remains an important transitional fuel in Africa’s energy mix: several analyses highlight that gas-especially in combined cycle power plants-offers flexible capacity that complements variable renewables.

In parts of Africa, natural gas already accounts for a significant share of the energy mix.

According to the Department of Mineral Resources in South Africa, natural gas makes up 41% of its power generation mix, underscoring its role in just transition strategies.

Just transition imperative

While renewables are growing, energy planners and policymakers must manage the transition in a way that preserves affordability, reliability, and social equity.

A just energy transition in Africa will require strategic use of gas to ensure firm dispatchability, while also scaling up renewables, and ensuring local communities benefit.

What the Africa Energy Indaba will do

At this year’s Africa Energy Indaba, stakeholders will come together to:

Explore best‑practice case studies where African countries have successfully integrated gas and renewables to maintain grid stability while reducing carbon emissions.

Facilitate high-level discussions on how to mobilise public and private capital for green infrastructure, with innovative financing models that account for risk, social impacts, and just transition.

Highlight policy frameworks that support a balanced energy mix: enabling regulators to incentivize renewables growth while using natural gas strategically as a bridging fuel.

Promote technology and capacity-building, including in firm-dispatchable generation (gas, hybrids), storage, and grid flexibility, to ensure reliable power as renewables scale.

Expected impact

Accelerate the pipeline of bankable energy projects that combine clean energy ambition with reliability.

Attract blended finance from DFIs, private investors, and governments to unlock the dual promise of decarbonisation and energy security.

Strengthen African energy institutions’ capacity to manage integrated energy systems, reducing risk and increasing resilience.

Support equitable growth through just-transition frameworks that safeguard communities and create green jobs.

“Our energy future in Africa is not just about reducing emissions – it’s about keeping the lights on, driving industrial growth, and ensuring no one is left behind. Renewables give us decarbonisation; gas gives us security – together, they enable a just transition.” commented Liz Hart, Managing Director of the Africa Energy Indaba. “At the Africa Energy Indaba, we have a unique opportunity to build bridges across sectors – finance, government, developers – and create real, investable energy projects that are both green and reliable.”

This echoes sentiments in SiliconANGLE, which details Google’s $40 billion commitment to Texas infrastructure, emphasizing the scale required for AI expansion.
Fox Business reports Pichai’s announcement as a major AI push, with the $40 billion earmarked for cloud, AI, and energy initiatives.
With AI demands straining grids nationwide, as per a CBS News feature on X, regulators may impose stricter guidelines.
Dallas News reports Google’s investment includes AI and energy infrastructure, potentially reshaping Texas’s tech ecosystem.","In a bold move underscoring the relentless march of artificial intelligence, Alphabet Inc.’s Google has unveiled plans to pour $40 billion into three new data centers in Texas, aiming to supercharge its AI capabilities amid fierce competition from rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic. Announced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, this investment through 2027 marks the company’s largest in any single U.S. state, positioning Texas as a pivotal hub in the global AI infrastructure race. The facilities, including one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County, are set to bolster computing power for AI initiatives, creating thousands of jobs and injecting economic vitality into rural areas.

Yet, this massive influx of capital comes at a time when AI’s voracious energy demands are raising alarms about grid stability. Texas, already a magnet for tech investments due to its abundant renewable energy and business-friendly policies, has seen similar commitments from Microsoft and others, but experts warn that the cumulative strain could overwhelm the state’s power infrastructure. According to Bloomberg, Google’s push is part of a broader effort to expand AI capacity, with the company highlighting Texas’s role in American innovation in a blog post.

The AI Infrastructure Gold Rush

The decision to invest heavily in Texas reflects a strategic pivot toward regions with robust energy resources, particularly wind power, which dominates the state’s renewable sector. Reuters reports that the investment will fund not only data centers but also energy programs and workforce training, potentially making Texas home to more Google facilities than anywhere else globally, as noted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott during the announcement. This aligns with a surge in AI-driven investments, where tech giants are racing to build out infrastructure capable of handling advanced machine learning models.

Industry insiders point to the exponential growth in AI computing needs, with data centers projected to consume vast amounts of electricity. A post on X from Dividend Talks highlights that U.S. data center power use could quadruple by 2030, from 147 TWh to 606 TWh, driven by every AI query and cloud operation. This echoes sentiments in SiliconANGLE, which details Google’s $40 billion commitment to Texas infrastructure, emphasizing the scale required for AI expansion.

Energy Grid Under Pressure

Concerns about energy consumption are not abstract; Texas’s grid, managed by ERCOT, has faced repeated strains from extreme weather and rising demand. Posts on X, including one from Doc Pete Chambers, call for a moratorium on new data centers, citing unassessed vulnerabilities and strains on energy resources. Similarly, a CBS News report shared on X warns of surging U.S. energy demands hitting record highs, fueled by AI and data centers.

The water footprint is equally daunting. Disclose.tv on X notes that AI data centers in Texas, including projects like Microsoft and OpenAI’s Stargate, could consume 399 billion gallons of water by 2030—enough for over 600,000 Olympic-sized pools. This mirrors findings in The Texas Tribune, which describes Google’s investment as the latest in a string of multibillion-dollar bets on AI infrastructure, but with growing scrutiny on resource use.

Global Spending Spree and Economic Ripples

Google’s Texas play is a slice of a larger pie: global tech spending on AI infrastructure is poised to exceed $1 trillion, encompassing data centers, chips, and energy solutions. Fox Business reports Pichai’s announcement as a major AI push, with the $40 billion earmarked for cloud, AI, and energy initiatives. This investment dovetails with projections of explosive growth in connected TV (CTV) and digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising, expected to surge 23.7% as AI enhances targeted marketing, per industry analyses.

Economic benefits are tangible—Google’s plans promise thousands of jobs and community grants, as outlined in the Houston Chronicle. However, critics on X, such as user totinho, decry the ‘energy vampire’ effect, arguing that these centers drain grids while spiking utility bills for residents. The Amarillo Globe-News specifies the Armstrong County campus, underscoring local impacts in the Texas Panhandle.

Balancing Innovation and Sustainability

To mitigate concerns, Google emphasizes sustainable practices, including partnerships for renewable energy. The company’s blog post details commitments to clean energy and workforce development, aiming to offset the environmental toll. Yet, as Joe Allen notes on X, data centers in states like Wyoming are already projected to outpace residential power use, with similar patterns emerging in Texas.

Broader implications extend to national policy. With AI demands straining grids nationwide, as per a CBS News feature on X, regulators may impose stricter guidelines. Finance Yahoo confirms the $40 billion timeline through 2027, positioning Google at the forefront of this transformation.

Competitive Landscape and Future Horizons

Rivals are not idle; OpenAI’s Stargate project in Texas, as mentioned in X posts by Steve Hou, requires over 3 GW of power, illustrating the arms race. Dallas News reports Google’s investment includes AI and energy infrastructure, potentially reshaping Texas’s tech ecosystem.

As AI integrates deeper into daily life—from ad tech growth in CTV and DOOH to computational breakthroughs—the Texas investments signal a new era. However, sustaining this growth demands innovative energy solutions, lest grid strains eclipse the benefits, as echoed in multiple X discussions and reports from Bloomberg and Reuters.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/article-1438-1763363737.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 02:58:47.562373

Strategic Significance: Rare Earth Processing Capabilities & Market Positioning Energy Fuels' development of domestic rare earth processing represents a strategic inflection point with national security implications.
This mineral concentrate contains 50-60 percent total rare earth oxides, substantially higher than alternative materials, with superior concentrations of neodymium-praseodymium and heavy rare earths.
Rare earth oxide markets have experienced significant price appreciation, particularly for heavy rare earths.
The combination of America's leading uranium production platform, breakthrough rare earth processing capabilities, and a global heavy mineral sands pipeline positions Energy Fuels to capture substantial value as critical minerals markets continue structural evolution.","Energy Fuels currently produces more uranium than any other U.S. company, mining approximately 665,000 pounds of U3O8 in Q2 2025 from its Pinyon Plain and La Sal operations, with production costs expected to decline to $23-30 per pound starting Q4 2025.

The company achieved commercial-scale production of high-purity neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide at its White Mesa Mill in 2024 and is piloting heavy rare earth separation, positioning to become America's first commercial producer of dysprosium and terbium oxides by Q4 2026.

The White Mesa Mill in Utah represents the only conventional uranium processing facility in the United States and the only U.S. facility capable of processing monazite into separated rare earth oxides, providing unmatched processing flexibility.

Through its Toliara (Madagascar), Donald (Australia), and Bahia (Brazil) heavy mineral sands projects, Energy Fuels is securing low-cost monazite feedstock with potential combined production exceeding 40,000 tonnes annually, containing approximately 5,381 tonnes of NdPr oxide.

The company maintains over $253 million in working capital with zero debt as of June 30, 2025, providing financial flexibility to advance multiple development projects while uranium prices remain structurally supported above $80 per pound.

Introduction: Critical Minerals at the Intersection of Energy Security and Technology Advancement

The global uranium market reached $80.00 per pound at the end of October 2025, reflecting structural demand growth driven by nuclear energy expansion and supply constraints. This price level, substantially higher than the March 2025 low of $64.23 per pound, underscores the fundamental shift occurring in nuclear fuel markets as governments worldwide accelerate reactor construction and capacity additions. Within this context, Energy Fuels Inc. has emerged as America's preeminent domestic producer of uranium and rare earth elements, operating the strategic White Mesa Mill in Utah.

The investment case for Energy Fuels extends beyond traditional uranium fundamentals to encompass the company's pioneering role in establishing domestic rare earth processing capabilities and developing an innovative, capital-efficient supply chain centered on monazite concentrate byproducts from heavy mineral sands operations. The company's diversified portfolio spans uranium production, rare earth oxide separation, and heavy mineral sands development, positioning it uniquely to capitalize on the convergence of clean energy demand and critical mineral supply security.

DataM Intelligence projects the global uranium market will reach $13.59 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4.86 percent for 2025-2032. Energy Fuels stands positioned to capture substantial market share within this expanding landscape through its integrated production capabilities and strategic asset portfolio.

Company Overview: Building America's Critical Minerals Infrastructure

Energy Fuels operates as the leading U.S. producer of uranium concentrate (U3O8), with current production from conventional mines in Arizona and Utah feeding its wholly-owned White Mesa Mill. The facility, located in southeastern Utah, represents more than four decades of operational expertise and holds licensed capacity to produce over 8 million pounds of U3O8 annually. Beyond uranium, the company has systematically expanded into rare earth element processing, achieving a significant milestone in 2024 with commercial-scale production of separated neodymium-praseodymium oxide at specifications suitable for magnet manufacturing.

This vertical integration leverages the White Mesa Mill's existing solvent extraction infrastructure and regulatory licenses to process monazite, a superior rare earth mineral concentrate naturally containing uranium alongside high concentrations of valuable rare earth oxides. The company's asset portfolio includes currently producing uranium mines at Pinyon Plain in Arizona and the La Sal Complex in Utah, standby operations at Nichols Ranch ISR facility in Wyoming, and three major development-stage uranium projects containing combined resources approaching 70 million pounds of U3O8.

Internationally, Energy Fuels has positioned itself in the heavy mineral sands sector through ownership or joint venture interests in the Toliara Project in Madagascar, Donald Project in Australia, and Bahia Project in Brazil. This diversified asset base provides operational flexibility, multiple growth vectors, and strategic optionality as commodity markets evolve.

Key Development: Uranium Production Scaling & Cost Reduction

Energy Fuels mined approximately 665,000 pounds of U3O8 contained in ore during the second quarter of 2025 from its Pinyon Plain, La Sal, and Pandora mines, stockpiling material for mill processing beginning in Q4 2025. Full-year 2025 mine production guidance ranges between 875,000 and 1,435,000 pounds of U3O8 contained in 55,000 to 80,000 tons of ore, establishing the company as the dominant U.S. producer. The Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona has delivered results significantly exceeding original estimates, with mined ore grades ranging between 33 percent and 100 percent higher than previous resource models in numerous mining areas.

""Energy Fuels mined approximately 635,000 pounds of U3O8 during the 3 months ended June 30, 2025. Mined ore grades ranging between 33% to 100% higher than previous estimates in numerous areas.""

This positive reconciliation indicates substantially more uranium will be recovered from the Main Ore Body than initially projected, while underground drilling has identified additional high-grade zones in the nearby Juniper Ore Body.

These higher grades translate directly into improved project economics. The company expects combined mining, transportation, and processing operating costs to range between $23 and $30 per pound of U3O8 recovered beginning in Q4 2025, when Pinyon Plain ore enters the mill circuit. This cost structure positions Energy Fuels among the lowest-cost uranium producers globally, with significant margin potential at current uranium prices above $80 per pound.

Strategic Significance: Rare Earth Processing Capabilities & Market Positioning

Energy Fuels' development of domestic rare earth processing represents a strategic inflection point with national security implications. The White Mesa Mill currently processes monazite concentrate to produce mixed rare earth carbonate, which undergoes further separation into individual rare earth oxides including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, elements critical to permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, advanced manufacturing, and defense applications. The company achieved commercial-scale production of high-purity NdPr oxide in 2024, with material currently undergoing validation by rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturers.

Piloting efforts have successfully produced 1 kilogram of 99.5 percent pure dysprosium oxide in August 2025, with plans to produce 15 kilograms in October 2025 and 1 kilogram of terbium oxide in November 2025. Commercial production of heavy rare earth oxides could commence as early as Q4 2026 with minor modifications to the existing solvent extraction circuit. This timeline would position Energy Fuels as the first commercial-scale producer of separated heavy rare earth oxides in the United States, addressing critical supply chain vulnerabilities in materials where China currently controls over 90 percent of global processing capacity.

The company's structural advantage stems from its focus on monazite as feedstock. This mineral concentrate contains 50-60 percent total rare earth oxides, substantially higher than alternative materials, with superior concentrations of neodymium-praseodymium and heavy rare earths. Monazite occurs as a low-cost byproduct of heavy mineral sands mining, where the primary revenue derives from titanium and zirconium minerals, making it economically attractive compared to primary rare earth mining operations.

Heavy Mineral Sands Pipeline: Securing Long-Term Feedstock Supply

Energy Fuels has assembled a portfolio of three world-scale heavy mineral sands projects designed to provide decades of low-cost monazite feedstock to the White Mesa Mill. The Toliara Project in Madagascar, acquired through the October 2024 purchase of Base Resources, represents the company's most advanced international development asset. Toliara holds potential to produce 26,000 tonnes of monazite annually from a 39-year mine life, containing approximately 2,600 tonnes per year of NdPr oxide plus significant quantities of dysprosium and terbium.

The Donald Project in Australia, operated as a joint venture with Astron Corporation where Energy Fuels can earn up to 49 percent ownership while securing 100 percent of monazite offtake, is fully permitted and considered shovel-ready. Phase 1 development contemplates 7,000 tonnes of monazite production annually, expandable to 14,000 tonnes in Phase 2, with final investment decision possible in the second half of 2025. The Donald deposit contains exceptional concentrations of heavy rare earths, providing world-leading feedstock quality.

In Brazil, the Bahia Project represents an earlier-stage opportunity with several exploration and mining permits in place covering well-defined heavy mineral sands mineralization. Combined with existing offtake from Chemours Company providing 500-1,000 tonnes of monazite annually, these projects position Energy Fuels to control 40,900 tonnes of monazite feedstock, establishing a globally significant rare earth supply chain centered in the United States.

Financial Position & Market Context

Energy Fuels maintained working capital of $253.23 million as of June 30, 2025, with zero debt. This liquidity position comprises $71.49 million of cash and cash equivalents, $126.41 million of marketable securities, $7.79 million of trade receivables, and $76.50 million of inventory. Finished product inventory includes 725,000 pounds of U3O8, 905,000 pounds of V2O5, 9,000 kilograms of high-purity mixed rare earth carbonate, and 37,000 kilograms of separated NdPr oxide.

The company reported a net loss of $21.81 million in the second quarter of 2025, reflecting its strategic decision to limit uranium sales during temporarily weaker prices, combined with ongoing development expenditures. Energy Fuels' strong balance sheet provides flexibility to advance multiple development projects simultaneously without immediate capital markets dependence. The company holds four long-term uranium sales contracts with U.S. nuclear utilities featuring fixed and market-linked price components, with contract deliveries totaling 300,000 pounds in 2025, increasing to 620,000-880,000 pounds in 2026.

Rare earth oxide markets have experienced significant price appreciation, particularly for heavy rare earths. NdPr oxide prices increased 19.5 percent in the past month from $61.89 to $73.93 per kilogram, while dysprosium oxide prices in Europe have surged 348 percent and terbium oxide has appreciated 367 percent, reflecting acute supply constraints outside Chinese-controlled supply chains.

On its face, this suggests the clean-mobility dream is coming true. But a deeper look reveals emerging cracks. The boom may be less about broad-based demand and more about premium segments and state incentives. If the policy architecture fails to keep pace, the risk is a slowdown that wastes India’s manufacturing thrust and undermines energy-security goals.

According to recent data, India’s electric four-wheeler registrations in Apr-Oct 2025 doubled year-on-year and reached 4.6 % of passenger vehicle share. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in October-2025 hit a new monthly peak of 2.34 lakh units—with two-wheelers still dominant. These numbers show growth. Yet they also hide structural stress.

READ | Blockchain regulation: Why India must see beyond crypto

Much of the surge is concentrated in urban pockets, premium segments and states with strong incentives. At the same time, the price-gap between EVs and internal-combustion engine (ICE) vehicles has narrowed because of GST cuts and import code changes. That reduces the differential advantage and thus the consumer trigger for many buyers. Supply-chain constraints—especially around battery inputs and magnets—remain unresolved.

EV adoption: Why the risk of plateau looms

The transition logic for EVs rests on four pillars: affordability, charging infrastructure, supply-chain stability, and compelling total cost-of-ownership (TCO). If any pillar falters, momentum stalls.

First, affordability remains an issue. Even with subsidies, many EVs cost significantly more upfront than ICE alternatives. Second, charging infrastructure is patchy in many states. Rural and semi-urban areas remain poorly served. Third, supply-chain risks are real: raw-material shortages and import dependencies raise cost risks and hinder mass-market rollout. Fourth, demand is as important as supply. A model driven by premium buyers may reach its ceiling sooner than a model built on mass adoption.

In short, while the one million plus number is promising, it is not yet an inflection point for a full-scale mobility shift. Without deeper structural fixes, India may see growth flatten out rather than accelerate.

Why this matters for India

India has set ambitious targets: 30 % EV sales by 2030, 500 GW non-fossil energy and a large domestic manufacturing ecosystem. If the EV transition stalls, these ambitions are at risk. Manufacturing plants under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme may operate below capacity. Job creation will be lower. Imports of petrol and diesel will remain elevated, undermining energy-security and emissions goals.

For households the implications are mixed. Early adopters in urban metros may enjoy lower lifecycle cost. But if subsidies fade, charging remains unreliable and residual values are weak, mid-income buyers may feel apprehensive. For states the risk is stranded infrastructure and subsidies that no longer catalyse demand.

Where the policy gaps are widening

India’s policy architecture has many strengths—FAME-II, state EV policies, PLI for batteries, and tax incentives. Yet gaps persist.

Many state incentives are now being rolled back or capped just when markets are maturing. Some states are seeing adoption stagnate. For example, one report found that a major southern state mustered just 1.8 % EV share in five years. This level of heterogeneity undermines the notion of a uniformly advancing mobility transition.

Infrastructure remains uneven. While metros may boast fast-chargers and network maps, most towns lack reliable public charging. Without this backbone, range-anxiety remains real.

Supply chains are globally contested. India still imports large fractions of cell chemistry, magnets and assembly lines. Without decisive localisation, the manufacturing push remains vulnerable to external shocks and cost escalation. Add to this the fall in GST on ICE vehicles and the narrowing of the differential price advantage for EVs. That undermines the value proposition.

What needs to happen for the transition to regain pace

If India is to turn momentum into mass movement, policy must shift beyond incentives and volume headlines.

First, the focus must move from incentive-driven demand to fundamental affordability and TCO improvement. Lower barrier pricing, credible residual-value frameworks, battery-swapping models, and financing innovations must all come together. Second, charging infrastructure must become as standard as fuel stations. Rural and semi-urban deployment, interoperability across states, and integration with grid-management are critical.

Third, supply-chain resilience must be built—cells, battery manufacturing, magnet recovery, recycling. India cannot afford to import its way to green mobility at scale. Fourth, states must adopt stable, long-term policies rather than short-cycle incentives. A one-year subsidy expansion followed by rollback disrupts investor and buyer confidence.

Equally important is consumer education and transparency. Many buyers remain uncertain about warranty, resale value, charging habits and servicing availability. Without addressing such anxiety, growth may slow.

Momentum is no guarantee of breakthrough

India’s EV numbers are clearly heading in the right direction. The growth in vehicle registration, the manufacturing announcements, the policy framework—all look promising. But what is not yet apparent is the full ecosystem shift: affordability for the many, reliable charging for the accessible, supply chains for the scalable, policy stability for the sustainable.

If India continues on the current trajectory without recalibrating these pillars, the risk is a growth plateau. Instead of a rapid leap to electric mobility, the economy may slip into a prolonged and uneven transition. For a nation with high stakes in climate goals, manufacturing ambition and energy-security, that outcome would be a missed opportunity.

India can still convert momentum into mastery. But only if the next stage of policy is crafted not for those who bought the first wave of EVs, but for those who will buy in the next decade.",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EVSS-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 03:57:41.863075

As academic buildings undergo constant renovations, student spaces should also be improved to bridge physical space design and mental well-being.

The psychology of physical space, which investigates how people’s surroundings influence their emotions and behavior, has determined that areas meant to increase students’ motivation can take many forms. Therefore, it’s critical to have environments catered to diverse psychological needs.

“When I go (to) study, the things I look for (are) generally areas that are quieter, … places with a more open environment and natural lighting,” biochemistry freshman Hannah Truong said.

When studying, students typically seek an area that motivates them to achieve a specific result. Situational characteristics, such as warmth and moderate brightness within a space can enhance people’s memory, while the absence of natural light in an academic setting has short-term negative effects on intellectual performance.

“The one I go to a lot is (Perry-Castañeda Library) … I started going less because although it has pretty good natural lighting, sometimes it’s a bit dreary,” Truong said.

Although some preferred characteristics of a study space vary among individuals, factors like control and variety determine the benefits of flexible learning spaces for students. A student’s control in a space, such as their ability to shift table layouts or alter a room’s temperature, plays a significant role in their comfortability. It isn’t feasible to cater to all individual preferences in architectural design, but having a variety of academic areas that support privacy and collaboration allows students to explore what spaces are most beneficial for their goals.

Although students’ autonomy within student-centered spaces may initially seem obvious, how can we be expected to advocate for our needs in spaces that fail to uplift us mentally?

“I was very surprised to find out how little (students) felt like they could do within a space,” said Tamie Glass, associate professor of the department of design in the College of Fine Arts. “There’s a discrepancy between sometimes (how) faculty, or maybe leadership, … perceives a space versus how students do.”

If more academic environments considered student spatial experiences as they differ from faculty, students could feel greater comfortability to advocate for their needs among campus leadership. Beyond mere aesthetics and utility, UT’s architecture plays a vital role in supporting students’ mental health.

Dr. Samuel Gosling, professor of psychology in the College of Liberal Arts, specializes in the psychology of physical space and how personality is shown in everyday environments. Gosling recognizes that if architecture were seen as a helping profession, one prioritizing well-being as opposed to artistry, buildings would be largely more effective at helping people.

“It seems to me that all architecture students should be required to take not just basic psychology, but probably quite a lot of psychology,” Gosling said. “Shouldn’t you know something about the individuals you’re building these spaces for?”

Similar to how doctors and social workers learn human psychology to adequately provide diverse support, architects should use physical space psychology to maximize the emotional and psychological fulfillment of their designs. With more recognition of this field and attention to student experiences, campus architects can boost student well-being into a larger landscape of importance.

FIGURE 2 FIGURE 3 A Tipping Point: For Millions, Energy Debt Is Severe For millions of families, rising energy bills and past-due balances represent a crisis.
Higher Energy Bills Are Pushing Families Deeper Into Debt Families simply can’t keep up with rising energy costs.","As temperatures cool and Americans’ dissatisfaction with the economy grows, families across the country are staring down a winter season that will be more expensive than ever, punctuated by rising energy bills on top of the already high cost of living. This year, industry experts estimate it will cost families an average of $976 to heat their homes during the winter season—a 7.6 percent price increase that follows record-breaking cooling costs during the summer.

Rising utility costs are already taking a toll on family finances. The Century Foundation and Protect Borrowers’ analysis of consumer credit data shows an avalanche of household utility debt has been building over the past three years and will likely worsen in the months ahead. Specifically, our analysis shows that:

Families can’t keep up: rising energy bills are driving more households deeper into debt. Since 2022, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789—a 32 percent increase.

Black and Asian consumers carry the highest average overdue utility balances, approaching $900, compared to $750 for white consumers.

Deep subprime households who are already financially vulnerable are being hit the hardest, with past-due utility balances jumping from $643 to $834—debts that can mushroom through interest and penalties

Millions are facing severe utility debt heading into the winter months. Nearly one in twenty households—equivalent to roughly 14 million Americans—have utility debt so severe that it was sent or soon will be sent to collections. The rates are nearly twice as high in parts of the South and Appalachia. These consumers live in states with harsher collection practices that drive one in twelve households to face added strain on family budgets and credit.

In the first six months of President Trump’s second term, we estimate that the number of households with severely overdue utility debt increased by roughly 117,000—a 3.8 percent rise.

Across the Atlantic coast and in parts of the Midwest, overdue utility balances total more than $1,500 on average.

Utility prices are on the rise across the country. Comparing twelve-month moving averages from March 2022 to June 2025 (to adjust for seasonality), monthly energy costs (in the part of the sample that reports on-time payments of bills relating to home electricity, gas, and other fuels) nationwide rose from $196 to $265—a 35 percent jump, or nearly three times overall inflation during that period.

No corner of the country is immune from energy price hikes: while states in the Northeast face the highest average utility bills of $300 or more, states such as Arizona ($289), California ($303), and Texas ($269) are also hit with punishingly high prices, likely due to heavy cooling demands.

Energy and utility bills are not luxury goods; they are core expenses in a family’s budget. Keeping the lights on is fundamental to one’s ability to live a healthy, stable life. The sharp spike in monthly utility bills and overdue balances serves as a warning sign that a growing number of households cannot keep up with basic necessities and are falling into debt as a result. For older Americans, particularly those with fixed incomes, rising utility bills pose outsized risks—jeopardizing seniors’ access to safe, stable housing and increasing economic insecurity more broadly.

Unfortunately, this energy cost crisis is likely to get worse. Electricity markets today are broken, with poorly regulated monopolies overcharging customers to the tune of $5 billion a year. Federal regulations allow utilities to earn profits based on what they build, rather than on the reliability of performance—leading to underinvestment in any efficiency improvements in electricity transmission that could lower costs. Moreover, the explosion of AI data centers, and the growing demand for energy they require, is driving up the cost of energy, sending household utility bills through the roof. And the Trump administration has added fuel to the fire, taking actions that directly contribute to rising utility costs by impeding renewable energy generation while simultaneously dismantling the support systems in place to protect low-income Americans from utility debt.

The energy cost crisis is not sustainable. Working families are already on the brink—with millions forced to skip meals, dip into their savings, and turn to credit cards and other risky financial products and practices just to get by. For many Americans, higher heating costs this winter could be the tipping point.

Monthly Energy Bills Are Rising Across the Country

Our analysis shows that from March 2022 to June 2025, average monthly energy bills rose from $196 to $265—a 35 percent jump, or nearly three times overall inflation during that period (see Figure 1). What’s worrisome is that the trend is getting worse since the start of the year: nearly one-fourth of that three-year increase came in the past two quarters alone. According to our data and the consumer price index, home energy prices are surging past other costs, with the average family getting an annual price hike of over $800 for these bills.

FIGURE 1

No corner of the country is safe from rising energy costs. While states in the Northeast face some of the highest average monthly bills of $300 or more, heavy demand for cooling elsewhere means that families in states such as Arizona ($289), California ($303), Texas ($269), and across the Southeast are also getting hit with punishingly high energy costs (see Figures 2 and 3). Because our analysis (through June 2025) precedes peak summer temperatures, it is safe to assume that millions of families today are facing even higher costs than what is shown here.

FIGURE 2

FIGURE 3

A Tipping Point: For Millions, Energy Debt Is Severe

For millions of families, rising energy bills and past-due balances represent a crisis. As of June 2025, we find that nearly one in twenty households—or roughly 14 million Americans—have debt so severe it was sent to collections or in arrears. This figure climbs to roughly one in twelve in parts of the South and Appalachia, nearly twice the rates as the national average (see Figure 4).

FIGURE 4

Across the Atlantic coast and in parts of the Midwest, overdue utility balances total more than $1,500, driven in part by colder climates, older housing, and pricier heating fuels (see Figure 5). Many of these states also limit winter shutoffs, which allow unpaid balances to carry through the cold months. Yet, lower past-due balances in other states do not necessarily mean less hardship, as they can reflect faster escalation to disconnection and collection. In these regions, families struggling to pay utility bills are likely being sent to collections much earlier, putting them on a faster path to financial ruin.

FIGURE 5

Many families today are on the brink of having their power shut off. In the first six months of President Trump’s second term, we estimate that the number of households with severely overdue utility debt increased by roughly 117,000—a 3.8 percent rise.

As alarming as these findings are, they represent a fraction of the true crisis, since many utility companies report overdue accounts only after households become severely delinquent—often 120 days or more past due—and have been sold to a collection agency. Therefore, this data captures only the most extreme cases of financial distress, long after a family has fallen deep into debt.

Higher Energy Bills Are Pushing Families Deeper Into Debt

Families simply can’t keep up with rising energy costs. Since 2022, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789—a 32 percent increase, or 2.7 times overall inflation (see Figure 6).

FIGURE 6

The burden of this utility debt is not felt equally, falling hardest on households that were already financially vulnerable. As of June 2025, 10.8 percent of Black households carry an overdue utility balance, which is roughly three times the rate for white households (3.6 percent). Among those with past-due bills, Black and Asian consumers carry the highest overdue utility balances, approaching $900, compared to $750 for white consumers (see Figure 7). Energy insecurity follows the same racial fault lines as broader economic inequality, leaving communities of color more exposed to high balances and with less access to assistance.

FIGURE 7

For deep subprime households—those with credit scores below 580—the average past-due balance climbed from $643 in 2022 to $834 by June 2025, a 30 percent jump (see Figure 8). While the data set does not have individual income, it does show that deep subprime households disproportionately reside in low-income and urban neighborhoods and are thus more likely to have low income. These consumers are being especially pressed by the high cost of housing, food, child care, and transportation—and too often there’s not enough left over to pay the utility bill. Not only does this leave them vulnerable to power cuts, but also it can be one more factor that further increases their cost of living and makes them vulnerable to having to take on new, costly debt just to make ends meet.

FIGURE 8

One might expect super-prime borrowers from more affluent households to spend more on home energy, and that trend was evident at the start of the period analyzed. But in recent quarters, utility bills have converged among credit scores, with deep subprime households actually paying more than individuals with better credit scores (see Figure 9). That’s because the fixed costs of delivering electricity to households are one of the fastest rising parts of energy bills, as companies pass along spending on transmission to households.

FIGURE 9

Conclusion

Our findings paint a grim picture: a toxic combination of increasing energy prices, rising overdue balances, and squeezed household budgets that together are pushing families deeper and deeper into debt. Furthermore, soaring utility bills are the tip of the iceberg for millions of Americans already overburdened by rising costs for health care, groceries, rent, child care, education, and more.

Americans want leaders to confront these high prices head-on and take steps to limit how utility companies use their monopoly power to rip off consumers. The utility industry has been rife with mega-mergers (that have consolidated eighty-three companies into only thirteen) that have led to windfall profits for investors by stifling competition with little benefit to consumers. It leads to a consistent pattern of higher bills and poorer service.

Yet, instead of addressing these root causes of energy inflation, the Trump administration has made the problem worse—stymying the development of abundant renewable energy and threatening the assistance that families need to get through the winter. When millions of Americans cannot afford to keep the lights on, it is a fundamental failure of economic policy that demands a renewed commitment to bring down the price of energy and confront the crisis of utility debt.

Appendix: Data and Methodology

TCF and Protect Borrowers’ analysis uses individual-level longitudinal records from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel (UC-CCP), a 2 percent, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with credit files. Within this panel, utility obligations appear on credit reports in two forms: (1) seriously past-due debts and (2) active (noncollection) utility accounts.

Identification of Past-Due Utility Debt

We define past-due utility debt as tradelines showing severe delinquency, captured in two groups: (1) accounts that have been sent to a third-party for collections, which constitute the vast majority (over 95 percent) of these observations; (2) accounts that are ninety or more days delinquent but have not yet been transferred to a collection agency. We isolate these records using original-creditor classification codes for “utilities.” This bucket includes electric, gas, water, and sewer providers. We can explicitly exclude only cable (Internet) and cellular utility accounts. Because energy bills are typically larger than nonenergy utilities, this approach provides a strong proxy for past-due energy debt; any residual inclusion of nonenergy utilities (with generally lower balances) likely makes our average-balance estimates lower than what they would be if we could disaggregate further.

Identification of Active Utility Tradelines and Monthly Payments

We also analyze active, noncollection utility tradelines furnished directly to the credit bureaus. Empirically, these look like open, pay-in-full accounts:

Account current, no credit limit, and zero amount past due.

AI-driven data centers are accelerating electricity demand and stressing NJ’s power grid

Rising energy costs and grid congestion threaten industrial projects, especially cold storage facilities

Developers must treat electricity as core infrastructure, writer says

Small Modular Reactors and AI-enabled efficiency systems offer promising near-term solutions

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last month secured a Department of Energy study examining how AI-driven data centers are driving up electricity costs and straining grid reliability. The fact that Congress is pressing for such a review for consumers underscores what industrial developers have long understood: the cost and availability of power is rapidly becoming one of the defining constraints of this decade.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects record electricity consumption of 4,179 billion kWh in 2025, with demand rising by 20% by 2030 and a whopping 78% by 2050, according to technology consulting firm ICF International. This surge will be driven by electrified transportation, industrial automation investments, and expanding data center workloads.

In the PJM grid serving New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and 11 other states, forecasts indicate 30 gigawatts of new demand will be added by 2030, with nearly all of it coming from data centers.

With rising demand comes rising costs. PJM capacity auction prices have jumped nearly tenfold in two years, and analysts expect household electricity bills in the Mid-Atlantic to climb more than 60% by 2030. For industrial tenants already squeezed by taxes and insurance, volatile energy costs are a growing concern.

Nowhere is this more evident than in cold storage, where power consumption is significantly higher than in dry warehouses. Refrigeration systems operate 24/7, supported by advanced energy management and humidity control systems. The result is extraordinary demand: 25-to-30 kilowatt-hours per square foot annually. Not surprisingly, these facilities rely on redundant backup systems, including generators and UPS [uninterruptible power supply] units, because a brief outage risks millions of dollars in spoiled goods.

At New Jersey’s current rate of approximately 18.38¢ per kilowatt-hour for commercial users, cold-storage facilities can face up to $15.60 per square foot in electricity costs annually.

The hard truth

While New Jersey’s grid remains reliable, it was not designed for the surge of AI-driven logistics, electrified truck fleets, and expanded manufacturing. The PJM interconnection queue is already congested, with projects waiting extended periods for approvals to tie into the grid.

For industrial developers, this can mean delays, cost overruns, and in some cases, project cancellations. Some operators are experimenting with thermal energy storage and other innovations to blunt peak loads and qualify for clean energy incentives. Others face the hard truth: securing enough power capacity at a site can be as daunting as raising capital or obtaining entitlements.

This is why developers must now treat electricity as core infrastructure. That starts with engaging utilities early in the entitlement process to align project timelines with grid upgrades. It also means embedding resilience into design, including onsite generation, battery storage, and microgrids that shield tenants from volatility. Even lease structures are evolving, with some indexed to demand charges or incorporating efficiency standards to balance costs and incentivize conservation.

[D]evelopers must now treat electricity as core infrastructure.

Innovation offers further promise. AI-enabled cooling systems and demand-aware scheduling are already demonstrating measurable reductions in peak loads and operating costs. The most forward-looking projects are addressing energy constraints head-on, gaining a competitive edge by delivering reliable, cost-stable power alongside traditional locational advantages.

Near-term solutions

Unfortunately, creating new sources of generation takes a decade or more, and businesses in New Jersey are increasingly concerned these challenges will not be resolved before we enter a critical period of unmet demand. However, several near-term solutions are gaining momentum.

For one, Small Modular Reactors, or compact nuclear fission reactors that can be assembled on smaller site footprints. These are drawing interest from New Jersey businesses as a timely solution until longer-term power sources such as nuclear become viable.

Already, numerous SMRs are expected to be approved in the 2030s, guaranteeing reliable, carbon-free, and siting-flexible alternatives for large campuses and microgrids.

But New Jersey cannot afford to watch from the sidelines, especially when new generation takes a decade to come online. The choices our leaders make today will determine whether power is a long-term constraint in the state and across the country, or a catalyst for industrial growth and innovation.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/11/Electric-Grid.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 01:57:28.608807

Over this same timeframe, annual EV sales increased by a factor of 12.
In 2015, both automakers offered only three EV models; by 2025, GM and Hyundai offered 14 and 15 EV models, respectively.
The automakers’ EV sales have grown significantly alongside the number of available models.
These shifts demonstrate manufacturers’ strategies to continue their EV sales momentum absent federal incentives, but also highlight the challenge of sustaining growth as federal incentives wane.","This is the exact wrong moment for automakers to lose their nerve in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). A decade of consistent growth has culminated in record-breaking EV sales. More than 1.2 million new light-duty EVs were sold through the first three quarters of 2025, higher than any prior year; the EV sales share reached nearly 12% in the third quarter. More broadly, over 7 million EVs were sold from 2015 to September 2025, with more than half occurring in the past 3 years.

American drivers want EVs, and the data prove it. Yet several U.S. manufacturers have backtracked on their commitment to the EV transition. If these automakers retreat now, European, Chinese, and South Korean manufacturers will eagerly fill the gap. The decisions made by automakers and policymakers today will determine who leads the next era of clean vehicles—and who gets left behind.

A key driver of this growth is expanded EV model availability, and in particular more affordable options. In 2015, only VW offered at least five different EV models across its brands; by 2025, 10 automakers offered five or more EV models, with seven automakers offering 10 or more. Over this same timeframe, annual EV sales increased by a factor of 12. In 2015, there were 19 car, zero pickup, and six crossover/SUV EV models on the U.S. market. In 2025, there are 28 car, 6 pickup, and 79 SUV EV models available. Many of these models start below $50,000—and buyers have responded. Through September 2025, 68% of BEV sales were of models starting under that threshold. Diversification has opened new market segments and attracted a wider range of consumers, resulting in record sales and market shares.

Sales data from GM and Hyundai bear out this trend. In 2015, both automakers offered only three EV models; by 2025, GM and Hyundai offered 14 and 15 EV models, respectively. The automakers’ EV sales have grown significantly alongside the number of available models. GM’s EV sales have grown more than 7 times since 2015, and Hyundai’s more than 100 times.

The removal of tax incentives will hurt but not halt the EV transition

The expiration and reduction of federal tax credits for EVs have effectively increased the upfront cost of electric vehicles in the United States. But the economics still favor EVs: drivers save thousands in fuel and maintenance over the lifetime of a battery electric vehicle—savings that more than offset the higher purchase price and result in lower total cost of ownership even without incentives. As battery prices continue to fall due to global competition and economies of scale, EVs are on pace to soon reach cost parity with conventional vehicles, making the economic advantage even more compelling.

In response to changes in federal incentives, some automakers have taken proactive steps to maintain momentum. Tesla slashed prices on its Model 3 and Model Y. GM brought back the Bolt and introduced lower-priced Equinox EV versions. Ford adjusted pricing and released new, more affordable trims of the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. These shifts demonstrate manufacturers’ strategies to continue their EV sales momentum absent federal incentives, but also highlight the challenge of sustaining growth as federal incentives wane. Automakers that bring affordable EVs to market and adapt to the policy changes are likely to have higher EV sales, and to be in a leadership position in the longer term.

Recognizing the limitations of federal support, states have stepped in with innovative policies and incentive programs. Colorado recently increased rebates for qualifying new EVs to $9,000. California’s ZEV Forward report recently offered recommendations for spurring zero-emission vehicle sales, which included streamlined permitting, expanded rebates, and EV requirements to accelerate adoption. Cap-and-invest programs in California channel proceeds into EV infrastructure and rebates for low- and moderate-income households. Meanwhile, the U.S. Climate Alliance launched the Affordable Clean Cars coalition, helping states share best practices and coordinate incentives. States are expected to continue to fill gaps in federal support to sustain momentum.

Early data from fall 2025 illustrate the underlying strength of EV demand despite near-term disruptions. Preliminary October sales figures show BEV sales dropped about 25% compared to October 2024, as the federal consumer purchase incentive expired. However, September BEV sales surged more than 40% year-over-year, suggesting strong consumer interest drove many buyers to act before the incentive ended. While the market may experience a brief adjustment period, the fundamentals remain solid: expanded model availability, improving economics, and proactive industry and state responses position the EV market for continued growth. As new models launch and consumers adapt to the post-incentive landscape, we expect EV sales momentum to recover.

Whoever navigates the EV transition wins the race

The U.S. electric vehicle market stands at a crossroads. Record sales, expanding model lineups, and strong consumer demand point to a bright future—if industry and policymakers resist nearsighted backtracking. As nations vie for EV leadership, American manufacturers that maintain or intensify their EV strategies stand to win big, at home and abroad. Conversely, those that retreat risk ceding ground to European, Chinese, and South Korean automakers, which are doubling down on electrification.

Going forward, full commitment to electrification will be a prerequisite for relevance in the global automotive market. Automakers that stay the course, investing in new models and manufacturing capacity, are poised to reap the rewards of global competitiveness and domestic market leadership. Policymakers can support American automakers with innovative policy, ensuring incentives and infrastructure keep pace with evolving technology and consumer needs. The winners will be those that seize the opportunity, act boldly despite near-term challenges, and lead the charge into the electrified future.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-2166290007.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:58:46.251740

If electric vehicles do take over, how will that change our electrical grid?","Donald Trump is not a fan of electric vehicles. In a 2023 Christmas message, he claimed “All Electric Vehicle Lunacy” thugs, among others, were “looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL.” And even though he did end up buying an EV from his political mega-donor Elon Musk, Trump has tried to quash the American electric vehicle market, from halting funding for chargers to waiving fines for fuel efficiency violations.

But here’s the question: Are we getting to the point where EVs make sense even without the government? Electric vehicles are no longer the niche novelty they once were, and sales worldwide have been exploding since Trump last left office. In some countries new EVs are as common as gas cars—if not more. In China, EVs make up roughly 50% of new car sales. In Norway it’s nearly 90%.

So are we at a tipping point on EVs? Is the world just going to pick up momentum and leave the US in the dust? Or is there still a window in which Trump can slam on the brakes?

Throwing up Roadblocks

1. No more carrots. If you want EVs to take over, you need people to buy them. And one of the things that had been sweetening the deal for US car buyers was a hefty tax credit from the federal government—up to $7,500 on new electric vehicles. But that credit, which was supposed to go through 2032, got axed as part of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” And when it officially expired at the end of September, as experts were predicting, sales of electric vehicles subsequently plummeted. Estimates put their market share going from 12% to only 5% that month.

2. And no more sticks. Another way governments have tried to get more EVs on the road is targeting manufacturers. California, for example, had strict rules around air pollution, which required auto manufacturers to sell an increasing number of exhaust-free electric vehicles, up to 100% by 2035. But the Trump administration has now decreed that states can’t set their own rules on car emissions anymore. California sued, of course, but in the meantime Trump is trying to revoke the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas car emissions entirely. This all may make car makers look twice at whether they need to switch to EVs, or whether they can keep pumping out gas guzzlers.

3. The “Meh”-ing of America. There are signs that electric cars were already hitting some speed bumps. Polling last year suggested that, even before Trump took office, Americans were cooling on electric cars. Pew Research Center found that in 2024 only 29% of Americans said they would seriously consider an electric car for their next vehicle, down 9% compared to the previous year. One reason might be concern about the availability of charging stations. Another may be a sudden drop in confidence that EVs are actually better for the environment than gas cars: 20 percentage points since 2020! That’s a huge drop. Pew doesn’t get into why this drop happened, but it may have to do with worries about the harms of battery manufacturing. Yet the data doesn’t bear this out: EVs still handily beat gas engines in terms of climate impact over the course of their lifetime.

Not Slowing Down

1. The price is (nearly) right. So the loss of that $7,500 tax credit definitely hurts. But new electric vehicles have been getting cheaper over time, even without it. In fact, we’re now at the point where they may already be cheaper than gas cars when you add in the cost of fuel and wear-and-tear over the car’s lifetime. And we may be right at the start of what Forbes called a “perfect storm” of cheap raw materials, price wars, and a flood of affordable EV’s now coming out of China. If electric cars really reach a 1:1 buying price with gas cars (which may already be happening for some categories and countries, like SUVs in China), government tax incentives may not be needed for them to take over.

2. Out for delivery. Also, while personal EVs get most of the attention, they’re not the only kind of electric vehicle on the road. Many big companies like Amazon have switched at least part of their vehicle fleet over to electric, purchasing over $1 billion worth of Rivian vehicles in 2024 alone. And if battery prices continue to drop, it may make sense for even some heavy-duty tractor trailer operators to switch over. If these companies push for EVs, they have so much cash and weight behind them that the infrastructure and rest of the market may follow, even if individual consumers are still unsure.

3. The US is not the only market—and it’s not the biggest. While it looks as though U.S. auto makers are now walking back from visions of an all-electric future, they’re not closing up shop. In August, Ford announced they were investing a further $5 billion into electric vehicle production. Part of the logic might be that, while the U.S. is a major market, it’s not the only one. And even if the US cools down, the world at large is still pushing ahead. Globally, around 1-in-5 new cars sold is now electric. In China, that number is nearly 1-in-2. If U.S. automakers want to tap into those markets, they’ll need to be prepared to meet the demand.

What to Keep An Eye On

1. Battery tech. Batteries are the heart of electric vehicles, so any changes or breakthroughs in battery technology (like China’s all-solid-state battery, battery-swapping stations, or something more experimental) has the potential to really shake-up the EV market.

2. Chip shortages. While batteries are important, another component worth keeping an eye on are computer chips. Modern cars (both electric and gas to be fair) rely on a bevy of internal computers to function. In some ways, they have as much in common with a computer network as a steam engine. Shortages or supply chain issues around semiconductor chips could slow down production.

3. Changes to the electrical grid. If electric vehicles do take over, how will that change our electrical grid? We’ll need more chargers, for sure, but some experts are investigating even more interesting changes, as Anthropocene covered in September. One idea is whether we could use electric vehicles as on-grid energy storage (imagine an agreement to let the power company tap your car battery during high demand hours in exchange for lower rates later, for instance, or being able to power your house or even an entire neighborhood off car batteries during a blackout).",https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EV-momentum-final.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:58:49.672453

Looking ahead, the company will continue expanding its portfolio of natural gas-fired and renewable power plants both domestically and internationally, reinforcing long-term growth and enhancing energy security throughout the energy transition.

Mr. Tawatchai Sumranwanich, President of EGCO Group, said, “The operating performance in the third quarter and the nine months of this year clearly underscores EGCO Group’s efficiency in managing our assets and investment portfolio, as well as our ability to strengthen our financial position amid numerous challenges in both domestic and international power and energy markets. During this period, EGCO Group has continued to make significant strategic moves, including the completion of a 49% acquisition of the 125 MW Wheatsborough Solar power plant in Ohio, the United States which is the second of two clean energy projects in the Pinnacle II Portfolio acquired by EGCO Group. In addition, EGCO Group has increased its stake in Linden Cogeneration, a 980 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, to 38%. This reinforces EGCO Group’s strategic presence in the U.S. power market.”

In Q3/2025, EGCO Group recognized a total revenue of THB 6,928 million, an operating profit of THB 844 million, and a net loss of THB 656 million. Key contributors of the operating profit were the strong performance of the two hydropower plants in Lao PDR – Nam Theun 2 and Xayaburi -supported by high water levels during the rainy season. Additional positive contributions came from international power plants, including Linden Cogen and Compass Portfolio in the United States, Paju ES in South Korea, San Buenaventura in the Philippines, as well as the infrastructure solutions company “CDI Group” in Indonesia. However, several factors significantly affected Q3/2025 results. These include the scheduled outage maintenance of the Quezon power plant in the Philippines in preparation for its commercial operation date (COD) on 26 October 2025, under the new Power Supply Agreement (PSA). The third quarter’s performance was also impacted by the effects of fair value measurement of financial instruments and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which are accounting-related items that are specific to the period and do not affect the long-term return generating potential.

For the nine-month period of 2025, EGCO Group posted a total revenue of THB 29,126 million, an operating profit of THB 4,348 million, and a net profit of THB 5,078 million. Key contributors to this 9M/2025 performance included the hydropower plants in Lao PDR, the San Buenaventura power plant in the Philippines, the Paju ES power plant in South Korea, and the U.S. power plants. The company also recognized gain from the divestment of its investments in the RISEC power plant in the United States and the Boco Rock Wind Farm in Australia. These divestments align with EGCO Group’s asset recycling strategy, under which assets are sold at an appropriate time and the proceeds reinvested in new projects to enhance value creation and support long-term growth.

Mr. Tawatchai added, “The outlook of the total operating performance in 2025 will be supported by revenue contributions from international projects in which the company has invested, including the Pinnacle II Portfolio with a combined capacity of 251 MW and the increased ownership interest in the Linden Cogen to 38%. The company also anticipates that its U.S. power assets will benefit from rising electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centers and AI-related industries, alongside generally positive electricity market conditions in the United States.”

In terms of new investments, EGCO Group continues to pursue strategic initiatives, including seeking investment opportunities within its core power business. The company is focusing on high-quality natural gas-fired and renewable energy projects that support its Net Zero emissions target. This includes investments through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as greenfield developments in markets where the company already operates and has strong local partners – particularly in the United States, a major strategic hub where EGCO Group has steadily expanded its presence over the past five years.

For domestic investments, the company is awaiting the results of the second round of the RE Big Lot, in which EGCO Group has been shortlisted for 11 projects with a combined installed capacity of 448 MW. The company is also exploring the feasibility of the direct PPA policy, which allows private-sector entities to purchase electricity directly from clean energy producers. This policy is expected to attract substantial investment from data center and AI businesses that require reliable and clean power.",https://www.kaohooninternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EGCO_2025-11-17_news.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 22:58:37.282825

He was 71.

During a career that spanned more than four decades, Bernhard was perhaps best known for founding and growing The Shaw Group from a pipe fabrication company into a publicly traded, industrial services powerhouse with a global footprint and a spot on the Fortune 500 list.

After selling the company in 2013, he founded Bernhard Capital Partners, a private equity firm that is now one of the largest in the Gulf South with more than $5.5 billion in assets under management and 21 companies across the country in the energy services, industrial and utilities sector.

Along the way, Bernhard played a prominent role in state Democratic Party politics, engaged in south Louisiana civic and charitable causes and was involved in the lives of his five children and grandchildren.

""We are heartbroken by the unexpected passing of Jim Bernhard,"" said Jeff Jenkins, who co-founded Bernhard Capital Partners and worked with Jim Bernhard for 27 years. ""Jim changed the business landscape of Louisiana like no one else. He created jobs, built companies and opened doors for families across our state in ways that will be felt for generations.""

Jenkins added: ""He was also one of the most generous people I have ever known, always helping others, without any desire for attention or recognition.""

Gov. Jeff Landry remembered Bernhard as one of Louisiana's ""most dynamic and visionary business leaders.""

""His hard work built companies that created jobs, strengthened our economy, and showcased the very best of Louisiana,"" Landry said in a statement. ""Louisiana has lost a giant, but I know his legacy will endure for generations.""

'Tough to sell'

James Mitchell Bernhard Jr. was born April 9, 1954, in Baton Rouge but raised in Lafayette, where his grandfather had started Bernhard Mechanical in 1919. Years later the company would become one of Bernhard Capital’s portfolio assets.

He graduated from LSU in 1976 with a degree in construction management and joined Sunland Services, a pipe fabrication company.

In 1987, he ventured out on his own, acquiring the assets of a pipe fabrication company out of bankruptcy and founding The Shaw Group. Known for his tireless work ethic, he grew the company over the next 25 years into one of Louisiana’s largest and best-known, taking it public in the early 2000s.

At the time of its sale to CB&I in 2013, The Shaw Group had $5.9 billion in revenues and 27,000 employees, including 4,000 in Louisiana.

The Shaw Group was one of Louisiana’s few Fortune 500 companies at the time — today it has even fewer — and in the early 2000s, Bernhard built a gleaming corporate headquarters tower on Essen Lane in Baton Rouge, visible from Interstate 10, which became a point of pride for Baton Rouge and the state.

During a 2018 radio interview on Talk Louisiana, host Jim Engster asked Bernhard whether it was tough for him to sell the Shaw Group, a company he started with two others and $50,000.

“In a public arena, when someone offers you a 75% premium over the value, you either sell the company to them or they get a new CEO.” Nonetheless, he added, “It was tough to sell.”

As significant as The Shaw Group was for Louisiana’s economy and reputation, Bernhard’s more recent venture has been equally important. In 2013, he founded Bernhard Capital Partners with Jenkins and a handful his former top executives from The Shaw Group. The firm began with a single investment fund and four companies focused narrowly on industrial services.

In the years since, Bernhard Capital has launched four additional funds that have raised $5.5 billion from large, institutional investors and created dozens of other companies, some of which it has since sold, in the energy services, industrial, environmental services and utility sector.

It currently has 21 companies under management and is the largest private equity firm between Houston and Atlanta. It has been listed among the largest private equity firms in the world and has some of the highest returns in the U.S.

Tim Barfield, who worked under Bernhard at The Shaw Group in the early 2000s, remembered him as a powerful force in the lives of many business leaders today.

“He provided opportunities to me and many others that changed the trajectories of our lives,” said Barfield, who went on to head CSRS in Baton Rouge. “He was so generous to our community and state. May he rest in peace.”

'Baton Rouge proud, Louisiana committed'

While the owner of a major business, Bernhard chaired Kathleen Blanco’s gubernatorial campaign in 2003 and became chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party in January 2005 while she was governor.

He resigned nine months later after Hurricane Katrina devastated metro New Orleans. Shaw secured contracts to become an important player in the rebuilding effort.

Still, he remained an active force in Louisiana Democratic politics and toyed with running for governor in 2015 and 2019. He deferred to fellow Democrat John Bel Edwards, who won both elections.

In a Talk Louisiana interview in 2018, Bernhard said people often asked him to run for governor, saying he was “the perfect candidate” because he had the ability to fund the campaign himself.

He didn’t describe his political approach in partisan terms. Instead, he said, “We need to work to solve problems, to solve issues. Let’s work together, compromise and move the ball forward.”

Bernhard said he had plenty of offers to set up shop outside of Baton Rouge but said he stayed because he loved the city and LSU, his alma mater.

He said his philosophy was “Baton Rouge proud and Louisiana committed.”

Philanthropy

Bernhard was known for his philanthropy across the state, though much of it was behind the scenes. One prominent exception was The Shaw Center for the Arts in Baton Rouge, a transformative project that helped revitalize the state capital's downtown two decades ago. The Shaw Group contributed $4 million to help fund the building's construction.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/e8/ae8934ad-4298-5489-b9e4-0b01373e126c/5e9d0a546cd62.image.jpg?crop=1211%2C636%2C0%2C389&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-16 22:00:27.548670

By Moses Akaigwe

More stakeholders in the domestic auto industry have lent their voices to the flurry of commendations that have been going to the Senate for the Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill, 2025 which recently scaled through the second reading in the Red Chamber.

Sponsored by the Senator representing Abia North, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, the bill is being commended as a piece of legislation that would guide Nigeria’s journey towards a greener, electrified mobility.

In the latest appreciation, Cedric Masters, Kia Motors Nigeria and Jet Motor Company, last week joined the growing number of automakers to thank the federal lawmakers for the initiative, even as some of the stakeholders also described electric vehicles as the future of mobility, especially in Nigeria and the African continent in general.

Congratulating the Senate and Senator Orji Kalu on the successful second reading of the bill, KIA Motors Nigeria stated that the draft law is in line with President Bola Tinubu’s green mobility initiative

Kia Motors’ commendation was contained in a press statement on Thursday in which the company observed that the bill is a transformative step that aligns perfectly with the President’s Renewed Hope Agenda and the nation’s transition toward sustainable mobility.

The press statement disclosed that as one of Nigeria’s foremost automobile and electric vehicle manufacturers, KIA Motors Nigeria has long anticipated the coming of a legal framework which the bill would lead to.

The automaker assured that with its vehicle assembly plant and commitment to over 70 percent local content production and inclusivity, the company is strategically positioned to support the country’s shift to cleaner, greener transportation.

According to the company, the Electric Vehicle bill would not only create thousands of skilled jobs but also stimulate local manufacturing, reduce the cost of electric vehicles, and power economic growth through sustainable innovation.

The Chief Executive Officer of KIA Motors Nigeria, Jacky Hathiramani. highlighted the likely impact of the legislation, saying,”This bill reflects a decisive commitment by the government of President Tinubu to secure Nigeria’s future through clean energy and industrial growth.

“KIA is fully aligned with this vision and remains ready to collaborate with government agencies, investors, and partners to accelerate the transition to electric mobility.”

”We also extend our deep appreciation to Dr Orji Uzor Kalu for championing the bill and to President Tinubu for his forward-thinking leadership and reaffirm our capacity and readiness to support the government’s implementation efforts, ensuring that Nigerians benefit from affordable, high-quality electric cars, buses and commercial vehicles assembled locally.”

The press statement further assured that with Kia Motors’ proven record of innovation, strong local workforce, and commitment to environmental sustainability, the company stands ready to drive the next chapter of Nigeria’s automotive revolution — one powered by clean energy, local talent, and the Renewed Hope Agenda.

Like Kia Motors, the management of Cedric Masters Group, which owns a Lagos- based auto assembly plant,, also lauded the introduction of the bill.

The Chairman of Cedric Masters Group, Chief Anselm Ilekuba, who is also the National Coordinator of ALCMAN (Automotive Local Content Manufacturers Association of Nigeria), eulogised the Senators for conceiving a legal compass for electric mobility in Nigeria.

Through ALCMAN, Chief Ilekuba has been in the vanguard of the efforts to boost auto parts manufacturing for vehicle production in Nigeria, while at the same time using Celtic Masters to contribute to driving the domestic auto industry towards developing electric vehicle technology.

The industrialist further remarked that it was heartwarming to note that the federal lawmakers were taking steps to encourage the efforts of investors in Nigeria’s auto sector who defy a very challenging atmosphere to operate

He was hopeful that supportive initiatives by the Federal Government, such as the bill by the Senate, would help investments like Cedric Masters’ assembly plant in the Lekki area of Lagos, where the JIM-ISUZU brand of vehicles are produced.

Apart from the rugged 2.4 litre JIM ISUZU Re-Max 4×4 pick-up which has already started making a mark in the light commercial vehicles market as a reliable work horse, Cedric Masters is also ushering into the Nigerian market the Leapmotor brand known for its affordable and tech-focused new energy vehicles (NEVs).

The company is also introducing in the local market the Voyah brand of luxury electric vehicles.

The Cedric Masters Group Chairman also stated, “Our subsidiary, Cedric Clean Energy Solution, which has an electric charge station assembly plant in Lekki, Lagos State, sees this bill as a wonderful development and calls for greater stakeholder involvement, especially with NADDC and ALCMAN.”

“I commend Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for this laudable bill which shows vision and will serve as a cursor to the long-awaited Nigerian Automotive Industry Development Programme.”

The Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill, 2025 was also analysed by Engr. Derek Ewelukwa, the Managing Director of Jet Motor Company, Nigeria’s first electric bus assembler with a plant also in Lekki, Lagos.

Ewelukwa, commended Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for being very thoughtful,, and called for all hands to be on deck to ensure that the draft is passed and signed into law (an act) at the end of the normal process.

He listed the areas in which the act would impact on the industry, including encouraging domestic production and assembly of electric vehicles, which would in turn generate employment opportunities and decrease reliance on imports; as well as speed up the uptake of electric vehicles by private citizens, companies, and public institutions.

The implementation would also lead to the building of a countrywide network of charging stations that incorporate renewable energy sources, in addition to cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric pollution, and dependence on petroleum-based fuels.

The Jet Motor MD, said: “Overall, if the purpose of this bill is achieved, and the shift to EV adoption happens successfully amongst the citizens, it would be a significant relief to the cost of transportation.

“The long term cost of owning and using an EV is significantly lower than that of a comparable ICE vehicle.

“The only immediate drawback I see is that its success hinges on stable electricity supply and affordability of EVs. Without robust financing options, adoption may remain low.

“This is where the Federal Government and its agencies will have to come in and spur up the space by injecting substantial cash into charging infrastructure development as well as tax holidays, subsidies, and waivers for EV businesses. These savings will in turn be passed on to potential EV owners.”

Recalling his personal experience with electric vehicles back in the US in 2021 when he switched his Tesla vehicles from consuming fossil fuel to full battery EV,, Engr. Ewelukwa said he has been “a big advocate of EVs from day one.”

He gleefully remarked, “In my opinion, EVs are the future of the auto industry. Since relocating back to Nigeria, I found it difficult and unsustainable to drive ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. So much so that I had to bring back one of my Tesla vehicles to Nigeria. I currently use this vehicle comfortably in Abuja.”

When the proposed legislation had its second reading on Wednesday, November 5, 2025, at the Senate,the lawmakers overwhelmingly supported Senator Orji Kalu, describing the initiative as a necessary step to diversify the economy and align with global clean energy trends.

The bill targets to provide tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, and subsidies for electric vehicle users and investors; and make it mandatory for all fuel stations to install charging points

When it becomes an act, it would require foreign automakers seeking to sell electric vehicles in Nigeria to partner with licensed local assemblers and establish domestic assembly plants within three years.

It also aims to compel companies to source at least 30 percent of their components locally by 2030, while violations could attract fines of up to 250 million naira per breach, even as unlicensed importers risk penalties of 500 million naira and confiscation of goods.

The act which is expected to position Nigeria as a potential hub for electric vehicles production in Africa, would incentivise investors who establish charging infrastructure by availing them with government grants and tax credits.",https://d1jcea4y7xhp7l.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1002019882.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 22:58:32.227156

House Republicans won’t stop fighting to unleash American energy and keep the U.S. energy dominant by cutting Biden-era energy-crushing and job-killing regulations.","Keeping Violent Criminals Off D.C.’s Streets

Currently, the District of Columbia has a cashless bail policy that prohibits using cash bail as a condition for pre-trial release. This reckless policy allows soft-on-crime progressive judges to release dangerous criminals onto the streets of D.C. with only a promise to not re-offend and show up for their future court date, resulting in multiple arrests and putting public safety at risk.

We cannot allow dangerous criminals to roam the streets freely and threaten the safety of everyone in our nation’s capital while they await trial. It’s past time for D.C. to abandon its soft-on-crime policies and make sure those charged with committing violent crimes remain behind bars to ensure the safety of law-abidding Americans.

This week, House Republicans are continuing our fight to make D.C. safe for visitors and residents by bringing forward legislation that keeps violent and dangerous criminals off our streets.

Our bill would amend the current D.C. Code to mandate the detention of individuals charged with violent and dangerous offenses and implement cash bail for crimes that threaten public safety, such as aggravated assault and obstruction of justice. This legislation codifies Executive Action taken by President Trump to clean up D.C. crime and make our nation’s capital safe again.

Rep. Elise Stefanik’s legislation, H.R. 5214, the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act, amends D.C.’s pre-trial release and detention processes to require mandatory pre-trial detention for defendants charged with violent crimes and for cash bail or bail bonds for defendants charged with certain crimes concerning public safety and order.

Our nation’s capital should set the standard on combatting crime and be safely accessible to the American people – House Republicans are working with President Trump to ensure that’s the case.

Supporting Police Officers and Cleaning Up our Nation’s Capital

While crime skyrocketed in our nation’s capital, Democrats went after the police working to protect the community instead of the criminals putting Americans at risk. In 2022, the D.C. Council passed their Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022, imposing harmful restrictions and requirements on the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) rather than supporting our men and women in uniform.

The D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 allows police officers to be targeted by protestors, bans officers from watching body-camera footage when writing initial incident reports, demands a jury to consider if an officer consulted with mental health, behavioral health, or social workers prior to the use of deadly force, dismisses officers and police union representatives from the Police Complaints Board, and strips officers of collective bargaining rights regarding discipline.

Under the D.C. Council’s emergency legislative powers, these harmful policies have been in place since 2020; meanwhile, D.C. police staffing reached the half-century low as homicides rose to their highest number since 1997. Additionally, juvenile crime in the District has reached historic levels while truancy grows.

Congress has a duty to oversee the governance of D.C. and make sure the MPD is able to effectively fight crime and keep Washingtonians and visitors safe. President Trump has taken significant strides to clean up D.C. streets and make our capital safe again, and House Republicans are likewise committed to restoring law and order in the District. This week, we are bringing forward legislation to reverse dangerous anti-police measures in the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 to deliver the support our law enforcement needs.

Rep. Andrew Clyde’s legislation, H.R. 5107, the Common-Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability Now in DC (CLEAN DC) Act, repeals the D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 which placed harmful and burdensome requirements on the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.

House Republicans will always stand with our men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day to keep our communities safe. Who will Democrats stand with: the police or the criminals?

Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism

Socialism is one of the most destructive ideologies in world history, time and time again proving itself to be a failed experiment that only leads to communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships.

More than 100 million people have been killed as a result of the mass murders and famines that accompany failed socialist states. For example, tens of millions of people died during the Bolshevik Revolution, between 15 and 55 million people died of starvation in the wake of famine caused by China’s Great Leap Forward, over one million people were brutally murdered in Cambodia’s killing fields as a result of their socialist experiment, at least 3.5 million people have starved in North Korea, and more.

Despite the proven dangers of socialism, America is seeing a troubling rise in the harmful ideology, especially with our youth – most recently culminating in the election of radical socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City.

Since 2016, more Democrats have held positive views of socialism than of capitalism, with 66 percent of Democrats now viewing socialism favorably, while only 42 percent view capitalism favorably. Additionally, socialism has seen a rebirth with American youth: 62 percent of Americans between the ages 18 to 29 hold a favorable view of socialism, and 34 percent of communism.

Socialism and the abuses it leads to go against everything our Founding Fathers stood for. We cannot allow history to be ignored and the threat of socialism to grow unchallenged in America. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that denounces the horrors of socialism and reaffirms our commitment to uphold the American ideals of freedom, democracy, and the pursuit of happiness.

H. Con. Res. 58, introduced by Congresswoman Maria Salazar, describes the horrors perpetrated by socialist regimes, denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.

Every member of the House of Representatives should unequivocally condemn socialism in all its forms – will Democrats stand up for American values or cave to the radicals in their base?

Streamlining Permitting for LNG Exports and Facilitating American Energy Dominance

In January 2024, the Biden Administration announced they would be halting approvals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, despite previous studies showing that American LNG exports create net public benefits, protect global energy security, create American jobs, and reduce emissions.

This disastrous decision was a blatant political ploy to satisfy radical climate activists dead set on shutting down American energy production, even though banning LNG exports only increases our dependency on hostile foreign adversaries. It also severely harms our national security, discouraging foreign investment in American LNG production and empowering Russia and Iran to influence LNG prices on the global stage.

Thankfully, the Trump Administration has been working to undo the damage done by the Biden Administration, issuing at least three final LNG export authorizations, and U.S. developers have made final investment decisions on six LNG export projects worth more than $70 billion.

Currently, anyone wanting to import or export U.S. natural gas must get multiple permits, obtaining first approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct, operate, and expand the LNG facility, and second authorization from the Department of Energy (DOE) to import or export natural gas to non-free trade agreement (non-FTA) countries.

We must continue encouraging American energy production and providing our allies with a secure energy source, not making it harder to export American energy with burdensome bureaucracy. House Republicans are bringing legislation to streamline the export permitting process, unleash domestic production and exports, and protect our national security.

Rep. August Pfluger’s legislation, H.R. 1949, the Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act, lifts restrictions on the import and export of natural gas and streamlines the permitting process by getting rid of the requirement for the DOE to authorize exports and giving FERC total authority over the approval process, facilitating American energy dominance and lowering costs.

Will Democrats once again put radical climate activists above the energy security and economic prosperity of the American people, or will they stand with us in our fight to lower energy costs for workers and families?

Expanding U.S. Refinery Capacity and Shoring Up Energy Security

Global demand for liquid fuels is increasing, with demand expected to rise by about 20 million barrels per day by 2050 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). However, under the Biden Administration’s anti-American energy policies and crushing regulations, refineries and America’s refining capacity have suffered.

From 2020 to 2022, the number of U.S. refineries – which are crucial for American energy security, converting crude oil into vital petroleum products and fueling our nation – declined from 135 to 128 and refinery capacity decreased by more than one million barrels of fuel per day. This has resulted in increased refining dependency on foreign nations.

We cannot continue to rely on foreign supplies and risk American energy and national security to appease radical environmentalists. U.S. refineries are vital to our energy independence and to providing the fuels that power America.

House Republicans are bringing legislation to require the National Petroleum Council to study and collect essential information on the role petrochemical refineries play in America and examine opportunities to expand our refinery capacity while identifying risks to refineries.

H.R. 3109, the Researching Efficient Federal Improvements for Necessary Energy Refining (REFINER) Act, introduced by Rep. Bob Latta, bolsters U.S. energy security, reliability, and affordability by requiring the National Petroleum Council to study opportunities and provide recommendations to expand American refining capacity.

House Republicans won’t stop working to bolster America’s energy security by unleashing domestic production and ensuring an abundance of affordable and reliable energy in the U.S.

Reversing Biden’s Lock-Up of National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska

In 2022, Biden’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) replaced a 2020 Trump Administration plan for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) with one that shuts down domestic energy production on the reserve, killing jobs, hurting Alaskan communities, and threatening our energy security.

The Biden BLM’s disastrous 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD) for NPR-A bars oil and gas leasing on nearly half of the reserve – an area specifically designated by Congress for energy production – leaving only 52 percent open for domestic production.

With this harmful plan, the Biden Administration put their “Green New Scam” agenda before the Alaskan people and the wellbeing of our country, ignoring the views of Alaska Native leaders in the region and imposing federal red-tape that blocks some of the state’s best resource development opportunities. The economic impacts from crushing development will only harm Alaska and hardworking Americans, cutting down on the good paying jobs and economic benefits that come with domestic production.

This week, House Republicans are bringing legislation to reverse this burdensome and damaging Biden-era plan to lock up NPR-A. It’s past time we unlock Alaska’s full potential and unleash its extensive energy resources, safeguarding jobs, shoring up energy security, and lowering costs for Americans.

Sen. Dan Sullivan’s legislation, S.J. Res. 80, reverses the Biden Bureau of Land Management's 2022 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) Record of Decision (ROD) for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska that blocks oil and gas leasing on nearly half of the reserve, hurting energy production and crushing job creation.

House Republicans continue working to undo the damage the Biden Administration did to our energy sector and, in turn, our national security.

Reversing a Biden-Era RMP Amendment Crushing the Buffalo Coal Industry

Last November, the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a Resource Management Plan (RMP) Amendment for the Buffalo Field Office located in Buffalo, Wyoming, which guides the management of BLM lands, including land use allocations of areas available for further coal leasing consideration and those that are not.

Staying consistent with their radical ‘Green New Scam’ policies and anti-American energy agenda, the Biden Administration’s RMP Amendment locked up all 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate administered by the Buffalo Field Office, allocating ZERO acres of BLM administered coal as available and making 48.12 billion short tons of coal unavailable for leasing consideration.

Wyoming produces around 40 percent of the nation’s coal, and the industry supports over 4,000 jobs in rural Wyoming, $1.9 billion in labor output through 2048, and millions of dollars in state revenue used to fund public education. This radical RMP Amendment essentially ended coal leasing in the area with the BLM accepting no new coal lease applications – crushing domestic energy production, endangering access to affordable, reliable American energy, killing jobs, and harming the economy in Wyoming.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to overturn the Biden BLM’s disastrous RMP Amendment that crushes domestic production in Wyoming, unleashing American energy development, keeping energy prices affordable and reliable, and protecting Wyoming jobs and economy.

H.J. Res. 130, introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, reverses the rule submitted by Biden’s Bureau of Land Management relating to “Buffalo Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment” that threatens Americans’ access to affordable and reliable energy by locking up 800,000 acres of land and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate, preventing future coal leasing, and blocking access to 48 billion short-tons of coal in Wyoming.

That's why many investment disclosures warn that past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns.

Tesla (TSLA +0.59%) is one such stock. Potential shareholders no doubt look at its returns of 2,900% over the past decade and wonder, ""What if?""

But there are signs that the electric vehicle dominance Tesla once enjoyed has come to an end, and falling earnings coupled with rising costs could hamper the company's growth. That said, Tesla is pursuing new opportunities -- including autonomous systems and robotics -- that have lots of potential

Here's how Tesla is positioning itself for the future and why buying the stock probably won't set you up for life.

Tesla is making big bets on its future

While Tesla's core business is selling electric vehicles, Elon Musk has said that the company's future will be focused on autonomous vehicles (AVs) and humanoid robotics. There's some logic to this bet considering that the global robotaxi industry could reach an estimated $1.4 trillion by 2040 and humanoid robotics are expected to be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050.

The company has already made some progress on these fronts. Tesla has some semi-autonomous capabilities in its vehicles, and the company has a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with human safety drivers in the vehicles. Musk recently stated that safety drivers will be removed in certain parts of Austin in the coming months, and the service will be operational in eight to 10 cities by the end of this year.

What's more, Tesla is already working on the third version of its humanoid robot, called Optimus, which will begin production toward the end of 2026. The company only has hundreds of Optimus bots right now, but one goal that's part of Musk's massive trillion-dollar pay package requires delivering over 1 million bots over the next decade.

It's these prospects that have some investors hoping Tesla's best days might be ahead of it.

Achieving its goals is going to be very expensive

But Tesla is currently facing an uphill battle on multiple fronts. First, the company's earnings declined significantly in the third quarter, with non-GAAP earnings per share falling 31% to $0.50 per share. Its operating margin also dropped dramatically from 10.8% in the year-ago quarter to just 5.8% now.

While the company got a temporary boost in vehicle sales as customers rushed to buy electric vehicles before the EV tax credits expired, the EV industry is now under tremendous pressure now that they're gone. That's coming at a very bad time for Tesla as it ramps up spending to invest in AVs and robotics.

For example, Tesla's research and development costs rose dramatically by 57% to $1.6 billion in the most recent quarter. And there will likely be much more spending if Tesla wants to accomplish its goals of expanding AVs to new cities and building millions of humanoid robots.

It will take billions of dollars more in investments in the coming years for Tesla to make progress on its goals, and if history is an indicator, the company will likely take longer to achieve them than initially planned.

Why Tesla stock probably won't set you up for life

Tesla could achieve its AV and robotics goals, but it will burn through substantial cash to do so, and there's certainly no guarantee of success. Most importantly, it's betting on these two new markets at a time when the company's profitability is declining and the EV industry is facing significant hurdles due to the loss of EV credits.

It's also worth mentioning that Tesla's stock is currently extremely expensive. Its shares currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 297, which is far above the S&P 500's average P/E ratio of approximately 31.

SOMMER: Insurance is a key motivation, she says, for incentivizing fire-prone communities to prevent disasters.","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

California is no stranger to extreme weather. This weekend, the state was hit by a huge storm system, forcing evacuations. It's these type of weather events and wildfires in particular that are driving up the prices of home insurance. That's especially true in Northern California's Lake County, where many companies are just canceling policies. Now community leaders are working to reduce the risks from wildfires. But as Lauren Sommer from NPR's Climate Desk reports, many of the insurance companies aren't taking note.

LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Penny Sidhu is getting a home makeover, which she feels like she won out of the blue.

PENNY SIDHU: I have no words. I'm just, like, shocked.

SOMMER: But it's not a makeover you'd notice standing in her front yard in Kelseyville, California, surrounded by rolling hills.

SIDHU: There's screens on top of the gutters. So now I have new gutters with screens on them so the debris can't get in.

SOMMER: Sidhu's house has been made over to protect against wildfires. She's part of a new California program to make homes less likely to burn. After evacuating from fires three times in the last nine years, Sidhu got concerned about overgrown brush between her and her neighbor's house.

SIDHU: You couldn't even see her roof. Like, it was like our houses were connected. There was huge trees and bushes.

SOMMER: She found out she was eligible for the Lake County Home Hardening Program, which uses state and federal funding. Deanna Fernweh, the program manager, set up an inspection to look for vulnerabilities like those bushes.

DEANNA FERNWEH: So if those were to combust, it would catch both of their roofs on fire. And so we removed all of the vegetation.

SOMMER: It's about protecting the house from embers - tiny bits of burning debris carried by the wind far from a wildfire itself.

FERNWEH: More than 90% of homes catch on fire due to embers, not direct flame. So that is what we highly focus on.

SOMMER: Fernweh's team removed the bark mulch near the walls of Sidhu's house and put in gravel. She'll get a metal gate in her side yard instead of wood.

SIDHU: I would never have been able to afford this. There's just no way I could do it. Especially I'm by myself. There's just no way.

SOMMER: Many of Sidhu's neighbors are in the same boat. The county has a lot of lower-income households. But some have gotten wildfire improvements too because the state program is focused on this neighborhood. Wildfire risk goes way down when many homes participate together. Sidhu hopes that insurance companies will notice that.

SIDHU: People are having such a hard time getting insurance on their houses right now. My daughter just bought a house in Crescent City, and it was a nightmare to get insurance.

SOMMER: But there are no guarantees that companies will keep insuring Sidhu and her neighbors.

JESSICA PYSKA: This insurance crisis is hitting everywhere.

SOMMER: Jessica Pyska is on the Lake County Board of Supervisors. She says in the last decade, about 70% of Lake County has burned. She lost her own home in 2015. And insurance has become a huge problem. Some residents are seeing rates double or are being dropped by their insurance companies.

PYSKA: I know a lot of people that are just going without insurance right now.

SOMMER: Pyska says the county is trying to reduce the wildfire risk with a range of projects. They've improved evacuation routes. They worked with federal and state agencies to reduce flammable vegetation in the forests around them. And there's the home improvement program.

PYSKA: People are trying to do everything that they possibly can to get their rates lower, but it's really not helping much.

SOMMER: Some insurance companies are offering small discounts - 5- or 10% - for homeowners that make their houses safer, but companies don't have to consider the work a whole community does to reduce their risk.

PYSKA: How do we get to the point where the insurers are saying, there's a much lower risk here community-wide - we'll come back, and we'll lower the rates or maybe not raise the rates quite so much.

SOMMER: That problem comes down to information. Nancy Watkins is a consulting actuary with Milliman, a risk analysis firm.

NANCY WATKINS: To really understand if the risk has been reduced, an insurance company would theoretically need information about what my neighbors had done. That's very difficult for an insurance company to know about or to verify.

SOMMER: It's something Watkins is trying to change. She's helping start the Wildland Urban Interface Data Commons. It would aggregate all the community wildfire projects into a big database, one that insurance companies can use to see where the wildfire risk is getting better. She says there's a lot to figure out about how it will work, like protecting consumer privacy and getting insurance companies on board. But it could help those companies provide discounts where they don't right now.

WATKINS: As long as there's a disconnect between what people and communities do to reduce their risk and what they're experiencing from their insurance companies, if that disconnect persists, there's this bias to do nothing. People think, nothing that I do will matter.

SOMMER: Insurance is a key motivation, she says, for incentivizing fire-prone communities to prevent disasters.

After all, while incentives may fade, energy demand is projected to rise sharply over the next few years and decades. And we simply can’t meet that demand without abundant, affordable, resilient, and transparent clean energy. The challenge now is ensuring that solar remains accessible and economically viable without federal incentives.

COMMENTARY

What Happens When Incentives Disappear

The phase-out of the ITC will be a stress test for the solar industry. Nearly half (45%) of Americans say they could not afford solar without federal incentives, and another 33% say it would be a financial stretch. Together, these findings suggest that roughly three-quarters of households would find solar difficult or impossible to afford without financial support. Income disparities deepen the divide: 39% of low-income households would not consider solar, compared to 13% of households earning more than $100,000 (Aurora Solar, 2025).

Yet, despite being one of the most effective clean energy incentives in U.S. history, 43% of Americans say they have heard of the ITC but don’t understand what it does, and one in three have never heard of it at all (Aurora Solar, 2025). Among those who are aware of the credit, 82% underestimated its 30% value, believing it was less than 20%.

So, for many homeowners, the ITC’s expiration may not feel like a loss because they never realized the benefit existed. For installers and developers, its end marks a shift toward strategies that can sustain adoption without depending on tax policy.

The Economics of a Post-ITC Market

The next chapter of solar has to depend less on subsidies and more on innovation. According to Ohm Analytics, residential solar demand is projected to drop by 26% in 2026, with cash- and loan-based purchases declining by nearly half, while third-party ownership (TPO) rises from 45% of installs in 2025 to nearly 70% in 2026. This shift indicates that consumers are seeking financing options that lower upfront risk and simplify decision-making.

On the installer side, the end of the ITC brings new pressure to control costs. Although hardware prices have declined significantly over the years, soft costs remained stubbornly high. They now account for nearly two-thirds of total project expenses, driven by permitting delays, change orders, and customer cancellations (MIT Energy Initiative). Industry data show that change orders alone can add up to roughly $1,200 per project, or about $200,000 annually for a mid-sized installer. Companies that streamline workflows, increase transparency in quoting, and integrate automation into design processes are positioned to succeed in this leaner, post-incentive environment.

The Policy-Proof Future of Solar

If the past two decades of federal support built the foundation for solar adoption, the next two will test its resilience. And the industry is already adapting to become “policy-proof.”

Installers are adopting AI-powered design tools that cut change orders by up to 90%, expanding point-of-sale financing, and providing clear, validated pricing in proposals. This not only cuts costs, but helps solve a persistent problem: According to the Aurora Solar 2025 Solar Snapshot, 41% of homeowners say it is difficult to find a trustworthy installer. By embracing technology and transparency installers can start to close this trust gap and gain consumer confidence in the years ahead.

Things outside the industry’s control could also lend a hand. We’re still in an era of high interest rates, and solar could benefit if they continue to come down: 67% of Millennials and Gen Z say they would be more likely to purchase or finance solar if rates declined, compared to 47% overall (Aurora Solar, 2025). This points to a larger insight, though. Multiple, innovative financing options and transparent business models that meet younger buyers where they are key to a strong solar industry.

Not Shrinking, But Maturing

As the ITC sunsets, we need to shift our focus from what’s ending to what’s beginning. Demand for electrification, energy storage, and distributed generation continues to grow, ensuring that solar will become even more critical to meeting the U.S.’s energy needs. McKinsey projects that total U.S. electricity demand will rise by nearly 25% by 2030, driven by electric vehicles, heat pumps, and expanded domestic manufacturing. That growth cannot be met without distributed solar.

The ITC may be coming to an end, but the momentum it created endures. The future of solar now depends on innovation, transparency, and adaptability to thrive no matter what policies are put in our way.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pexels-rooftop-solar-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 19:58:23.297167

Red Oak: Google’s second Texas data center campus is now online Google announced its Red Oak data center in 2023—its second in the state.","Google announced its largest-ever investment in any U.S. state on Friday, committing $40 billion to Texas through 2027 to add three new data center campuses and make the Lone Star State a centerpiece of its global AI data center footprint.

The announcement came at Google’s data center facility in Midlothian, where Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai joined Gov. Greg Abbott, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly, U.S. Rep. Jake Ellzey, and Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s global head of data center energy.

“We are making a new $40 billion investment in the Lone Star State,” Pichai said at the event. “This includes plans for three new data center campuses, one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County.”

The investment bundles cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, energy capacity initiatives, continued buildout in North Texas, and workforce training programs.

“This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state,” Abbott said. “Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy.” The investment, he said, is “Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state.”

Google makes Texas its AI infrastructure anchor

“Texas will be the centerpiece for AI data centers for Google,” said Abbott.

Pichai explained why Texas was selected for the massive investment. “Data centers of that scale require a few things: good, pro-innovation regulatory environments, land, and especially energy,” he said in Midlothian. “Happily, we found all three in Texas.”

Thanking Abbott for “leading the way,” Pichai added, “They say everything is bigger in Texas, and I think that applies to the golden opportunity with AI, the optimism, the talent, the policy environment, and the innovation needed to lead this new era and create immense benefits for everyone.”

The multi-billion-dollar investment will “create thousands of jobs, provide skills training to college students and electrical apprentices, and accelerate energy affordability initiatives throughout Texas,” he said.

The three new West Texas data centers expand Google’s data center footprint, which already includes Ellis County campuses in Midlothian and Red Oak. Google has maintained a Texas presence for more than 15 years, Pichai said, with thousands of employees across the state and offices in Dallas, Austin, and Houston.

Net-positive power additions to the grid and Google’s “first industrial park”

Energy strategy emerged as a central theme of the announcement, with Google committing to be a net-positive contributor to the Texas grid as it builds out new AI infrastructure.

“When we invest in data centers, part of our core strategy is to invest significantly in new energy capacity, which increases supply and ensures grid abundance for everyone,” Pichai said from the podium. “In Texas, we work with local utility partners to add more than 6,200 megawatts of net new energy generation and capacity to the grid to keep costs low.”

According to Google’s news release, the company has power purchase agreements with energy developers such as AES Corporation, Enel North America, Clearway, ENGIE, Intersect, SB Energy, Ørsted, and X-Elio.

Abbott noted Google has provided a net new addition of five gigawatts of power to the Texas grid so far — and committed to be net positive to the power grid as the build continues, “making sure we have the reliability and the supply that Texas needs to keep the lights on for all of our fellow Texans.”

In terms of energy scale, 5 gigawatts is equivalent to 5,000 megawatts.

One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built directly alongside a new solar and battery energy storage plant. Pichai said Google’s first industrial park, developed through a partnership with Intersect Power, will be co-located at the Haskell data center. “Co-locating energy supply with data center load has some powerful benefits. It can unlock the development of new transmission infrastructure and optimize utilization of the existing grid,” he said.

Google announced its industrial park partnership with Intersect and TPG Rise Climate last year, described as a strategic collaboration to develop “powered land” to allow the data center to run mostly on carbon-free electricity produced nearby.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy on AI’s power demands

James Danly, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy and the second-highest official at the Department of Energy, used the Midlothian announcement to zoom out to the national stakes of AI’s rising power needs.

“We’re going to need 100 gigawatts over the next number of years in order to satisfy the demand as we projected,” he said, noting the investment comes “at the same time as the President’s agenda focuses on ensuring safe, reliable, affordable, secure power for everybody, in abundance.”

In the company’s news release, Danly framed Google’s move as directly tied to that agenda. “This historic investment from Google advances this administration’s goal of winning the AI race,” he said in a statement. “Google is working to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance, economic competitiveness and national security while ensuring that energy remains reliable, affordable and secure.”

Danly also pointed to Texas policy as a key enabler of projects on this scale. “This is a state that has ensured energy abundance for everybody. It has made it possible to deploy new resources rapidly,” he said. “This is a model for how such projects should be done going forward, and the United States is going to be put in a very good position as a result of such projects.”

Pichai also tied the announcement to federal policy and thanked the administration. “We won’t be here without the leadership of President Trump and the White House AI action plan,” he said.

‘We’ve known how great it is’

With the announcement just a few days after Veterans Day, U.S. Rep. Jake Ellzey opened his remarks by sharing Danly’s service record with the crowd. He reminded them that Danly went to Yale, joined the Army, and that the two men served in Iraq at the same time in 2006, where Danly was in combat and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.

Ellzey—a Republican representing Texas’ 6th Congressional District, including Midlothian and the surrounding area—kept his remarks close to home and tied the moment back to the people on stage.

“You’ve come a long way from Madras to Midlothian, and we’re glad that you’re here,” Ellzey told the Google CEO, noting that Pichai took over the company the same year Abbott became governor. “Who knew that today we would be talking about this $40 billion investment in Texas, but also in Midlothian. For many, many years, we’ve known how great it is, and now you guys are seeing it too.”

He also reminded the audience that Abbott’s own story runs through North Texas, pointing out that the governor is from nearby Duncanville and, as a high school senior, was voted “most likely to succeed.”

Ellzey then described the campus for those who hadn’t had a tour. About a year ago, he said, he walked through the buildings behind the stage and was struck by how familiar they felt. “I walked in and said, this looks exactly like an aircraft carrier,” he recalled.

When he asked who the workers were, he was told, “We were nuclear sailors in the United States,” adding that much of the technology is similar to that of a nuclear aircraft carrier. “So you have a very highly skilled, talented group of people working here.”

From there, Ellzey turned to how the project came together and the locals who helped land it.

The congressman named more than a dozen current and former Midlothian mayors and city council members, along with City Manager Chris Dick and others, for supporting the development. “This doesn’t happen without local leaders, citizens, and the employees of Alphabet and Google,” he said. “We all know Midlothian is a great place. Now the rest of the world knows too.”

Then he addressed a question on many minds: How do you power all this?

“A lot of people worry about these data centers. Where is the power going to come from?” he said. “We’re working together with the state, [with Google], and with the Secretary of Energy, to make sure that these places are powered on their own.”

Ellzey summed up what the investment means for residents in a statement released alongside the event. “Google’s investment here in Midlothian is a real boost for our community. It brings good jobs, new opportunities, and steady growth for families across our district,” he said. “Texas keeps showing why it’s the place to build and invest: low taxes, a strong workforce, and a can-do spirit you won’t find anywhere else.”

$30 million energy impact fund for affordability and energy workforce

Beyond the three new data centers, Pichai also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund starting in 2026.

“This fund is designed to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives throughout Texas,” Pichai said. “For the next three years, starting in 2026, we’ll work with community partners and local organizations with a focus on energy costs, weatherization for homes and public schools, and building the energy workforce of the future.”

Google said it will establish a funding application process for community partners and local organizations.

In a news release, the company also detailed water and agriculture commitments tied to the expansion. Once complete, the three new facilities in Armstrong and Haskell counties will use advanced air-cooling technology, limiting water use to site operations such as kitchens, Google said.

Beyond its direct operations, Google is contributing $2.6 million to help Texas Water Trade create and enhance up to 1,000 acres of wetlands along the Trinity–San Jacinto Estuary and deliver approximately 300 million gallons of freshwater annually in southeastern Texas.

Additionally, Google said it is providing more than $2 million to support agriculture in Texas, including a regenerative agriculture program with Indigo Ag in the Dallas–Fort Worth area and an irrigation efficiency project with N-Drip in the Texas High Plains, according to the company.

AI Opportunity Fund: Training 1,700-plus electricians by 2030

The new AI and energy infrastructure will need trained people to build and maintain it, Pichai said.

Google’s workforce development strategy aims to increase the projected pipeline of new electricians in Texas by nearly 110%. “Our data center investments increase the need for electricians to help build that workforce pipeline,” Pichai said. “We are supporting the electrical training ALLIANCE (etA), which will train more than 1,700 new apprentices by 2030.”

That education effort will receive funding from Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund, according to the company. The initiative aims to boost the number of apprentices in Texas, integrate AI tools into the training curriculum, and train both existing electrical workers and apprentices in the state.

“Our country, our world, is going to be hinged to electrons,” Abbott said. The engineers and electricians who will be getting this education, will be needed, “literally, for the rest of their lives,” he added.

Free AI training: Google AI for Education Accelerator

The workforce development builds on the work Google is doing with leading institutions in the state that help prepare students with critical AI and job ready skills, Pichai told attendees.

“We are giving Longhorns, Aggies, Bobcats, and many other Texas-based college students access to Google career certificates and AI training courses at no cost,” he said, adding there’s “no in-state rivalry here.”

According to Google, The University of Texas, Texas A&M, and Texas State University systems, along with Dallas College and South Texas College, are among the universities and colleges in the first cohort of the Google AI for Education Accelerator, giving students, faculty, and staff no-cost access to Google Career Certificates and AI training courses.

Google also committed $7 million in grants to support AI-related initiatives in healthcare, energy, and education across Texas. That includes helping CareMessage enhance rural healthcare access, enabling The University of Texas at Austin and Texas Tech University to address energy challenges, and expanding AI training for Texas educators and students through support to Houston Community College.

To date, Google said it has provided funding to local organizations that have trained more than 1 million residents in digital skills, the company said.

Thousands of construction and permanent jobs

Pichai said the company also supports “countless more jobs” across the state through its work with local businesses. The company’s investments and technologies helped provide more than $50 billion of activity for Texas businesses, nonprofits, publishers, creators, and developers in 2024, according to the company.

Google said it is continuing to invest in its existing Ellis County data centers in Midlothian and Red Oak, as it builds out its three new West Texas facilities. The company’s continued investment in Texas projects over many years will also support thousands of construction jobs, Pichai said.

“This project will do nothing but expand Texas’ lead nationally for new jobs,” Abbott said, noting the state’s continued number one rankings for the most new jobs, the best state for doing business, and the most economic development projects.

“We appreciate all the jobs that you’re bringing here, but equally appreciate the training, the high skilled level training is going to be needed to fulfill these jobs, he said.

Abbott also leaned into the idea of the state as a fast-moving partner.

“Texas is a partner with our businesses, large and small, and we will insist on continuing to move at the speed of business so that you will finish this project ahead of schedule and under budget,” Abbott said.

AI powering everyday Texas businesses

Abbott moved the conversation from megawatts and megaprojects to everyday life.

“Some people are confused about what AI really does, and this term ‘hyperscalers,'” he said. “Your local McDonald’s is going to be using it to better enable their business to function. Your local stores, your local grocery stores, your local HEB, and things like that are all going to be operating better because of AI generated right here in the middle of Texas.”

Pichai connected the same dots from Google’s side of the house, tying the new infrastructure to services people already use.

“Data centers power the Google products people use every day: search, YouTube, maps, and the Gemini app,” he said. “And now they are powering an exciting new era of AI innovation that is leading scientific breakthroughs, including new cancer therapies and drug discoveries.”

Pichai also pointed to other Google-backed services expanding across the state.

“Waymo, the world’s first autonomous ridesharing service is available in Austin, and we plan to expand to Dallas next year. Our growing delivery service, Wing, and Walmart are completing thousands of deliveries each week in the Dallas area,” he said. “Our growing Dallas cloud region delivers high-performance, low-latency services to companies like NRG Energy.”

Google launched its Dallas Cloud Region in 2022 as part of a global network of 42 cloud regions that businesses and organizations use to build and scale AI-powered solutions.

Alphabet’s life science offshoot, Verily, also moved its headquarters from California to Dallas in 2024.

Local officials embrace “generational investment”

Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s global head of data center energy and a Texas native, told the audience that in her 10 years at the company, she’s seen how data center projects can affect communities like Midlothian and Red Oak.

Google has a “resolute strategy to ensure that Texas continues to lead the American Revolution,” she said, “through next generation, AI infrastructure, a robust energy and power market, and, most importantly, a future-ready talent pool.” She added that local leaders and community partners are essential to making projects like this possible.

Officials from Armstrong and Haskell counties—the Texas communities set to host Google’s newest data centers—framed the company’s commitment as transformational.

In a statement, Armstrong County Judge Adam Ensey called the announcement of a major Google data center campus a “generational opportunity that puts the West Texas region directly in the forefront of the global digital economy” by powering the future of innovation alongside the community’s farming and ranching heritage.

Haskell County Judge Kenny Thompson added that Google’s investment in his community will transform the quality of life for its citizens and “provide long term stability” for all cities within the county infrastructure, offering “top-tier” employment opportunities for people to remain in the county.

Google’s first Texas data center: Midlothian

As Google looks west to new campuses in Armstrong and Haskell counties, Dallas-Fort Worth leaders say the company’s existing footprint has already reshaped parts of the region.

Midlothian’s data center story dates back to a 375-acre land acquisition in Railport Business Park reported in 2018. Google officially announced its plans to invest $600 million to develop its first Texas data center in 2019, with a groundbreaking ceremony that brought together local leaders and company officials.

Current Midlothian Mayor Justin Coffman said Google’s commitment has extended well beyond the “facility fence line.” The company’s presence is a “catalyst for long-term economic development, not only through capital investment but by attracting the kind of high-tech ecosystem that diversifies our economy and creates sustainable opportunities for the next generation of Midlothian families,” he said in a statement.

Red Oak: Google’s second Texas data center campus is now online

Google announced its Red Oak data center in 2023—its second in the state. On Friday, Goothe company also announced that the first building of the Red Oak campus in Ellis County is now operational.

Red Oak Mayor Mark Stanfill described the project as a partnership built on shared values. Beyond Google’s capital investment in Red Oak, Stanfill said the company has made a commitment to the community with support for the Red Oak Public Schools and the new Maker Space at the Red Oak Public Library.

“These contributions are equipping our students and residents with the high-demand digital skills necessary for the modern workforce, guaranteeing that the jobs created here benefit the people who live here,” Stanfill said.

“Investing in America”

Google said the investment is part of its “Investing in America” initiative, which is “furthering American innovation through major investments in technical infrastructure, research and development, expanded energy capacity for an AI-driven economy, and workforce development to help the U.S. continue to lead the world in AI.”

The move also puts Texas deeper into the national AI infrastructure race.

Last week, Anthropic also announced a $50 billion plan for new U.S. data centers, with initial sites planned for Texas and New York. In October, Meta said it would invest $1.5 billion in a new AI data center in El Paso—its third in Texas—bringing its total data center investment in the state to about $10 billion. OpenAI’s Stargate facility in Abilene—announced at the White House in January in a joint venture with Oracle and Softbank—is set to become the “world’s largest AI supercluster,” with five additional U.S. sites planned.

“We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen,” Abbott said.

November 15, 2025

As generous and readily available as local land grants were, the Roaring Fork Valley was small potatoes compared with enormous public land grants that mark vast Western landscapes today and could foreshadow a similar trend if the political powers that be in Washington take on the directives and intentions of the current Trump administration.

“… a shady world of back-room deals, special interests and cronyism.”

— Erica Rosenberg, Western Lands Project

The future of federal public lands lies in the hands of the U.S. Congress as empowered by the American public. Whatever winds of influence and ideology blow through Washington also stir across vast acreages of American lands in the public domain of the commons.

In Aspen, Pitkin County and the greater Roaring Fork Valley, land giveaways have been many, although nothing near the scale of the decades preceding Aspen’s founding when, throughout the American West, land grants were excessive and often rife with fraud and scandal. By the time Aspen was settled in the 1880s, the outrages of earlier land grants had received pushback by a concerned public and were acted upon by congressional oversight that ended the most egregious giveaways.

Still, plenty of public land was doled out regionally to mining interests, homesteaders, railroads, schools, churches and others for what today seem like absurdly low valuations. An Aspen Journalism analysis conducted by Data Editor Laurine Lassalle of records available through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), General Land Office and Pitkin County turned up 1,175 patents issued in Pitkin County between 1880 and 1900. Information below is based on a further review of 97 of those patents.

For example, Roaring Fork Valley rancher Fred Light (1856-1931) filed for 160 acres of public lands in 1883 and, in 1886, paid $200 when the patent was approved. Light bought the land under a federal provision that invited homesteaders to file for patent under the 1820 Sale Cash Entry Act. The price was $1.25 per acre, about $40 per acre in today’s dollars.

Light’s “Box L Ranch,” in the Capitol Creek Valley, grew by additional acquisitions, including Light’s purchase of his wife’s family’s nearby ranch. A tribute written about Light as a civic leader recounted the profitability and size of his holdings. “Owning and operating with skill and success one of the finest ranches in Pitkin County, which is of ample size, comprising nine hundred and forty acres, and sufficiently fertile and productive to yield abundantly of cereals and hay and liberally support large numbers of cattle and horses. Frederick Light, of near Snow Mass, is so situated that he may laugh adversity to scorn and feel secure of an expanding and substantial prosperity during the remainder of his days.”

Light’s former homestead has, of course, escalated in value since his ownership. Today, the average value per acre in the Capitol Creek Valley is $69,000 for agricultural properties and $171,500 for agricultural/residential, according to an analysis of Pitkin County Assessor’s Office records.

Under a different federal land grant program, mining claims were granted to anyone who could prove that a property was economically viable, a stipulation of the Mining Law of 1872. Under this law, which is still on the books and widely considered antiquated, miners paid $5 per acre for both surface and mineral rights. Filers would often accrue multiple claims, as did a number of local partnerships from the early 1880s in Aspen’s first acquired mineral patents.

In 1884, a partnership of 10 individuals — including Josiah Deane, Aspen’s first lawyer and later patriarch of the T-Lazy-7 Ranch on Maroon Creek — was issued a patent on 4.49 acres for a mineral lode called “Mountain Ranger,” located near Little Annie Basin on the backside of Aspen Mountain. They paid $22.45 on the location claim first filed in 1881, the year the city of Aspen was incorporated with Deane’s legal guidance.

In 1884, a six-way partnership filed for a patent on a 5.85-acre mineral patent claim named “Grand Prize,” for which they paid $29.25. The partnership included David R.C. Brown and Henry “Grandpap” Cowenhoven, two of Aspen’s founding fathers who had arrived here in the summer of 1880 by wagons over Taylor Pass — the first wagons to enter the Roaring Fork Valley.

Brown is recorded in another partnership filed in 1887 with three others for the “Monongahila,” a mineral lode of 8.31 acres for which they paid $41.55. Brown and Cowenhoven partnered again in 1889 with four others on a claim called “Idlewild” of 13.04 acres for which they paid $65.20. Brown and Cowenhoven (sometimes in the name of Cowenhoven’s wife, Margaret, and Brown’s wife, Catherine, the daughter of the Cowenhovens’) appear in numerous entries, attributing to sound investments that made them Aspen’s first self-made millionaires.

Another Aspen namesake, Henry Tourtelotte, also appears in a number of entries, establishing patents on claims named “Tanner,” “Buckhorn,” “Castle” and “Silver Bell.” Many of these claim names are familiar today as mountain peaks, ski runs and campgrounds. Another local mining scion, Horace Augustus Warner (HAW) Tabor, shows up in many records associated with Montezuma Basin and the Montezuma claim, a mine he owned that remains visible today at a nosebleed altitude high above Castle Creek. Tabor, known as “The Silver King of Leadville,” brought his entrepreneurial reputation to Aspen along with an opera singer named Baby Doe with whom he had a notorious love affair.

Prominent founding Aspenites David Hyman and Jerome B. Wheeler are also listed in numerous patent entries as among the earliest investors in Aspen mining claims such as “Mose,” “Little Maggie,” “Dolly Dot,” “Morning Star,” “Little Nell,” “Alaska,” “Siberia” and “Durant.” Hyman and Wheeler represented Eastern capital, which was essential to Aspen’s development and which enabled the nascent city to sustain ore production years before the city’s two railroads ran tracks to Aspen and gave it economic viability. Hyman was a prominent lawyer from Cincinnati and was Aspen’s first major mining investor. Wheeler, for whom the Hotel Jerome and the Wheeler Opera House are named, was married into the Macy family wealth, owners of New York City’s first department store.

The Smuggler Mining Co., whose name still marks the mountain and open space playground bounding Aspen to the east, shows patents that provided access and ownership to one of Aspen’s richest silver mines. It was from the Smuggler Mine in 1893 that the largest-ever nugget of almost-pure silver, weighing more than 1,800 pounds, was broken into three pieces so it could be extracted and paraded on a horse-drawn wagon through the thriving city at the verge of the Silver Crash of 1893 when silver was demonetized and the U.S. currency shifted to the gold standard, abruptly and dramatically curtailing Aspen’s thriving mining industry.

Today, historic patented mining claims hold far-different valuations, not for industrial mining potential, but as real estate valued as high-end properties in Aspen’s resort economy. For what the records show as “mines” in Aspen, the valuation goes from an historic low of $4.50 per acre to $500,000 per acre today.

The Denver & Rio Grande Western (D&RGW) and the Colorado Midland built their tracks to Aspen from Leadville, surmounting the Continental Divide on trestles, through tunnels and around winding switchbacks, the construction of which required monumental physical labor. Those rights-of-way remain public thoroughfares today as the Rio Grande Trail (D&RGW) and Highway 82 (Colorado Midland).

The railroads were granted swaths of public lands as an incentive to build tracks and open the West to resource development. Roaring Fork commerce served silver mining and agriculture for which two competing railroads laid tracks over and through the mountains. Unlike earlier railroad ventures in the U.S. that brought commerce and trade to the nation and received vast land grants, Aspen’s two local railroads were granted only their rights-of-way, which still added up to considerable acreage, albeit linear and confined to specific corridors.

Cashing out the commons

As generous and readily available as local land grants were, the Roaring Fork Valley was small potatoes compared with enormous public land grants that mark vast Western landscapes today and could foreshadow a similar trend if the political powers that be in Washington take on the directives and intentions of the current Trump administration.

In a comprehensive 2009 report published by the Western Lands Project, “Carving Up the Commons: Congress & Our Public Lands,” its author, Janine Blaeloch, lays out the history of public land divestitures and describes the many ways public lands can become privatized, something the Trump administration has been applying as a means of capitalizing on extractive national assets. This is not the first time a Republican administration has attempted to commoditize the commons.

“Ronald Reagan’s Interior Secretary, James Watt, famously proposed during Reagan’s presidency (1981-1989) that public lands be sold to pay down the federal deficit,” Blaeloch wrote. “The Bush administration’s (2001-2009) budget for 2007 called for the sale of $800 million worth of U.S. Forest Service lands over five years and $182 million in public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the same time period.

“These periodic high-profile, sweeping, ideologically driven land disposal schemes gain the public’s attention because they are so over the top. What the public is largely not aware of is the fact that smaller scale disposal schemes are being enacted every day — often by the same politicians who declaim their love for the environment and public land.”

Legislative initiatives are receiving strong encouragement from the current Trump administration to parcel and sell off, trade or otherwise divest national public lands and put them into private hands, severing existing protections, means of preservation and ultimately public access. Although such current directives may lead to a new precedent of commoditization, they are part of a long and controversial history.

On April 23, historian and blog phenomenon Heather Cox Richardson wrote in her daily “Letters From an American” a warning that the Department of Agriculture (which administers the U.S. Forest Service) and the Bureau of Land Management (which is under the Department of the Interior) have been gearing up for a wholesale liquidation of the American commons.

“Today,” wrote Cox Richardson, “the White House under President Donald J. Trump celebrated Earth Day by announcing that the White House champions ‘opening more federal lands and waters for oil, gas and critical mineral extraction.’”

Cox Richardson pointed out that, in fact, public lands already benefit the nation by generating billions of dollars a year for the United States through tourism.

“Since the 1970s,” she wrote, “the right wing has come to see the public ownership of lands as an affront to the idea that individuals should be able to use the resources they believe God has put there for them to use.

“Developers have encouraged that ideology, for privatization of America’s Western lands has always meant that they ended up in the hands of a few wealthy individuals.”

The conservative political agenda outlined in Project 2025, she noted, calls for a giveaway to oil and gas and mining interests by “opening up more of our federal land to energy development, rolling back protections on federal lands, and selling off more land to private developers.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum made it clear in his January confirmation hearings, Cox Richardson wrote, “that he sees selling the public lands as a source of revenue, referring to them as ‘America’s balance sheet.’”

“We’ve got $36 trillion in debt,” Burgum said, as quoted by Cox Richardson, “but we never talk about the assets, and the assets are the land and minerals. The Interior Department has got close to 500 million acres of surface, 700 million acres of subsurface, and over 2 billion acres of offshore. That’s the balance sheet of America. I believe we ought to have a deep inventory of all the assets in America. We ought to understand … what [is] our assets: $100 trillion, $200 trillion? We could be in great shape as a country.”

Bipartisan support for public lands

The Trump-era initiative to monetize public lands hit a roadblock, however, after bipartisan support for public lands overwhelmed the direction Burgum and the Trump administration had fomented both as an ongoing policy directive and as described in the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill, which was voted in by Congress and signed into law by the president July 4.

A draft version of that bill had called for selling 0.5% to 0.75% of U.S. Forest Service and BLM lands in 11 Western states and for selling 0.25% to 0.5% of BLM lands within 5 miles of the border of a U.S. population center.

“A proposal to sell federal public lands,” Caitlyn Kim on Colorado Public Radio News reported June 29, “has officially been taken out of the Republicans’ spending and tax bill after facing strong pushback from hunters, fishermen, outdoor recreation users and, most importantly, Republicans in the U.S. Senate and House.”

U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the chief elected Republican advocate for the sell-off, announced the removal of the public lands divestiture from the bill, blaming the decision on the budget reconciliation process and explaining that he could not get a safeguard to guarantee that the land would be sold only to American families.

CPR News reported that Lee “said he continues to believe the federal government ‘owns far too much land’ that he said is mismanaged and that ‘massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there.’ He indicated that he wasn’t giving up altogether, adding that he would work with President Donald Trump to ‘put underutilized federal land to work for American families.’”

However, according to the CPR report, “the decision [to delete public-land sales] also came after other Senate Republicans from the West said they opposed the idea and would offer an amendment to get it taken out of the bill. Five House Republicans also said they would vote against the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill if it remained in.”

Colorado lawmakers celebrated the removal of public-land sales from the GOP bill as a defining endorsement for the value most Americans feel toward protecting the American commons. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “The American people — and our public lands — have won!”

CPR News reported that Neguse and Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.) had issued a joint statement opposing public-land sales in an acknowledgment of unity for protecting a key American legacy that crosses the aisles of Congress. “Republican or Democrat — representing red, purple or blue districts — one sentiment continues to ring true: Public lands are not for sale.”

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “This is a huge victory for Colorado and the West. Thank you to everyone who made their voice heard and fought back against this dangerous provision. America’s public lands belong to all of us.”

“Protecting public lands is the most nonpartisan issue in the country,” Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited, said in a statement quoted by CPR News. “This is certainly not the first attempt to privatize or transfer our public lands, and it won’t be the last. We must stay vigilant and defend the places we love to fish, hike, hunt and explore.”

Taking a stand on the land

Despite this most recent halt of public land sales, the threat is far from over, warns Blaeloch, whose 20-year advocacy mission before the Western Lands Project ceded its role to Wild Earth Guardians in 2016 was to “scrutinize public land trades, sales, giveaways and any project that would cede public land, and their impacts on habitat and wildlife, natural resources, land use and communities. The goal of Western Lands Project is to keep public lands public.”

“We are about to return to the Golden Age of land acquisitions for private benefit,” Blaeloch said in an Aspen Journalism interview in April. In her focused role as public lands defender, Blaeloch said, “We realized that the Forest Service and BLM conduct hundreds of land deals every year, mostly without public involvement. I like clarity and transparency, and I thought it was unfair that deals were being made without the public interest.”

Erica Rosenberg, a former president of Western Lands Project, concludes in the introduction to Blaeloch’s report: “Congressional processes threaten to trade away, sell or give away our public land heritage — piece by piece — through a shady world of back-room deals, special interests and cronyism.”

So, Blaeloch, digging into her background as a career environmental planner, has pushed back with the goal of making federal land management agencies accountable by tracking land deals, educating the public at the grassroots, and also by educating Congress on what has long been a veiled aspect of American land use on the federal level.

Free land for railroad and lumber industries

Blaeloch’s report for the Western Lands Project stated that the most opportune era in U.S. history for collusion in acquiring public lands dirt cheap or at no cost at all took place from the mid-1800s up to the early 1900s through manipulative deals benefitting large railroad interests and the fast-growing lumber industry.

“Between 1850 and 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the federal government granted 131 million acres of public land to railroad corporations as incentive for westward expansion. These railroad land grants comprised one of the largest categories of public land disposal in U.S. history, after cash sale, homestead grants to individuals, and grants to the states for education and other purposes.”

For example, Blaeloch reports, “the Northern Pacific Railroad, which was to construct its line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Tacoma, Washington, was granted 38.9 million acres, including 9.6 million acres in Washington state. Several other land grants were added to what would more than a century later become the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe Railroad, for an additional total of more than 47 million acres.”

These generous railroad land grants were typically given in alternating square miles extending out from the railroad lines and forming a “checkerboard” land-ownership pattern of public/private land that is still visible on many maps and to anyone who chances to gaze out the window of an airplane while flying over the clear-cut forests of the Pacific Northwest.

Land giveaways to railroads were originally intended to encourage Western settlement as the American frontier expanded. It was assumed that land along the railroad lines would become desirable, enabling the railroads and federal government to capitalize by selling their alternating public/private parcels to settlers who would benefit from nearby rail service.

“In fact,” writes Blaeloch, “the railroads kept much of their grant land, and the federal government designated many of its checkerboards as national forest. Nearly all of the railroad land ‘grants’ were in fact intended to be temporary transfers of public land that the railroads were supposed to sell in turn to ‘actual settlers’ to raise money for railroad construction.”

Some railroad companies kept their land grants even though they failed to build, and some transferred former public lands and the wealth they generated to cronies, including elected officials.

“By 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the public had grown disgusted with the scandals and waste flowing from the railroad land grants, and this particular brand of public land giveaway ceased. By this time, too, the public was increasingly concerned about having reached the limits of free land and resources, and there was great controversy around the rapid liquidation of the country’s forests.”

By the end of the 19th century, the debate between forest preservation and utilitarian wise use was at full pitch. Preservation was strongly advocated by Sierra Club founder John Muir and his disciples. Utilitarian wise use was advocated by Gifford Pinchot, the country’s first Forest Service chief under President Theodore Roosevelt. Timber and mining industries actively lobbied for Pinchot’s view of the land as commodity, countering Muir’s view of the natural landscape as a necessary and valid public benefit.

Despoiling the garden

In his 1982 book, “Westward in Eden: The Public Lands and the Conservation Movement,” author William K. Wyant, a former Washington correspondent for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, raises, as a popular conception, the idea of the land as ultimately exploitable: “The American has usually seen real estate as expendable,” he writes. “It is something of which there is assumed to be plenty more … somewhere else.”

When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, writes Wyant, the Republican mandate was to shrink government and its influences, and to cut regulations on industry. This afforded a propitious launch of the Sagebrush Rebellion, which advocated shifting federal lands in the West to the states. “The United States had at the outset an incomparable Garden of Eden to dress and keep, as the Old Testament phrases it,” wrote Wyant. “Its husbandry has been at sometimes profligate, greedy and short-sighted and at other times blessed with extraordinary vision.”

Wyant idealistically describes the continental United States as a vast and pristine wilderness, “a domain of incredible richness — virgin forests, great rivers, the prairies and high plains, the shining Rockies, the arid and sandy wastes and the golden Pacific shore. The early settlers found it majestic and unspoiled, and they plunged into it, defiant of restraints.”

But without restraints, the commons suffered immeasurable abuse and exploitation, as a statement from Pinchot made clear in the early 20th century: “Outside the tropics, American forests were the richest and most productive on Earth, and the best able to repay good management. But nobody had begun to manage any part of them with an eye to the future. On the contrary, the greatest, the swiftest, the most efficient and the most appalling wave of forest destruction in human history was then swelling to its climax in the United States; and the American people were glad of it.”

Rapacious companies such as logging giant Weyerhaeuser saw forested public lands not as cathedrals, as did Muir, but as wood lots. By 1974, cites Wyant, Weyerhaeuser owned outright more than 5.5 million acres, a holding bigger than the state of Massachusetts.

U.S. Sen. Gale McGee (1915-92) who served in Congress from 1959 to 1977 as one of the last Democrats to hail from Wyoming, in testimony in 1971, said, “Today, the once-great forests of our nation have been depleted to the point that would shame Paul

Bunyan. It is time to cease measuring the value of our public forests on the scale of board-feet of timber.”

Vast land giveaways were enabled by the 1862 Railroad Act, writes Wyant, when a number of private railroad companies were allocated $65 million in federal loans and handed a total 110 million acres of public domain. In 1864, an even more generous provision was made when the Northern Pacific Railroad, then building a 2,128-mile line from St. Paul to Tacoma received millions of acres of public lands, including about one-fourth of the state of North Dakota and 15% of Montana.

This largesse was coupled with political influence from railroad magnates who lobbied Congress for more land. Support for outrageous public behests also came from politicians who favored rail subsidies in exchange for locating lines in cities and towns that benefitted their constituents in blatant acts of patronage. Industry and business were in on the take at the expense of the commons.

“All in all,” writes Wyant, “Congress gave to the railroads an area nearly twice the size of Colorado and one-third as large as Alaska.” Another gift of the commons came to the railroads in the Forest Management Act of 1897, which allowed land-holders within newly designated and protected forest reserves to exchange, acre-for-acre, their holdings for lands that were outside the reserves.

Under this act, writes Wyant, rail barons were permitted to swap millions of acres of mountainous, desert, cutover or otherwise useless land for “in lieu” timber acreage of far greater value. The railroads then made deals with lumber companies by not only selling their holdings, but transporting for a profit the timber that was harvested from them. Loggers and railroads latched onto the mutual benefits of collusion in the exploitation of public lands, with no evident moral, ethical or ecological considerations.

After a hue and cry of protest from rising ranks of conservationists, the “in lieu” provision was repealed in 1905. However, eight years of rampant profiteering had already privatized huge chunks of the commons.

“In addition to the scars on the land,” writes Blaeloch, “the behavior pattern, too, was carried forward, and the companies established a paradigm that brought them enormous profits at the expense of the public interest, neatly disguised as ‘win-win’ deals. It is a pattern that shows itself time and again in land deals driven by politics, privilege and greed.”

A regional comparison is necessary to grasp the scale of land acquisitions by logging companies: The White River National Forest covers 2.3 million acres, one of the largest forests in the United States. The Emmerson family, which owns and operates Sierra Pacific Industries, a family legacy company since 1949 that logs usable lumber after forest fires and sells it to lumber retailers, owns 2.4 million acres in three Western states: California, Oregon and Washington. How did one family carve out of the American commons acreage greater than the largest national forest in Colorado? Timber.

Still, Wyant surmises, rising ranks of professional and educated conservationists have achieved national influence in the aftermath of public lands feeding frenzies. “An impressive machinery for the defense of the environment and public lands has been built,” he concludes. “Until it is more firmly in place and has the steady acceptance of the American people, we shall owe a heavy debt to the corporal’s guard of environmental lawyers and professional conservationists who man the ramparts while others sleep.”",https://s0.wp.com/_si/?t=eyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvczAud3AuY29tXC9pXC9ibGFuay5qcGciLCJ0eHQiOiJDb3lvdGUgR3VsY2giLCJ0ZW1wbGF0ZSI6ImhpZ2h3YXkiLCJmb250IjoiIiwiYmxvZ19pZCI6MjIzNTg4NX0.c9FY6ukBzqqbZLFtzGkgYmc-PXMm5LZtBxVTZM5Qm3UMQ,N,,2025-11-16 21:59:29.234474

The question is: Can our policymakers be as realistic in their assessment of missile defense as the makers of a major Hollywood movie?","The Wrath of the Con Man

Kathryn Bigelow’s new nuclear thriller, A House of Dynamite, has been criticized by some experts for being unrealistic, most notably because it portrays an unlikely scenario in which an adversary chooses to attack the United States with just a single nuclear-armed missile. Such a move would, of course, leave the vast American nuclear arsenal largely intact and so invite a devastating response that would undoubtedly largely destroy the attacker’s nation. But the film is strikingly on target when it comes to one thing: its portrayal of the way one U.S. missile interceptor after another misses its target, despite the confidence of most American war planners that they would be able to destroy any incoming nuclear warhead and save the day.

At one point in the film, a junior official points out that U.S. interceptors have failed almost half their tests, and the secretary of defense responds by bellowing: “That’s what $50 billion buys us?”

In fact, the situation is far worse than that. We taxpayers, whether we know it or not, are betting on a house of dynamite, gambling on the idea that technology will save us in the event of a nuclear attack. The United States has, in fact, spent more than $350 billion on missile defenses since, more than four decades ago, President Ronald Reagan promised to create a leak-proof defense against incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Believe it or not, the Pentagon has yet to even conduct a realistic test of the system, which would involve attempting to intercept hundreds of warheads traveling at 1,500 miles per hour, surrounded by realistic decoys that would make it hard to even know which objects to target.

Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists has pointed out that the dream of a perfect missile defense — the very thing Donald Trump has promised that his cherished new “Golden Dome” system will be — is a “fantasy” of the first order, and that “missile defenses are not a useful or long-term strategy for defending the United States from nuclear weapons.”

Grego is hardly alone in her assessment. A March 2025 report by the American Physical Society found that “creating a reliable and effective defense against even [a] small number of relatively unsophisticated nuclear-armed ICBMs remains a daunting challenge.” Its report also notes that “few of the main challenges involved in developing and deploying a reliable and effective missile defense have been solved, and… many of the hard problems we identified are likely to remain so during and probably beyond” the 15-year time horizon envisioned in their study.

Despite the evidence that it will do next to nothing to defend us, President Trump remains all in on the Golden Dome project. Perhaps what he really has in mind, however, has little to do with actually defending us. So far, Golden Dome seems like a marketing concept designed to enrich arms contractors and burnish Trump’s image rather than a carefully thought-out defense program.

Contrary to both logic and history, Trump has claimed that his supposedly leak-proof system can be produced in a mere three years for $175 billion. While that’s a serious chunk of change, analysts in the field suggest that the cost is likely to be astronomically higher and that the president’s proposed timeline is, politely put, wildly optimistic. Todd Harrison, a respected Pentagon budget analyst currently based at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, estimates that such a system would cost somewhere between $252 billion and $3.6 trillion over 20 years, depending on its design. Harrison’s high-end estimate is more than 20 times the off-hand price tossed out by President Trump.

As for the president’s proposed timeline of three years, it’s wildly out of line with the Pentagon’s experience with other major systems it’s developed. More than three decades after it was proposed as a possible next-generation fighter jet (under the moniker Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF), for example, the F-35, once touted as a “revolution in military procurement,” is still plagued by hundreds of defects, and the planes spend almost half their time in hangars for repair and maintenance.

Proponents of the Golden Dome project argue that it’s now feasible because of new technologies being developed in Silicon Valley, from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. Those claims are, of course, unproven, and past experience suggests that there is no miracle technological solution to complex security threats. AI-driven weapons may be quicker to locate and destroy targets and capable of coordinating complex responses like swarms of drones. But there is no evidence that AI can help solve the problem of blocking hundreds of fast-flying warheads embedded in a cloud of decoys. Worse yet, a missile defense system needs to work perfectly each and every time if it is to provide leak-proof protection against a nuclear catastrophe, an inconceivable standard in the real world of weaponry and defensive systems.

Of course, the weapons contractors salivating at the prospect of a monstrous payday tied to the development of Golden Dome are well aware that the president’s timeline will be quite literally unmeetable. Lockheed Martin has optimistically suggested that it should be able to perform the first test of a space-based interceptor in 2028, three years from now. And such space-based interceptors have been suggested as a central element of the Golden Dome system. In other words, Trump’s pledge to fund contractors to build a viable Golden Dome system in three years is PR or perhaps PF (presidential fantasy), not realistic planning.

Who Will Benefit from the Golden Dome?

The major contractors for Golden Dome may not be revealed for a few months, but we already know enough to be able to take an educated guess about which companies are likely to play central roles in the program.

The administration has said that Golden Dome will be built on existing hardware and the biggest current producers of missile defense hardware are Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon (a major part of RTX Corporation). So, count on at least two of the three of them. Emerging military tech firms like SpaceX and Anduril have also been mentioned as possible system integrators. In other words, one or more of them would help coordinate development of the Golden Dome and provide detection and targeting software for it. The final choice for such an extremely lucrative role is less than certain, but as of now Anduril seems to have an inside track.

Even after the breakup of the Donald Trump/Elon Musk bromance, the tech industry still has a strong influence over the administration, starting with Vice President JD Vance. He was, after all, employed and mentored by Peter Thiel of Palantir, the godfather of the recent surge of military research and financing in Silicon Valley. Thiel was also a major donor to his successful 2022 Senate campaign, and Vance was charged with fundraising in Silicon Valley during the 2024 presidential campaign. Emerging military tech moguls like Thiel and Palmer Luckey, along with their financiers like Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, view Vance as their man in the White House.

Other military tech supporters in the Trump administration include Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen Feinberg, whose company, Cerberus Capital, has a long history of investing in military contractors and is already pressing to reduce regulations on weapons firms in line with Silicon Valley’s wish list; Michael Obadal, a senior director at the military tech firm Anduril, who is now deputy secretary of the Army; Gregory Barbaccia, the former head of intelligence and investigations at Palantir, who is now the federal government’s chief information officer; Undersecretary of State Jacob Helberg, a former executive at Palantir; and numerous key members of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which took a wrecking ball to civilian bodies like the U.S. Agency for International Development while sparing the Pentagon significant cuts.

Some analysts foresee a funding fight in the offing between those Silicon Valley military tech firms and the Big Five firms (Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and RTX) that now dominate Pentagon contracting. But the Golden Dome project will have room for major players from both factions and may prove one area where the old guard and the Silicon Valley military tech crew join hands to lobby for maximum funding.

The nation’s premier defense firms and missile manufacturers will likely enjoy direct access to Golden Dome, since the project is expected to be headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, the “Pentagon of the South.” That self-described “Rocket City” houses the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and a myriad of defense firms (including Lockheed Martin, RTX, General Dynamics, and Boeing). It will also soon host the new Space Force headquarters.

While Huntsville has been a hub for missile defense since President Ronald Reagan’s failed ICBM defense efforts, what makes this placement particularly likely is the significance of Huntsville’s Republican representatives in Congress, particularly Congressman Dale Strong. “North Alabama has played a key role in every former and current U.S. missile defense program and will undoubtedly be pivotal to the success of Golden Dome,” he explained, having received $337,600 in campaign contributions from the defense sector during the 2023-2024 election cycle and cofounded the House Golden Dome Caucus.

His advocacy for the project dovetails well with the power vested in House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (also from Alabama), who received $535,000 from the defense sector during the 2024 campaign. Senator Tommy Tuberville, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Katie Boyd Britt, a member of the Senate Golden Dome Caucus, round out Alabama’s Republican Senate delegation.

Many of the leading boosters of the Golden Dome represent states like Alabama or districts that stand to benefit from the program. The bicameral congressional Golden Dome caucuses include numerous members from states already enmeshed in missile production, including North Dakota and Montana, which house ICBMs built and maintained by Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, among other companies.

Those same weapons companies have long been donating generously to political campaigns. And only recently, to curry favor and prove themselves worthy of Golden Dome’s lucrative contracts, Palantir and Booz Allen Hamilton joined Lockheed Martin in donating millions of dollars to President Trump’s new ballroom that is to replace the White House’s devastated East Wing. And expect further public displays of financial affection from arms companies awaiting the administration’s final verdict on Golden Dome contracts, which will likely be announced in early 2026.

The Gold of the Golden Dome

Golden Dome is already slated to receive nearly $40 billion in the next year when funds from President Trump’s “big beautiful bill” and the administration’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2026 are taken into account. The 2026 request for Golden Dome is more than twice the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and three times the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, essential pillars of any effort to prevent new pandemics or address the challenges of the climate crisis. In addition, Golden Dome will undoubtedly siphon into the military sector significant numbers of scientists and engineers who might otherwise be trying to solve environmental and public health problems, undermining this country’s ability to deal with the greatest threats to our lives and livelihoods to fund a defense system that will never actually be able to defend us.

Worse yet, Golden Dome is likely to be more than just a waste of money. It could also accelerate the nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia, and China. If, as is often the case, U.S. adversaries prepare for worst-case scenarios, they are likely to make their plans based on the idea that Golden Dome just might work, which means they’ll increase their offensive forces to ensure that, in a nuclear confrontation, they are able to overwhelm any new missile defense network. It was precisely this sort of offensive/defensive arms race that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of the era of President Richard Nixon was designed to prevent. That agreement was, however, abandoned by President George W. Bush.

A no less dangerous aspect of any future involving the Golden Dome would be the creation of a new set of space-based interceptors as an integral part of the system. An interceptor in space may not actually be able to block a barrage of nuclear warheads, but it would definitely be capable of taking out civilian and military satellites, which travel in predictable orbits. If the unspoken agreement not to attack such satellites were ever to be lifted, basic functions of the global economy (not to speak of the U.S. military) would be at risk. Not only could attacks on satellites bring the global economy to a grinding halt, but they could also spark a spiral of escalation that might, in the end, lead to the use of nuclear weapons.

Should the Golden Dome system indeed be launched (at a staggering cost to the American taxpayer), its “gold” would further enrich already well-heeled weapons contractors, give us a false sense of security, and let Donald Trump pose as this country’s greatest defender ever. Sadly, fantasies die hard, so job number one in rolling back the Golden Dome boondoggle is simply making it clear that no missile defense system will protect us in the event of a nuclear attack, a point made well by A House of Dynamite. The question is: Can our policymakers be as realistic in their assessment of missile defense as the makers of a major Hollywood movie? Or is that simply too much to ask?

Global disaster losses hit $320 billion in 2024, with only $140 billion insured, underlining a stubborn protection gap, especially in emerging markets where coverage is thin.
With $94 trillion in global infrastructure investment needed by 2040 and $15 trillion still unfunded, designing to historical weather means locking in fragile assets that become liabilities as hazards intensify.
Scaling to the $8.9 trillion global power sector suggests around $23 billion in cumulative avoided losses over two decades.
“By embedding risk analytics across sovereign, multilateral and private investment systems, resilience can move from being underfunded and undervalued to being investable at scale,” Ms. Bharadwaj said, calling for systemic reforms under the Baku-Belém Roadmap.","A new International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) paper released at COP30 said that India’s clean‑energy surge, from 18 GW in 2010 to over 190 GW by September 2025, shows how smart policy can mobilise private capital, and sets out how the same approach can mainstream risk analytics to unlock $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for adaptation and resilience under the Baku-Belém Roadmap.

Authored by Ritu Bharadwaj, director of climate resilience, finance, loss and damage at IIED, and N. Karthikeyan, a development economist, the paper contends that “resilience can be transformed from a perceived cost into an investable asset if risk analytics are embedded across sovereign finance, development bank operations and private portfolios.”

The report is part of IIED’s COP30 publications and has been showcased at side events in Belém focused on resilience finance, debt sustainability and risk‑informed infrastructure. “India’s experience shows that clear policy signals and de-risking tools can mobilise private investment at scale, the same approach can work for resilience,” Mr. Karthikeyan said.

Global disaster losses hit $320 billion in 2024, with only $140 billion insured, underlining a stubborn protection gap, especially in emerging markets where coverage is thin. Swiss Re’s 2023 sigma confirms only about 38–40% of catastrophe losses were insured globally, and that insured losses exceeding $100 billion per year are now “the norm,” the paper said.

The paper traces a vicious cycle: climate disasters widen fiscal deficits and force new borrowing; that contributes to credit downgrades and higher spreads, shrinking fiscal space for prevention and resilience in the next shock. Using a synthetic control method, the authors show Grenada’s rating plunged after Hurricane Ivan while a “no‑disaster” counterfactual stayed stable; Belize and Papua New Guinea show similar patterns. By contrast, Fiji’s preparedness helped its rating track at or above the synthetic control after Cyclone Winston, evidence that prevention preserves credit, Ms. Bharadwaj explained.

Beyond debt and ratings, climate shocks hit the exchange rate. The paper’s regression suggests that a one‑unit rise in climate vulnerability can raise exchange‑rate pressure by approximately 65%; in 2022 alone, average exchange‑related losses reached about $2.4 billion in SIDS and $11.6 billion in LDCs, with cumulative losses since 1991 at $27 billion and $68 billion respectively, money that could otherwise build resilience.

With $94 trillion in global infrastructure investment needed by 2040 and $15 trillion still unfunded, designing to historical weather means locking in fragile assets that become liabilities as hazards intensify. The paper calls for probabilistic, multi‑hazard assessment that captures tail‑risk and cascading impacts across systems, far beyond static maps or qualitative screens.

Insurers’ catastrophe (CAT) models and risk engineering simulate thousands of events by combining hazard probabilities, asset exposure and vulnerability functions to generate loss curves and quantify avoided losses from specific measures. Because these tools already underpin underwriting and solvency, their outputs carry credibility with investors and rating agencies, and can be priced into loans, bonds and portfolios.

In five anonymised power‑plant case studies across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Pacific and Latin America, annual expected losses (AEL) fell from $48.6 million to $9.8 million with resilience upgrades, approximately $10 billion avoided over 20 years; extreme‑event losses dropped by about $177 million per year. Scaling to the $8.9 trillion global power sector suggests around $23 billion in cumulative avoided losses over two decades.

AUDI’s flood safeguards in Germany kept production running in 2021 (the paper does not quantify exact savings), while Chennai’s 2015 floods caused ₹ 1,500 crore (approximately $225 million) in downtime; Madrid’s heat strategy contrasts with Paris 2003 (735 deaths; €13.2 billion losses).

India also appears in an eight‑country comparison with Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Pakistan, Senegal, Uganda. Under a 1‑in‑20‑year shock, 5% loss‑exceedance probability, losses total $21.4 billion; covering them reactively via humanitarian or social protection would cost approximately $93 billion, while early resilience investments deliver equivalent protection for about $4.1 billion, around 80% cheaper. The return on investment across contexts is greater than $5 avoided losses per $1 invested.

“By embedding risk analytics across sovereign, multilateral and private investment systems, resilience can move from being underfunded and undervalued to being investable at scale,” Ms. Bharadwaj said, calling for systemic reforms under the Baku-Belém Roadmap.",https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,N,,2025-11-16 23:59:18.250377

Governor Greg Abbott joined the announcement on Thursday in Midlothian, highlighting the initiative's economic and technological impact.

The plan includes three new data centre campuses to support Google's growing cloud and artificial intelligence operations. These energy-intensive facilities will be paired with programmes to strengthen Texas' grid, improve energy affordability, and provide workforce training for students, apprentices, and skilled workers.

“This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state … Texas is the epicentre of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy… We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen,” Abbott said.

Pichai added, “They say that everything is bigger in Texas – and that certainly applies to the golden opportunity with AI… This investment will create thousands of jobs, provide skills training to college students and electrical apprentices, and accelerate energy affordability initiatives throughout Texas.” Texas has become a hub for major tech and energy companies. Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, along with Amazon and Meta data centres, have made the state a magnet for high-tech manufacturing and cloud infrastructure.

Experts say Google's expansion reinforces Texas' position as a business-friendly state with abundant energy and a skilled workforce.

The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.
United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.
Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.
“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said.","BELEM, Brazil — Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren’t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action - on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more - including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad as it could be.”

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

Repurposing and recycling EV batteries is important because the metals and minerals that go into them, like nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese, require invasive mining.

These resources are also often located in regions that have ongoing human rights issues, like Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, per the BBC. Recycling these materials means less mining could be required, cutting down on the negative human and environmental impacts.

For the average driver, improved recycling for EV batteries will help with long-term costs, making new batteries more affordable. It also prevents them from ending up in landfills, where they can release harmful pollutants into the water, air, and soil.

The United States — the world’s biggest economy, top oil and gas producer and second-largest climate polluter — is pursuing a fossil fuel renaissance while forsaking plans to shift toward renewables.
The developed world is continuing to move in the wrong direction on fossil fuels, climate activists say.
“We know that the world’s richest countries are continuing to invest in oil and gas development,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist who founded Climate Analytics, a policy group.
At last year’s climate talks in Azerbaijan, they upped the ante to $300 billion per year by 2035.","Days after the gathering started last week, nations were still sorting out what to do with contentious issues that have typically held up the annual negotiations. As the talks opened, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the world must “fight” efforts to deny the reality of climate change — decades after scientists concluded that people are making the Earth hotter.

That led one official to offer a grim assessment of global efforts to tackle climate change, 10 years after an earlier summit produced the sweeping Paris Agreement.

“We have miserably failed to accomplish the objective of this convention, which is the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama’s climate envoy and lead negotiator, during an interview at the conference site in Belém, Brazil.

“Additional promises mean nothing if you didn’t achieve or fulfill your previous promises,” he added.

It hasn’t helped that the U.S. is skipping the summit for the first time, or that President Donald Trump dismisses climate change as a hoax and urged the world to abandon efforts to fix it. But Trump isn’t the only reason for stalled action. Economic uncertainty, infighting and political backsliding have stymied green measures in both North America and Europe.

In other parts of the world, countries are embracing the economic opportunities that the green transition offers. Many officials in Belém point to signs that progress is underway, including the rapid growth of renewables and electric vehicles and a broader understanding of both the world’s challenges and the means to address them.

“Now we talk about solar panels, electric cars, regenerative agriculture, stopping deforestation, as if we have always talked about those things,” said Ana Toni, the summit’s executive director. “Just in one decade, the topic changed totally. But we still need to speed up the process.”

Still, analysts say it’s become inevitable that the world’s warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius since the dawn of the industrial era, breaching the target at the heart of the Paris Agreement. With that in mind, countries are huddling at this month’s summit, known as COP30, with the hope of finding greater alignment on how to slow rising temperatures.

But how credible would any promises reached in Brazil be? Here are five pledges achieved at past climate summits — and where they stand now:

Moving away from fossil fuels

The historic 2023 agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels, made at the COP28 talks in Dubai, was the first time that nearly 200 countries agreed to wind down their use of oil, natural gas and coal. Though nonbinding, that commitment was even more striking because the talks were overseen by the chief executive of the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company.

Just two years later, fossil fuel consumption is on the rise, despite rapid growth of wind and solar, and many of the world’s largest oil and gas producers plan to drill even more. The United States — the world’s biggest economy, top oil and gas producer and second-largest climate polluter — is pursuing a fossil fuel renaissance while forsaking plans to shift toward renewables.

The president of the Dubai summit, Sultan al-Jaber, said at a recent energy conference that while wind and solar would expand, so too would oil and gas, in part to meet soaring demand for data centers. Liquefied natural gas would grow 65 percent by 2050, and oil will continue to be used as a feedstock for plastic, he said.

“The exponential growth of AI is also creating a power surge that no one anticipated 18 months ago,” he said in a press release from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., where he remains managing director and group CEO.

The developed world is continuing to move in the wrong direction on fossil fuels, climate activists say.

“We know that the world’s richest countries are continuing to invest in oil and gas development,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist who founded Climate Analytics, a policy group. “This simply should not be happening.”

The Paris-based International Energy Agency said last week that oil and gas demand could grow for decades to come. That statement marked a reversal from the group’s previous forecast that oil use would peak in 2030 as clean energy takes hold. Trump’s policies are one reason for the pivot.

Still, renewables such as wind and solar power are soaring in many countries, leading analysts to believe that nations will continue to shift away from fossil fuels. How quickly that will happen is unknown.

“The transition is underway but not yet at the pace or scale required,” said a U.N. report on global climate action released last week. It pointed to large gaps in efforts to reduce fossil fuel subsidies and abate methane pollution.

Lula opened this year’s climate conference by calling for a “road map” to cut fossil fuels globally. It has earned support from countries such as Colombia, Germany, Kenya and the United Kingdom. But it’s not part of the official agenda at these talks, and many poorer countries say what they really need is funding and support to make the shift.

Triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency

This call also emerged from the 2023 summit, and was considered a tangible measure of countries’ progress toward achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets.

Countries are on track to meet the pledge to triple their renewable energy capacity by 2030, thanks largely to a record surge in solar power, according to energy think tank Ember.

It estimates that the world is set to add around 793 gigawatts of new renewable capacity in 2025, up from 717 gigawatts in 2024, driven mainly by China.

“If this pace continues, annual additions now only need to grow by around 12 percent a year from 2026 to 2030 to reach tripling, compared with 21 percent originally needed,” said Dave Jones, Ember’s chief analyst. “But governments will need to strengthen commitments to lock this in.”

The pledge to double the world’s energy efficiency by 2030, by contrast, is a long way behind. While efficiency improvements would need to grow by 4 percent a year to reach that target, they hit only 1 percent in 2024.

‘Loss and damage’ fund

When the landmark fund for victims of climate disasters was established at the 2022 talks in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, it offered promise that billions of dollars would someday flow to nations slammed by hurricanes, droughts or rising seas.

Three years later, it has less than $800 million — only a little more than it had in 2023.

Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, excoriated leaders this month for not providing more. Her rebuke came little more than a week after Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever seen in the Atlantic, swept across the Caribbean.

“All of us should hold our heads down in shame, because having established this fund a few years ago in Sharm El-Sheikh, its capital base is still under $800 million while Jamaica reels from damage in excess of $7 billion, not to mention Cuba or the Bahamas,” she said.

Last week, the fund announced it was allocating $250 million for financial requests to help less-wealthy nations grapple with “damage from slow onset and extreme climate-induced events.” The fund’s executive director, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, said the call for contributions was significant but also a reminder that the fund needs much more money.

Richard Muyungi, chair for the African Group of Negotiators and Tanzania’s climate envoy, said he expects additional funds will come from this summit, though not the billions needed.

“There is a chance that the fund will run out of money by next year, year after next, before it even is given a chance to replenish itself,” said Michai Robertson, a senior finance adviser for the Alliance of Small Island States.

Global Methane Pledge

Backed by the U.S. and European Union, this pledge to cut global methane emissions 30 percent by 2030 was launched four years ago at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, sparking a wave of talk about the benefits of cutting methane, a greenhouse gas with a relatively short shelf life but much greater warming potential than carbon dioxide.

“The Global Methane Pledge has been instrumental in catalyzing attention to the issue of methane, because it has moved from a niche issue to one of the critical elements of the climate planning discussions,” said Giulia Ferrini, head of the U.N. Environment Program’s International Methane Emissions Observatory.

“All the tools are there,” she added. “It’s just a question of political will.”

Methane emissions from the oil and gas sector remain stubbornly high, despite the economic benefits of bringing them down, according to the IEA. The group’s latest methane tracker shows that energy-based methane pollution was around 120 million tons in 2024, roughly the same as a year earlier.

Despite more than 150 nations joining the Global Methane Pledge, few countries or companies have devised plans to meet their commitments, “and even fewer have demonstrated verifiable emissions reductions,” the IEA said.

The European Union’s methane regulation requires all oil and gas operators to measure, report and verify their emissions, including importers. And countries and companies are becoming more diligent about complying with an international satellite program that notifies companies and countries of methane leaks so they can repair them. Responses went from just 1 percent of alerts last year to 12 percent so far in 2025.

More work is needed to achieve the 2030 goal, the U.N. says. Meanwhile, U.S. officials have pressured the EU to rethink its methane curbs.

Barbados and several other countries are calling for a binding methane pact similar to the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 agreement that’s widely credited with saving the ozone layer by phasing out the use of harmful pollutants.

That’s something Paris Agreement architect Laurence Tubiana hopes could happen.

“I’m just in favor of tackling this very seriously, because the pledge doesn’t work [well] enough,” she said.

Climate finance

In 2009, wealthy countries agreed to provide $100 billion annually until 2025 to help poorer nations deal with rising temperatures. At last year’s climate talks in Azerbaijan, they upped the ante to $300 billion per year by 2035.

But those countries delivered the $100 billion two years late, and many nations viewed the new $300 billion commitment with disappointment. India, which expressed particular ire about last year’s outcome, is pushing for new discussions in Brazil to get that money flowing.

“Finance really is at the core of everything that we do,” Ali Mohamed, Kenya’s climate envoy, told POLITICO’s E&E News. But he also recognizes that governments alone are not the answer. “We cannot say finance must only come from the public sector.”

Last year’s pledge included a call for companies and multilateral development banks to contribute a sum exceeding $1 trillion by 2035, but much of that would be juiced by donor nations — and more countries would need to contribute.

That is more important now, said Jake Werksman, the EU’s lead negotiator.

“As you know, one of the larger contributors to this process, the U.S., has essentially shut down all development flows from the U.S. budget, and no other party, including the EU, can make up for that gap,” he said during a press conference.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5b%2Fed%2Fc5e2173d4eabb3f1f32786d47230%2Fclimate-cop30-92558.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:38.103452

Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.

Much of the discussion is about data centers, which are often large developments used to support cloud computing or artificial intelligence. But the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.

“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”

I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.

Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.

Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.

It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.

Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.

Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.

He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”

He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.

Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.

“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.

The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.

Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.

“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.

Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.

But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.

From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.

Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohioapproved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.

Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is“disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.

In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocatejointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

IEA Report Points to Oil Peak and Continuing Renewables Surge, But Trump Has Hurt Progress: The world remains on track to reach peak oil in about 2030 if countries stick to their stated policies, according to the new edition of the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency. But this outlook is worse for the climate than the one issued last year, due in large part to changes in climate policy by President Donald Trump, as my colleague Blanca Begert reports. One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.

Regulatory and Infrastructure Challenges Despite the proven success at Redwood Coast Airport, V2G faces significant barriers to widespread adoption.
That’s the vision V2G proponents have been describing for years, and projects like Redwood Coast Airport are making it real.
The missing piece is widespread deployment—and that’s exactly what projects like Redwood Coast Airport are helping to enable.","A groundbreaking vehicle-to-grid project at California’s Redwood Coast Airport is demonstrating how electric vehicles can serve as more than just transportation—they’re becoming mobile power plants that strengthen grid resilience and reduce costs.

PG&E, Nissan, Fermata Energy, and the Schatz Energy Research Center at Cal Poly Humboldt have successfully integrated two previous-generation Nissan Leaf electric vehicles into the airport’s existing microgrid infrastructure in McKinleyville, California, reports ARS Technica. The 2020 and 2021 Leaf models, equipped with CHAdeMO quick charge ports, connect to four bidirectional FE-20 charging stations that can both charge the vehicles and draw power from their batteries.

How the V2G System Works

The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid, which has been operating since 2021, already features a 2.2 MW solar array and 8.9 MWh of battery storage, along with a 300 kW net-metered solar system. The two-vehicle Nissan Leaf fleet adds another layer of flexibility and capacity to this sophisticated energy system.

When county staff aren’t using the Leafs for work activities, the vehicles plug into Fermata Energy’s FE-20 bidirectional chargers. These specialized units can charge at 20 kW and discharge at the same rate, transforming the EVs into distributed energy resources. The system uses Fermata’s intelligent V2X platform to optimize when to charge, discharge, or hold battery capacity based on grid conditions and electricity prices.

“Integrating bidirectional chargers and EVs at the Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid is an innovative solution that will expand the capacity of the site, extending the capability for powering the airport during local grid outages and providing another clean energy resource for ensuring statewide grid stability,” said Mike Delaney, Vice President of Utility Partnerships and Innovation at PG&E.

Real-World Performance and Revenue Generation

The vehicles serve multiple purposes beyond basic transportation. During normal operations, they participate in California’s Emergency Load Reduction Program, generating revenue for Humboldt County by responding to grid stress events. When electricity prices are high during peak demand periods, the system can draw power from the parked EVs’ batteries, helping to reduce the county’s utility bills through strategic energy management.

When the microgrid operates in “island mode”—disconnected from the main grid during outages—the Nissan Leafs respond to changes in grid frequency, either injecting power when needed or absorbing excess solar energy depending on their battery levels. This automatic frequency response is crucial for maintaining stable power delivery to the airport and adjacent U.S. Coast Guard Air Station.

The Coast Guard facility oversees search and rescue operations for 250 miles of rural coastline, from the Mendocino-Sonoma county line to the California-Oregon border. Since roads into Humboldt County are frequently closed by fires and landslides, maintaining airport operations during emergencies is literally a matter of life and death.

Battle-Tested Technology

The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid has already proven its worth under extreme conditions. On December 20, 2022, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake knocked out power to more than 70,000 electric customers in Humboldt County. The microgrid automatically disconnected from the grid and provided power to the airport and Coast Guard station for nearly 15 hours—despite facing worst-case conditions.

The earthquake struck at the winter solstice after the batteries had discharged during evening peak demand, leaving them at their lowest charge level. Weather conditions were overcast and rainy, limiting solar generation. Despite these challenges, the system performed flawlessly, allowing the Coast Guard to conduct rescue operations while most of the county remained in the dark.

Since then, the microgrid has been called into service multiple times during winter storm outages, sometimes running for less than 30 minutes and other times operating for eight hours or more. The addition of the bidirectional EV charging capability further enhances this proven resilience.

Industry Leadership in V2G Technology

The FE-20 bidirectional chargers represent the latest generation of Fermata Energy’s technology. The predecessor FE-15 model helped reduce electricity bills by more than $9,450 over four years at Nissan’s Americas Headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee—averaging nearly $2,000 in annual savings. The enhanced FE-20 is expected to deliver even better performance.

“At Fermata Energy, we see a real opportunity to transform electric vehicles from simple modes of transportation into critical energy assets,” said Hamza Lemsaddek, Chief Operating Officer of Fermata Energy. “By integrating our intelligent V2X platform and bidirectional chargers, we are delivering measurable cost savings, valuable grid services and enhanced local energy resilience.”

Nissan has been a pioneer in bidirectional charging capability. The Leaf became the first fully bidirectional-capable electric vehicle launched in the U.S. when it debuted with CHAdeMO V2G capability in 2013. All Nissan Leaf vehicles from model year 2013 and later are compatible with bidirectional charging, though the infrastructure to support V2G has been slow to develop.

There are currently over 30 proven V2G installations across the United States using Fermata Energy chargers and Nissan Leaf vehicles, aimed at helping fleets and dealerships optimize energy usage and reduce costs.

Technical Innovation and Future Implications

The Redwood Coast Airport project is jointly operated by PG&E and the Redwood Coast Energy Authority, Humboldt County’s local Community Choice Aggregator. The collaboration required developing new operating agreements and tariff structures that have informed PG&E’s Community Microgrid Enablement Program—a framework that could serve as a blueprint for similar projects across California and beyond.

“We are proud to have led the technical integration of this important pilot project that advances local resiliency and deep decarbonization and can play an important role in the community microgrids that are being developed across California’s rural north coast and beyond,” said David Carter, principal engineer at the Schatz Energy Research Center at Cal Poly Humboldt.

The project demonstrates that V2G technology is not just a concept for the future—it’s operational today and providing tangible benefits. The system shows how older EV models can contribute to grid stability and energy resilience, extending their utility beyond personal transportation.

For Humboldt County, the technology offers multiple advantages: reduced electricity costs, backup power during emergencies, participation in grid services that generate revenue, and enhanced community resilience. The county staff can use the vehicles normally for work activities, then plug them in to serve as energy assets when parked.

The CHAdeMO Advantage and Limitation

The project relies on CHAdeMO, the Japanese DC fast charging standard that includes native V2G capability in its protocol specification. While CHAdeMO has become less common as CCS (Combined Charging System) has gained market dominance in North America and Europe, it remains the only charging standard with widespread bidirectional capability deployed in production vehicles.

This presents both an opportunity and a challenge. On one hand, hundreds of thousands of Nissan Leafs on the road today (model year 2013 and later) could theoretically participate in V2G programs with the right infrastructure. On the other hand, most new EVs are moving to CCS connectors, which will require updated standards and vehicle hardware to enable widespread bidirectional charging.

The Nissan Leaf, despite being an older design that has been surpassed by newer EVs in range and features, continues to hold unique value precisely because of its bidirectional charging capability. As battery costs continue to fall and EV adoption accelerates, the ability to use parked vehicles as distributed energy storage could become increasingly valuable for grid management.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

The V2G integration at Redwood Coast Airport offers a glimpse into a possible future where millions of electric vehicles contribute to grid stability and renewable energy integration. During the day, excess solar power can charge vehicle batteries. In the evening, when solar generation drops but electricity demand peaks, those same batteries can discharge to meet demand—reducing reliance on fossil fuel “peaker” plants that utilities typically fire up during high-demand periods.

This time-shifting of renewable energy helps address one of the key challenges of solar power: its generation doesn’t always align with when people need electricity. Battery storage solves this problem, and parked EVs represent an enormous potential storage resource. With an average EV battery capacity of 60-100 kWh, even a small fleet can provide meaningful energy storage capacity.

The economic model is compelling. Humboldt County receives both transportation vehicles and energy storage capacity from the same assets. During grid stress events, they earn revenue by participating in demand response programs. They save money through strategic charging and discharging based on time-of-use electricity rates. And they gain energy resilience that has already proven lifesaving during natural disasters.

Regulatory and Infrastructure Challenges

Despite the proven success at Redwood Coast Airport, V2G faces significant barriers to widespread adoption. Utility interconnection processes can be complicated and time-consuming. Building codes and local regulations often weren’t written with bidirectional charging in mind. Insurance and liability questions remain partially unresolved.

Most significantly, automakers have been slow to embrace bidirectional charging beyond Nissan. Ford’s F-150 Lightning offers vehicle-to-home capability but requires proprietary equipment. GM has announced plans for V2G capability but hasn’t delivered production systems yet. Tesla, despite early promises, has yet to enable bidirectional charging in any of its vehicles.

The charging infrastructure also needs to expand dramatically. While unidirectional DC fast chargers are becoming more common, bidirectional chargers remain rare and expensive. Standardization efforts are underway, but the industry hasn’t yet coalesced around a single approach for CCS-based V2G systems.

California’s regulatory environment, however, provides some advantages. The state has been progressive in creating programs and tariff structures that allow V2G participation. The California Public Utilities Commission has explored various mechanisms to compensate EV owners for providing grid services. And programs like the Emergency Load Reduction Program create revenue opportunities for V2G participants.

What This Means for the Future

The Redwood Coast Airport project serves as a proof of concept that could inform much larger deployments. If the model can work for two Nissan Leafs at a rural airport, it could potentially scale to fleet vehicles at businesses, school buses, delivery vans, or even residential EVs.

Imagine a future where your parked EV at home helps stabilize the local grid, earns you a few dollars per month, and serves as backup power during outages—all while remaining fully charged and ready to drive whenever you need it. That’s the vision V2G proponents have been describing for years, and projects like Redwood Coast Airport are making it real.

For California, which has aggressive renewable energy and EV adoption targets, V2G technology could prove essential for grid management. As more solar and wind power comes online, and as millions of EVs start charging regularly, the grid will need flexible resources that can balance supply and demand. Parked EVs could fill that role, turning a potential grid challenge into a solution.

The technology is proven. The economics are increasingly favorable. The regulatory frameworks are developing. The missing piece is widespread deployment—and that’s exactly what projects like Redwood Coast Airport are helping to enable.

EVXL’s Take

The Redwood Coast Airport V2G project represents exactly the kind of practical innovation that could accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation and energy systems. While we’ve covered Nissan’s involvement in V2G initiatives before—including when they joined ChargeScape as an equal investor alongside BMW, Ford, and Honda in October 2024—seeing the technology deployed at critical infrastructure like an airport demonstrates its real-world viability.

The timing of this project is particularly noteworthy given the challenges facing EV adoption and grid infrastructure. With concerns about grid capacity to handle widespread EV charging, bidirectional technology flips the script: EVs become part of the solution rather than just another demand on the system. The fact that this is working with older Nissan Leaf models rather than cutting-edge new vehicles also sends an important message about the value proposition of existing EV fleets.

What’s especially compelling about the Redwood Coast implementation is its performance during the December 2022 earthquake. When 70,000 customers lost power, this system kept the airport and Coast Guard station operational under worst-case conditions—low battery charge, minimal solar generation, and winter weather. That’s not a lab demonstration or theoretical model; it’s proven resilience when lives were on the line.

The broader implications for EVXL readers are significant. As automakers continue to introduce more EVs with bidirectional capability, and as companies like ChargeScape build out the platform infrastructure to manage V2G systems, we’re likely to see much wider deployment of this technology. In fact, ChargeScape is already enabling EV owners to earn money while they sleep through smart charging programs—with some drivers potentially earning up to $3,000 per year through bidirectional power-sharing.

Fleet operators, in particular, should be paying close attention—school buses, delivery vehicles, and other fleets that sit parked for significant portions of the day could generate additional revenue and provide community benefits through V2G participation.

The CHAdeMO limitation is worth noting. As the industry moves toward CCS connectors, the bidirectional capabilities that make Nissan Leafs valuable for V2G will need to be replicated in the new standard. The good news is that work is underway, with multiple automakers committing to bidirectional charging in future models. But for now, those older Leafs—often dismissed as outdated compared to newer EVs with longer range—offer a capability that most modern EVs can’t match.

California’s regulatory leadership continues to be crucial. The state’s willingness to develop new tariff structures, operating agreements, and compensation mechanisms for V2G participants creates a model that other jurisdictions can follow. PG&E’s Community Microgrid Enablement Program, informed by projects like this one, could standardize the process for integrating V2G into utility operations.

For the EV industry, the message is clear: vehicles are becoming more than just transportation. They’re mobile energy storage units that can provide grid services, backup power, and revenue opportunities. This adds another dimension to the total cost of ownership calculations that potential EV buyers consider. A vehicle that can reduce your electricity bills, power your home during outages, and earn money when parked offers value beyond its driving capabilities.

We’ll be watching closely as ChargeScape and similar platforms work to scale this technology beyond pilot projects. The Redwood Coast Airport demonstration proves the technology works; now the challenge is making it accessible to millions of EV owners rather than just specialized fleet applications. If successful, V2G could become one of those infrastructure innovations that seems obvious in retrospect—of course our parked vehicles should be helping to stabilize the grid and integrate renewable energy. The only question is how quickly we can make that vision a reality.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_0102.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:29.725986

Good Sunday afternoon. Garrett Ross here. With the Commanders drawing the early time slot today in the latest installment of the NFL’s expanded international slate, it does make me wonder whether there’s something to be said for knowing your team’s result one way or another by lunchtime, so that you can get on with your day. Let me know your thoughts.

DRIVING THE DAY

ON MESSAGE: If you’re trying to deliver a message directly to President Donald Trump, the best arena might just be an interview on Fox News.

So one might imagine, as one of the biggest intraparty blowups among Republicans unravels, that the subject of Trump’s ire would appear on the airwaves of Fox News.

But Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene — once among the president’s staunchest defenders in Congress and now a subject of Trump’s scorn following her push to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — was on her own messaging mission this morning. Though her comments centered on the president, he didn’t appear to be her primary audience: Greene gave her first TV interview since the public spat with Trump to Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” — perhaps an unintentionally well-named venue for the swirling saga that is set to dominate headlines for at least a few more days.

So what was the reason for the split? “Unfortunately, it has all come down to the Epstein files, and that is shocking,” Greene told Bash, underscoring her belief that the country “deserves transparency” with regard to the files and vowing to continue pushing for their full release.

Greene said she still supports Trump and the majority of his agenda — but cracks continue to emerge, with the Georgia Republican maintaining that Trump should focus on cost-of-living issues more and cut back on foreign affairs. And she acknowledged that Trump’s comments this week have been “hurtful.”

“The most hurtful thing he said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a ‘traitor.’ And that is so extremely wrong. And those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” Greene said.

Pressed by Bash, she acknowledged it was “fair criticism” to say that she has stayed silent on other occasions when Trump has attacked political opponents.

“I am committed, and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” Greene said, noting that she’s wanted to move away from “toxic politics” since the killing of Charlie Kirk. “I’m leading the way with my own example. And I hope that President Trump can do the same.”

While Greene may be undergoing some changes, others in her party are following familiar patterns. One person who did make an appearance over on “Fox News Sunday” this morning was Speaker Mike Johnson. With the House set to vote on the release of the Epstein files on Tuesday, Johnson waved off the idea that Trump is sweating it.

“He’s not worried about it. I talk to him all the time. He has nothing to do with this,” Johnson said. “He’s frustrated that they are turning him into a political issue, and it’s not surprising because the Democrats have nothing else to talk about.”

But it’s not just Democrats talking about the Epstein files.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who teamed up with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to deliver the discharge petition that forced the House vote this week, was on ABC’s “This Week” to tout his efforts.

“Dogs don’t bark at parked cars, and we are winning,” Massie said.

“I am not tired of winning yet,” he said, likely a cheeky nod to a Trumpian phrase, “but we are winning. And not only the speaker, but the attorney general, the FBI director and the president himself and the vice president, they are taking a big loss this week because after months of fighting I am winning this week with Ro Khanna. We are forcing this vote and it will happen.”

As for the vote itself, he predicted a “deluge” of Republicans will join in voting for the release of the files — but his aim is much higher.

“I hope we get a veto-proof majority on this legislation,” Massie said, noting that the path forward in the Senate is far from clear.

“I just hope John Thune will do the right thing,” Massie said of the Senate majority leader. “But the pressure is going to be there if we get a big vote in the House.”

And he’s got a message for his colleagues who are still deciding how they’ll vote come Tuesday.

“Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement. But in 2030, he’s not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles if you don’t vote to release these files,” he warned. “And the president can’t protect you then. This vote — the record of this vote — will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency.”

SUNDAY BEST …

— Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on the coming HHS advisory vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants, on CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “I’m very concerned about this. … The vaccine is safe … and these ingredients they’re speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don’t understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we’ve been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I’m a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. … I want to make America healthy, and you don’t start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.”

— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on U.S.-China trade talks, on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures”: “We haven’t even finished the agreement, which we hope to have done by Thanksgiving, and I am confident that post-our meeting in Korea between the two leaders — President Trump, President Xi [Jinping] — that China will honor their agreements.”

— National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on the cost of coffee, bananas, beef and other goods after tariffs are removed, on ABC’s “This Week”: “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs, so —” Jonathan Karl: “So they might not come down.” Hassett: “And so the prices will go down, of course.” Karl: “Because the tariffs have been taken off, right?” Hassett: “Right, well because the supply of goods into the U.S. is going to increase.”

— Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave his quiet blessing for Kaine to vote to end the shutdown, on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “Absolutely not. … He would have preferred that I not voted the way that I did. But he knows that U.S. senators are going to do what’s in the interest of their constituents. And my 320,000 federal workers and their families are a powerful, powerful part of who I represent. And when I could get important protections for them after a year of being kicked around by Donald Trump, I said, ‘I’m ready to sign on.’ … Some folks like [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] may think that’s nothing. Virginians think it’s an awful lot.”

— Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on GOP changes to Obamacare, on “Fox News Sunday”: “We’re not going to repeal Obamacare. We’re going to fix Obamacare … You do have to protect pre-existing conditions, you have to make sure that it’s a fair system to everybody. So this is all doable. There’s no reason health care costs what it costs. We should not give money directly to the insurance companies.”

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. THE CRACKDOWN: The federal immigration crackdown has arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina. In Trump’s latest urban target — which has seen huge recent population growth from Latin American immigrants — masked Border Patrol agents commenced operations yesterday and into today, arresting people in sometimes violent encounters and triggering protests, as the Charlotte Observer reports. In one high-profile incident, agents smashed through the window of a U.S. citizen’s truck. Immigrant advocates condemned the dozens of arrests already, while Border Patrol leader Gregory Bovino celebrated “a record day today!!!!!”

The fallout unfolded similarly to the previous crackdowns in LA and Chicago: Businesses closed and streets emptied out in areas with large immigrant populations. Democratic and Republican elected officials feuded over the crackdown. It’s not clear how long Border Patrol’s operations in the city, dubbed “Charlotte’s Web,” will last. Republicans have targeted crime in Charlotte since the random killing of a woman on a train in August.

Up next: After Charlotte, Border Patrol plans to take on New Orleans as its next target, as CBS’ Camilo Montoya-Galvez scooped. That operation will be called “Catahoula Crunch.”

Standing down: Some 400 federalized National Guard troops who were sent to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago from out of state are heading back home, after court fights prevented them from ever deploying on the streets, ABC’s Luis Martinez reports. Though the troops from California and Texas are leaving, 200 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in Chicago, as will half of the 200 Oregon National Guard troops in Portland.

2. BIG INVESTIGATION: “The Department of Deportation,” by NYT’s Nicholas Nehamas and colleagues: “The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from President Trump … A national security probe into the black market for Iranian oil sold to finance terrorism has been slowed down for months because of the shift to immigration work, allowing tanker ships and money to disappear. And federal efforts to combat human smuggling and sex trafficking have languished …

“Homeland security investigators worked approximately 33 percent fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February through April compared to their average in prior years … Administration officials defended Mr. Trump’s approach, saying the immigration crackdown was paramount to protecting public safety and national security. They also disputed that the intensified focus on immigration had undermined D.H.S.’s work. … Roughly 8 percent of those arrested had been convicted of a violent crime.”

3. THE SUBSIDIES: If Congress ends up extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies but makes policy changes to secure Republican votes, the 20 state Obamacare exchanges would have to race to update their systems accordingly, POLITICO’s Robert King reports. Implementing a clean extension would be pretty feasible, but big changes could take the state exchanges a lot of time to update premiums and communicate to consumers.

The politics: As Democrats increasingly focus on health care ahead of the midterms, some believe they can win over voters by decrying HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine views and actions, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. And they’ll seek to win over a public facing the largest contraction of the social safety net in decades. Even as SNAP comes back online following the government shutdown, Republicans’ cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are expected to force millions of people off food stamps in the next few months, along with Medicaid cuts and other changes, POLITICO’s Marcia Brown notes.

Annals of influence: Health insurance companies faced off with Trump to try to secure the subsidy extensions. Pharmaceutical companies tried to win him over and strike deals to forestall tariffs. The divergent outcomes — with pharma so far coming out ahead — were “a case study for lobbyists trying to figure out how to handle the mercurial president and his populist approach to politics,” POLITICO’s Amanda Chu reports. “Currying favor helps, fighting is risky business.”

4. SURVEY SAYS: Americans agree that Republicans won the government shutdown, saying by a margin of 55 percent to 6 percent that the GOP got more of what they wanted, according to a new CBS poll. Relatedly, Republicans are largely satisfied with their leaders’ level of compromise, while a majority of Democrats think their party gave in too much. But the standoff did raise the salience of health care: Nearly two-thirds of the country expects that health insurance premiums are going up in the months to come.

5. STAT OF THE DAY: “Trump buys at least $82 million in bonds since late August, disclosures show,” by Reuters’ Nandita Bose: “According to the forms released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Trump carried out more than 175 financial purchases … Most of the assets listed in Saturday’s disclosures consist of bonds issued by municipalities, states, counties, school districts and other entities with ties to public agencies. Trump’s new bond investments span several industries, including sectors that have already benefited, or are benefiting, from his administration’s policy changes … The administration has said before that … neither he nor his family has a role in running the portfolio.”

6. PARDON ME: Ed Martin announced that Trump has pardoned two more people for crimes that arose from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, per NYT’s Alan Feuer. One, Daniel Wilson, had been convicted for having illegal weapons and ammunition discovered as part of an investigation into his separate Jan. 6 crimes. The other, Suzanne Kaye, was sentenced for threatening FBI agents with violence. The pardons “were part of Mr. Trump’s continuing efforts to rewrite the history of Jan. 6,” the Times writes.

7. MAKING A LIST: “Trump recasts foreign terror list to focus on ‘antifa,’ cartels,” by WaPo’s Adam Taylor: “The Trump administration is pursuing an unprecedented expansion of the U.S. government’s list of foreign terrorist organizations, adding left-wing groups in Europe along with Latin American drug-trafficking organizations … [E]xperts said the targeting of groups linked to antifa … was a highly unusual move, particularly as those targeted this week do not directly threaten the United States or have a record of committing deadly attacks.”

8. MYSTERY SOLVED? Newly released financial disclosures show that Adriana Kugler’s surprise departure from the Fed in August came as she was being investigated for breaking ethics rules, per Bloomberg. Kugler had traded individual stocks, against Fed rules. The central bank’s IG is still investigating. Kugler had asked for a waiver and been denied by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the documents reveal. She declined to comment.

9. AN UNORTHODOX CANDIDATE: “Bravo star Dr. Heavenly Kimes wins reality TV fights. Can she win a run for Congress?” by USA Today’s Jay Stahl: “Cosmetic dentist Dr. Heavenly Kimes has been throwing shade with a smile for over a decade on Bravo’s ‘Married to Medicine’ … Now, Kimes, 54, is running in a crowded Democratic primary as she seeks to unseat Rep. David Scott, the 80-year-old incumbent in Georgia’s 13th congressional district … Kimes was demoted from main cast member and has less airtime this season – a move some believe Bravo made due to her congressional hopes – but she was allowed to film while running for office.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

Nicolás Maduro sang “Imagine” at a rally against Donald Trump’s pressure campaign.

Tina Brown thinks it’s “wonderful” that NYC’s plutocrats are “terrified” by Zohran Mamdani: “We have been so bullied by the super-rich.”

John Fetterman is back home after 20 stitches and some gnarly facial injuries.

Brian Glenn posted love and support for his girlfriend, Marjorie Taylor Greene, as Trump feuds with her. George Conway responded: “Seriously, it must be nice to have someone you care for stick up for you when you stand up to Trump.”

OUT AND ABOUT — At the ModSquad retreat yesterday in Charlottesville, Virginia, Rahm Emanuel was the keynote speaker, weighing in on the government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader “Chuck Schumer is not the problem, Donald Trump is and the Republicans,” Emanuel said. “They don’t come out of this really well … Do not underestimate what it meant for a president of the United States, who’s already got some preconceived negatives, to be going to the Supreme Court to deny people food, to be so cruel that he was willing to fire people because he wanted to hurt them, shut down bridges. … The contrast of that picture is cutting the food stamps and doing a ‘Great Gatsby’ party.”

Samson Signori, campaign manager for Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, also spoke at the retreat about lessons for Democrats from their victory. Signori said the campaign was laser-focused on costs and safety — and the effects of Trump’s policies, like DOGE’s civil service cuts, rather than the man himself. “It was only invoking Trump when it was having a direct impact on Trump’s economy,” Signori said.

— SPOTTED at the Belgian Embassy’s King’s Day reception Friday night: Belgian Ambassador Frédéric Bernard, USTR Jamieson Greer, Italian Ambassador Marco Peronaci, Liechtenstein Ambassador Georg Sparber, Egyptian Ambassador Motaz Zahran, Burundian Ambassador Jean Bosco Barege, Congolese Ambassador Yvette Kapinga Ngandu, Spanish Ambassador Ángeles Moreno Bau, Michael Gordon, Vera Bergengruen, Sam Skove, Olivia Gazis and Eric Martin.

— More than 1,000 Iranian-Americans gathered at the Hyatt Regency yesterday for the National Council of Resistance of Iran’s “Free Iran” convention, where speakers included Mike Pompeo, Carla Sands, Patrick Kennedy, John Bercow and Guy Benson. Pompeo called for the Abraham Accords to keep growing and said Iran’s government “is weak and more isolated than ever. Fear is its only tool.”

Zelenskyy says Ukraine is working on a prisoner exchange with Russia

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia, potentially bringing home 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced this on Sunday, following progress in negotiations. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Secretary, said Saturday that talks mediated by Turkey and the UAE focused on activating agreements brokered in Istanbul. These agreements set rules for large swaps. Meanwhile, Russian drone strikes damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region overnight into Sunday. Ukraine’s air force reported shooting down 139 drones. Ukrainian forces also struck a major oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region.

Trump says stopping suspected drug boats doesn't work. But the US reports record cocaine seizures

MIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump has justified American military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs by saying the longtime U.S. strategy of interdicting such vessels has been a major failure. Trump’s comments came around the same time that the U.S. Coast Guard announced a record year for cocaine seizures. That milestone, however, hasn't stopped the Republican president from upending decades of U.S. counternarcotics policy with a series of military strikes in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Veterans of the drug war say U.S. resources would be better spent doubling down on the traditional approach of interdicting drug boats.

Trump, like Biden before him, finds there's no quick fix on inflation

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s problems with fixing the high cost of living might be giving voters a feeling of déjà vu. Just like President Joe Biden, Trump says lower prices are just around the corner. But Biden-era officials say that argument doesn't work with impatient voters. Republicans pushed the case that Biden’s policies made inflation worse. Democrats are using that same framing today. They say Trump's tariffs are getting passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and that mass deportations have made the construction of homes more expensive. Trump says Republicans need to do a better job explaining his policies. But he also blames Biden for the economic problems.

Voters in Virginia and New Jersey send a message: It's Trump's economy now

FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — The economy and rising prices were high on the minds of voters on Election Day, and those concerns contributed to a Democratic sweep of statewide offices in Virginia and New Jersey. The voting pattern in two traditionally Republican counties in each state is evidence of how strongly Democrats campaigned on pocketbook issues. Spotsylvania County in Virginia and Morris County in New Jersey backed Donald Trump and Republican candidates for governor in earlier elections. This month, voters in those counties went with Democrats up and down the ballot. With congressional midterm elections in 2026, the November results have sent a message to conservatives who hold power in Washington.

First strong winter rains soak Gaza's makeshift shelters

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Parts of Gaza's huge Muwasi tent camp are struggling after winter's first major rainfall. Residents faced flooding and damaged infrastructure on Saturday after two years of war. They tried to dig trenches to keep water out of their tents while rain soaked their belongings. Strong winds can also topple tents and make it hard to gather food and supplies. The United Nations earlier this year said Muwasi was sheltering up to 425,000 displaced Palestinians. The Israeli defense body says it is allowing in winterization materials, but aid organizations warn these efforts are insufficient. Some people tried to shelter in destroyed buildings at risk of collapse.

The unpopular and politically weak 90-year-old Palestinian leader struggles for a role in Gaza

CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas turns 90 on Saturday, still holding power in parts of the West Bank but weakened and unpopular. Critics say his long tenure without elections has left Palestinians leaderless during an existential crisis. Hopes for a Palestinian state, central to Abbas' agenda, seem dimmer than ever. Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza is seen by many as genocide, a claim Israel denies. Abbas' Palestinian Authority is sidelined in Gaza, and critics fear Palestinians will have little voice in their future. An October poll found 80% of Palestinians want Abbas to resign.

Trump pardons Jan. 6 rioter for gun offense and woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has issued two pardons related to the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, including for a woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents who were investigating a tip that she may have been at the Capitol. In a separate case, Trump issued a second pardon for a Jan. 6 defendant who had remained behind bars despite the sweeping grant of clemency for Capitol rioters because of a separate conviction for illegally possessing firearms. It’s the latest example of Trump’s willingness to use his constitutional authority to help supporters who were scrutinized as part of the Biden administration’s massive Jan. 6 investigation that led to charges against more than 1,500 defendants.

President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in Charlotte had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations. It’s the latest step in the Trump administration’s strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of some of America’s largest cities run by Democrats.

Google data centers totaling $40 billion coming to Texas, Texas Tribune

As I wrote about this week, ERCOT hired Aurora Energy Research to run models of strategies to reduce the likelihood of rolling outages in a 2023-like heat wave or 2022-like winter storm.

There was one scenario that had zero rolling outages: high demand growth from data centers with high levels of flexibility.

The same week the report came out, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Governor Abbott appeared on a stage together to announce $40 billion in investment including 6.2 gigawatts of incremental supply and a fund for energy efficiency, which was highlighted in Governor Abbott’s statement:

“Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy,” Abbott wrote in a statement. “Google’s $40 billion investment makes Texas Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state. We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen.”

When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts | The Wall Street Journal (gift link)

Texas will clearly be a major destination for data centers. The WSJ had a great piece breaking down the realities of supply constraints facing AI developers:

The rate at which tech companies and startups are investing in AI shows no signs of slowing. In their latest financial reports, all of the big spenders revealed that their current investments had grown significantly, and projected that this trend would continue.

There is effectively “infinite” money available right now to build out new data centers, says Jim Schneider, a senior research analyst at Goldman Sachs. All this investment has translated into record spending on the stuff that goes into data centers—aka “AI supercomputers”—all those chips, servers, HVAC systems, transformers, gas turbines, power lines and power plants.

Today’s record number of data centers at the planning stage is indicative of what Raymond James managing director Frank Louthan calls “kind of a gold rush mentality.” Connecting these planned data centers to power and fiber, and finding a buyer or tenant who wants one, in that particular location is another matter.

As the chart shows below there’s about 70 gigawatts of planned power capacity in 2025 alone. Next year will almost certainly be even bigger.

The high load growth scenario modeled by Aurora was for 22 gigawatts in Texas over the next five years.

The Colorado Energy Office and the governor’s office announced in a joint news release on Thursday that homeowners could be eligible for up to $14,000 in rebates for heat pumps, electric stoves and other appliances and upgrades.

The funding was made available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law passed under former President Joe Biden that directed hundreds of billions of dollars toward clean energy and climate-related programs.

That included $140.3 million in rebates for Colorado, which are now being passed down to residents as part of the state’s Home Energy Rebate Program .

Here’s what homeowners could be eligible for:

Up to $8,000 for a cold climate heat pump for space heating or cooling

Up to $4,000 for a breaker box upgrade

Up to $2,500 for electric wiring

Up to $1,750 for a heat pump water heater

Up to $1,600 for insulation, air sealing and ventilation

Up to $840 for an electric stove, cooktop, oven or heat pump clothes dryer

The rebates are income-based. Households making below 80% of their county’s area median income are eligible to receive the full amount, while those making between 80% and 150% could see up to half.

The rebates are expected to be available through 2029, or until funds run out. These benefits are different from the federal clean energy tax credits that were also passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, some of which have already been phased out . Credits for electric vehicles ended in September, while credits for home appliances and solar installation expire on Dec. 31.

For the rebate program, homeowners must work with a registered contractor to receive the benefit. More than 55 contractors across Colorado have already begun the registration process, and the state will continue to add to the list of approved contractors over the coming weeks as more contractors complete the process.

Just days after announcing plans for a third Oklahoma data center, Google confirmed another major investment in renewable energy infrastructure—this time in Arkansas.

Arkansas Business reports the company will be the exclusive buyer of power from the $123 million Redfield Solar Farm in Grant County, located in southeast Arkansas.

The facility, owned and operated by Treaty Oak Clean Energy of Austin, Texas, spans more than 1,000 acres of solar panels and is designed to generate 100 megawatts (MW) of power—enough to supply nearly 18,000 homes.

Operations Expected to Begin in Mid-2026

Power Distributed Through Entergy Arkansas

Construction of the Redfield Solar project began earlier this year, with operations expected to start in the second quarter of 2026.

Power from the site will be transmitted through Entergy Arkansas, serving the grid operator’s 15-state region, which includes Oklahoma. Reports suggest a portion of the power may be used to operate Google’s data centers in Oklahoma, supporting the company’s expanding AI and cloud computing footprint.

A new report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that natural gas prices for utilities will rise by 37% by the end of 2025, driven by surging wholesale market costs.

While consumers are expected to feel the impact, the cost increase for end users will be significantly lower than what utilities themselves will pay.

Wholesale Prices Driving Broad Sector Increases

Electric and Industrial Sectors See Largest Jumps

The EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts that the average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will climb 37%, while prices paid by industrial customers will rise 21% compared with 2024 levels.

Smaller increases are expected for commercial and residential customers, both projected at 4% year-over-year.

Each sector’s price is partially influenced by the Henry Hub benchmark, the industry’s key indicator of natural gas spot prices. The report noted that Henry Hub prices have been higher each month compared with the same months in 2024. On an annual basis, the EIA expects the 2025 Henry Hub price to be 58% higher than in 2024.

Industrial and Power Producers Feel the Impact First

Wholesale Price Volatility Hits Major Buyers

The wholesale price of natural gas most directly affects industrial users and power generators, whose retail prices closely mirror shifts in the Henry Hub spot price.

These large-scale consumers often buy gas on a wholesale basis, covering both commodity and transmission costs. As a result, the rise in wholesale market prices will quickly translate into higher costs for utilities and industrial plants.

Retail Prices for Smaller Consumers Rise More Slowly

Regulation and Billing Cycles Moderate Increases

For residential, commercial, and small industrial customers, natural gas prices do not track wholesale spikes as closely, because utilities typically adjust rates gradually through billing cycles.

These adjustments often occur under state regulatory oversight, which can limit rapid price increases and smooth out volatility.

EIA noted that customer charges and fixed distribution fees also dilute the direct impact of wholesale fluctuations on household and small-business bills.

It seems like a day doesn’t go by without Waymo making some kind of expansion announcement. Detroit, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the cities the company plans to bring its robotaxi to in the coming months. But as I have argued in this newsletter before, there is another “expansion” I think is more important.

Freeways.

And now after years of testing and development, the company’s commercial robotaxi service is using freeways around the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.

This is a critical expansion for the company. It’s the concrete and asphalt connective tissue in sprawling metro areas like the Bay Area. This new freeway access is fueling Waymo’s expansion in that region, which is now 260 square miles and encompasses Silicon Valley and San Francisco.

Robotaxi rides can have more efficient routes too. Waymo told me it will reduce ride times by up to 50%.

And using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in.

That freeway-to-airport moment will be the big unlock for Waymo. But will it be enough to help push it in the black? Until someone over there slides me their balance sheet, I can’t say. It will certainly be a popular option for travelers. That doesn’t mean the economics will pencil out.

A little bird

It’s been nearly nine months since Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson abruptly resigned, leaving the company without a permanent replacement. That may be about to change, though.

A few little birds told us Lucid Motors has zeroed in on a candidate for the top role. It’s expected to be someone outside the organization, which is perhaps no surprise; in August, we shared here that the company and the executive hiring firm it’s using had cast a very wide net and was even cold-calling some candidates. This would likely mean that Marc Winterhoff, who’s been serving as interim CEO, would slide back to the COO role he occupied before Rawlinson left.

Deals!

Another SPAC has entered the AV world! Mergers with special acquisition companies may not be officially “back,” but they are certainly popular among autonomous vehicle companies.

Einride, the Swedish electric and autonomous truck startup, plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, just six weeks after it raised $100 million from investors. The SPAC merger with Legato Merger Corp. values Einride at $1.8 billion in pre-money equity.

Einride does generate revenue, which may sound obvious but there have been plenty of pre-revenue transportation companies that have SPAC’d in recent years.

For now, its primary source of revenue is coming from its software-as-a-service product and a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks used by companies like Heineken and PepsiCo. Its unusual-looking autonomous podlike trucks are still in pilot mode.

The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, with Einride making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

UK Gov’t Taps Rolls-Royce for Three 480 MW PWRs at Wylfa

North Wales site chosen ahead of Oldbury in England for three Rolls-Royce reactors

(NucNet contributed to this report ) The UK has chosen the island of Anglesey off the Welsh coast to host Britain’s first small modular reactors, designed by Rolls-Royce. Each PWR type unit can produce 480 MWe of power for a total of 1,440 MW or nearly the equivalent of one of the 1,650 MW EPRs being built by EDF at the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C sites.

Roll-Royce said that most of the reactor’s components will be built in “factory production” environments. According to the firm, they will be assembled into the completed reactor on-site. The effects of these plans will be to significantly reduce project risk and shorten build schedules. The Rolls-Royce SMR is expected to have a 60 year service life.

The Wylfa decision marks a major step forward for Britain’s nascent SMR industry, which the government hopes can help replace the UK’s fleet of large, ageing nuclear power plants. Nuclear currently supplies about 14% of the UK’s electricity.

In a statement the government said North Wales will become a beacon in the “golden age” of nuclear, delivering the UK’s first three SMRs at the Wylfa nuclear site in the north of the island, choosing it ahead of a rival site at Oldbury in Gloucestershire, southwest England.

The island of Anglesey is located about 90 miles west of Liverpool, U.K.

The government also announced that Great British Energy-Nuclear (GBE-N), the body overseeing new nuclear in the UK, has been tasked with identifying suitable sites that could potentially host new large-scale reactors.

GBE-N will report back by autumn 2026 on potential sites. The energy secretary, Ed Milliband, has requested this includes sites across the UK including Scotland, where the devolved Scottish National Party government is opposed to nuclear.

Any large-scale project would be similar in scale to the Hinkley Point C or Sizewell C projects, with the potential to power the equivalent of six million homes. This implies a requirement for 3.7 GWe of 24×7/365 electrical generation capacity.

The Wylfa decision marks a major step forward for Britain’s nascent SMR industry, which the government hopes can help replace the UK’s fleet of large, ageing nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy currently supplies about 14% of the UK’s electricity.

Decision ‘Rights The Wrongs’ Of Previous Failures

The government said the confirmation of Wylfa as the host site rights the wrongs of previous failure to bring new nuclear power to North Wales.

In March 2024, GBE-N bought the Wylfa and Oldbury sites from Hitachi Ltd for £160 million ($201 million). Both sites house shut-down Magnox nuclear plants and had been intended for deployment of large Hitachi advanced boiling water (BWR)reactor technology by the then Hitachi-subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power.

However, the Horizon Wylfa project was abandoned by Hitachi in early 2019 due to cost pressures and because of corporate concerns about the financial terms offered by the U.K. government. Hitachi wrote off £2.1 billion in the process. Plans for Oldbury were dropped in 2020.

The Wylfa and Oldbury projects were each expected to host twin Hitachi 1,350 MW ABWRs for a total of 5.4 GW of electrical generation capacity or 145% of the combined power expected to be generated by the two EDF reactors now under construction. The cancellation of theses projects revealed fundamental weaknesses in the ability of the UK government to address the nation’s energy security needs.

In March 2024, the government announced that an agreement had been reached to buy the Hitachi-owned sites for new nuclear at Wylfa and at Oldbury-on-Severn in southwest England. At the time, the government said said the two sites were expected to be selected for new nuclear energy projects.

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said, “Bringing nuclear back to Wylfa is a historic moment for Wales and for the UK’s clean energy future. Wylfa’s revival offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver clean, reliable power for decades to come, create thousands of skilled jobs, attract major investment, and revitalize North Wales’s proud industrial heritage.”

Potential for Further Domestic New Builds and Exports

The U.K. government also said in its press statement there is “strong export potential” for small modular reactors, after the UK and Czechia signed a deal to cooperate on civil nuclear. It comes after Rolls-Royce SMR and Czechia’s largest public company, CEZ, agreed last year to partner on SMRs, with CEZ acquiring a 20% stake. Rolls-Royce has said it has proposed building six of its SMRs in that country.

Great British Energy-Nuclear also owns the Oldbury nuclear site near Gloucester. As a site which has previously hosted a nuclear power station, it also has great potential for new nuclear, including the potential to support the privately-led projects being developed by the nuclear industry. Earlier this year the government announced a shake-up of planning rules to allow new nuclear projects including SMRs to be built in a range of sites across England and Wales including Wlyfa and Oldbury.

The Oldbury Nuclear Site, home to two of the UK’s oldest nuclear reactors that were commissoined in 1967, is 131 miles due west of London. The 217 MW Magnox reactors are now shut down and in the hands of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.

Separately, the government said it was planning to develop additional large nuclear power stations like Sizewell and Hinkley Point. The government plans to report on potential sites for gigawatt-scale reactors through Great British Energy in the near future.

Sites under consideration right now include Torness east of Edinburgh and Hunterston west of Glasgow. Westinghouse could position itself as a candidate for these future projects offering its 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR, particularly given the diplomatic pressure from the U.S. (See next story)

Funding Plans and Investors

Rolls-Royce’s SMR deal is subject to final government approvals and contract signature, expected later this year. The government has pledged £2.5 billion of funding for SMRs for the startup phase of the project o help Rolls-Royce develop three 480-MW reactors.

At $9,000/kw, each 480 MW unit would cost $4.3 billion and all three would cost $12.9 billion. The actual costs are still unknown as it will be several years before any of the units pours first concrete.

This is about 20% of the total expected cost of the three SMRs. The 80% of the cost will have to be funded by private investors. Also, Rolls-Royce may able to convince the government to authorize it to use the Regulated Asset Base method (RAB).

Under the RAB model, consumers contribute to the cost of new nuclear power projects during the construction phase – but overall the UK government estimatesconsumers are expected to save more than £30 billion over the project’s lifetime on each new large-scale nuclear power station compared with existing funding mechanisms.

Initial contributions will give private investors greater certainty through a lower and more reliable rate of return in the early stages of a project, lowering the cost of financing it, and ultimately helping reduce consumer electricity bills.

The New York Times, in its reports about the Rolls Royce decision, noted that the firm has secured investments from the Qatar Investment Authority, the Persian Gulf emirate’s sovereign wealth fund; Constellation, an American utility; and a 20% equity stakje by CEZ, the Czech Republic’s power company.

The RAB model will reduce the UK’s reliance on overseas developers for financing new nuclear projects by substantially increasing the pool of private investors to include British pension funds, insurers and other domestic institutional investors. The UK bought out China’s investment in the Sizewell C reactor project due to “security concerns.”

If the firm completes the licensing process for the SMR in 2026, as currently scheduled. first concrete could be poured as early as 2027. With a four year constuction timeline, the first unit could be in revenue service, providing returns to investors, by 2031.

Licensing the Rolls-Royce SMR in the UK

In 2022 Rolls-Royce began the U.K.’s licensing process, known as the generic design assessment, which is a three step process carried out by the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR). The firm completed Step 2 of the GDA assessment in July 2024 using the 2019 reactor design data.

Successful completion of the GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and acceptance of an environmental review. Step 3 is expected to be completed in August 2026 for a total duration of 53 months.

The costly and complex process can take three-to-five years to complete depending on how well the applicant is prepared to meet the highly prescriptive requirement of the process. This timeline means that the earliest Roll-Royce could break ground would be the 2028/2029 timeframe. It is unknown what the cost of the reactors are likely to be by then. Rolls-Royce told the BBC it plans to have the first unit in revenue service by the early 2030s. These dates suggest a four-year construction timeline.

Washington Expresses Disappointment Over Selection of Rolls-Royce

The decision to choose Rolls-Royce over its U.S. competitor Westinghouse Electric Company has drawn unusual and sharp criticism from Washington. Warren Stephens, the US Ambassador to the UK, published a statement ahead of the UK announcement expressing his disappointment with the news. The text of the complaint goes far beyond the expected boundaries of diplomatic notes between allies.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location.”

The ambassador’s unprecedented remarks suggested that Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales. What he is focused on its the full size AP1000 at 1,150 MW and not SMRs.

Stephens said: “If you want to get shovels in the ground as soon as possible and take a big step in addressing energy prices and availability, there is a different path, and we look forward to decisions soon on large-scale nuclear projects.”

“As I have repeatedly said, we want the UK to be the strongest possible ally to the United States, and high energy costs are an impediment to that,” Stephens added.

His statement gave no details of alternatives proposed by the US but it given that the Westinghouse offering is the only large reactor, that has been built elsewhere (China and U.S) that could be provided.

The UK announcement awarding the contract to Rolls-Royce appears to have caught Washington off guard, particularly given the nuclear pact the two countries made during Trump’s state visit earlier in the autumn.

The deal focused on cutting red tape in the licensing of both SMRs and full size reactors. Interestingly, that agreement cited X-Energy which is a a U.S. developer of an advanced SMR based on an 80 MW HTGR SMR design that will use TRISO HALEU enriched nuclear fuel.

A U.K. government spokesperson defended the decision to award the contract to Rolls-Royce as the right one for the UK.

“This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR program, producing homegrown clean power with a British company and we have chosen the best site for it,” the source told The Guardian. More to the point, the selection of Rolls-Royce preserves the firm’s capability to manufacture and maintain the Royal Navy’s fleet of nuclear powered submarines and surface ships.

It follows that the UK government selected Rolls-Royce for a combination of reasons having to do with energy security and national security. The US government cannot have been blind to these imperatives. It follows that the ambassador’s comments on UK internal affairs were directed by a White House reaction with an assist from industry lobbying.

Does the Westinghouse AP300 Have a Future in the UK?

It is clear that Ambassador Stephens was referring to the Westinghouse AP1000, an 1,150 MW PWR. However, the firm already has an early stage foothold in the UK for the AP300, its 300 MW SMR, which is a downsized version of the AP1000.

In February 2024 Westinghouse scored a win for its marketing efforts in the UK with an non-binding agreement in principle to build four 300 MW AP300 small modular reactors, for a total of 1.2 GW, in a privately funded project in an industrial region of the UK.

The firm has not publicly disclosed the names of its investors for the project but they are assumed to be industries in the region who want electrical power and are impatient with the glacial pace of government decision making in siting new reactors.

In a press statement the firm said, “Westinghouse Electric Company announced that it has signed an agreement with Community Nuclear Power, Ltd. (CNP) that puts it on track to deploy the UK’s first privately-financed small modular reactor fleet, with the Westinghouse AP300 SMR.”

The new power station will be sited at Seal Sands, a former chemical works. The plant closed on November 2021. Located on the shore of the Tees river, the proposed SMR plant site is adjacent to a Conoco Oil facility and upriver from an ecological reserve.

The North Teesside region of Northeast England, Middlesbrough, is located on England’s North Sea coast, 260 miles due north of London. Iron and steel have dominated the industry of both Middlesbrough and the Teesside area from the 1840s. Teesside had also become one of the major steel centers in the country, and one of the largest worldwide. Industrial decline in recent years has hampered economic development in the region.

Ship building and coal mining have also been major industries in the region. All of these industries would be logical customers in terms of offering robust demand for electricity and decarbonization of power intensive manufacturing processes. New, reliable power sources, which provide carbon free electricity, would be attractive incentives for new industry to move to the region.

Prospects for the AP300 in the U.S., as well as for the U.K., are uncertain due to the development timeline for it extending to 2030. Earlier this year, the project’s Chief Technology Officer, Rita Baranwal, jumped ship to sign on with Radient Nuclear, a developer of a micro reactor. The firm has a deal to deliver one of its units to the US Air Force and was recently named as one of ten micro reactor developers to participate in the Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Pilot Program.

Elsewhere, Westinghose has a non-binding MOU for the selection and deployment of Westinghouse technology for nuclear new build projects in New Brunswick for both grid power and dedicated industrial purposes. In 2023 Westinghouse began discussions with Ukraine to consider its AP300. In August 2024 Westinghouse was approved to submit its AP300 to the Generic Design Assessment process at the UK Office of Nuclear Regulation.

Italy’s Newcleo Shift Gears to Focus on the U.S.Market

It took just nanoseconds for Italian SMR developer NewCleo to read the U.K. tea leaves as the government in London announced it selected Rolls-Royce to build three of its 480 MW SMRs at Wylfa.

Newcleo said in a press statement is has now made a strategic shift with new plans to build 20 SMRs in the UK – a project valued at around $20 billion – in favor of pursuing opportunities in the US. The start-up also recently shifted its headquarters from Britain to France.

At the World Nuclear Exhibition in Paris, Newcleo CEO Stefano Buono told the Reuters wire service: “There are a lot of tools that are encouraging investment into the US now.”

A company spokesperson later told Reuters several steps remain before an investment commitment is made. In addition to reactor deployment, NewCleo is positioned as an investor in a joint venture with Oklo to build a $1.68 billion nuclear fuel production plant in Tennessee.

Other European Nuclear Reactor Developers Eye U.S. Nuclear Markets

Newcleo isn’t the only European nuclear energy firm taking aim at the U.S. market. Thorizon, a Franco-Dutch SMR manufacturer, is among other companies that are considering setting up operations in the US due to quicker pathways to market. While the firm has continued to pursue markets in European Union countries, it has not, so far, made any public announcements about prospects in the U.S.

Thorizon’s primary market is currently in Europe, but its focus on using nuclear waste and the development of a unique, cartridge-based molten salt reactor positions it for the future U.S. market, particularly the demand from large-scale industrial users and data centers.

A potential U.S. market strategy for Thorizon could involve:

Forming a strategic joint venture with a U.S. utility or industrial end-user.

Establishing a U.S. presence to begin pre-licensing engagement with the NRC.

Highlighting the circular fuel cycle advantage to U.S. policymakers and the public.

As of March 2025, the firm has raised $43 million in Series A funding. In August 2025 the European Union awarded the firm an additional €10 million ($11.6 million) from the Just Transition Fund (JTF).

The firm is developing a molten salt SMR. The Thorizon One will provide 250MW of industrial heat. It can also be transformed into 100MW electricity, enough to power 250.000 households. It has forged partnerships with Orano for fuel development, Tractebel for engineering, and VDL Groep for prototyping, while collaborating with EPZ for early operator input, and with EDF on R&D.

The firm faces stiff competition in the US from at least a dozen other developers of micro reactors. Additionally, any serious effort to enter the US market would require preparing a regulatory engagement plan with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Any other micro or small modular reactors developer from Europe seeking to enter the US markert would face similar challenges.

Enrichment Firms Expand US Capacity

Reuters reports that French company Orano and multinational Urenco are reportedly planning to set up new enrichment facilities in the US to cater to rising industry demand.

Orano is planning its first overseas enrichment plant near Oak Ridge, TN, for an expected $5 billion investment. Most of the planneed site is undeveloped. (Image right courtesty of Orano)

Depending on federal funding and customers’ support, the facility will produce LEU/LEU+ to fuel existing commercial nuclear energy reactors and, potentially, HALEU to help develop and power advanced reactors.

Orano aims to have its facility operational by 2031 and predicts that the US may soon become its largest market, overtaking its production of nuclear fuel in France.

Urenco currently operates a site in Eunice, NM, with capacity expansions under way. In October Urenco received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to enrich uranium up to up to 10% U235.

Urenco CEO Boris Schucht said: “A lot of customers, especially US customers, are once again supporting us with very long-term contracts for our own capacity program.”

The company’s plant in New Mexico is making about 4.3 million tons of uranium a year, with 700,000 tons of capacity being added incrementally to 2027. The company can add up to 2 million tons in additional capacity if needed, said Schucht.

Oklo Gets DOE Approval of Fuel Fabrication Safety Milestone

Oklo Announces U.S. Department of Energy Approval for Nuclear Safety Design Agreement of Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operations Office has approved the Nuclear Safety Design Agreement (NSDA) for the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), selected to participate in the DOE’s Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Project. The NSDA, the first under the DOE’s Fuel Line Pilot Project, was approved in just under two weeks.

Located at INL’s Materials Fuel Complex, the A3F, on the Arco desert about 25 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID, will fabricate fuel for Oklo’s first commercial-scale powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. Together, these facilities couple fuel production to power delivery for commercial deployment of advanced nuclear energy. Oklo plans to have the Aurora Powerhouse in operation by 2027.

Oklo and Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the Department of Energy’s management and operations contractor for INL, entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) in 2023 for Oklo to use a supply of DOE high- assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for fuel fabrication. This HALEU fuel feedstock is uranium metal recovered from Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) in the Fuel Conditioning Facility under a DOE-funded program.

Oklo was granted access to fuel material through a competitive DOE process launched in 2019. In 2019, the company received both a site-use permit at INL and access to fuel recovered from thec Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II).

The DOE review of the safety basis for nuclear facilities determines whether the safety basis has been developed in a manner that provides reasonable assurance of adequate protection of workers, the public, and the environment from adverse consequences, taking into account the work to be performed and the associated hazards.

“This approval marks clear progress toward demonstrating how we can repurpose used nuclear fuel to power the next generation of clean energy reactors,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo Inc.

“Advanced fuel fabrication and recycling technologies represent a significant unlock for our business, addressing fuel-supply challenges while transforming fuel economics and creating new revenue opportunities.”

“Approval of the NSDA for Oklo’s Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility is an important step forward,” said Robert Boston, Manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office. “We’re excited for companies selected for the Fuel Line Pilot Program to demonstrate how the United States can safely and efficiently scale the next generation of nuclear fuel manufacturing.”

Oklo Expands Collaboration with Idaho National Laboratory

on Advanced Fuels and Materials

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the management and operating contractor for Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to expand collaboration on scientific and technological research and development in areas such as advanced fuel and materials work that are mutually beneficial and support Oklo’s commercial deployment.

The collaboration plans to use Oklo’s first commercial power plant, Aurora-INL. While the Aurora powerhouse is designed for power production, it is also capable of generating fast neutrons and thereby generating valuable data through in-reactor irradiation experiments that can then be analyzed at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC).

This capability enables fast reactor irradiation testing in the US that hasn’t existed in decades. The data collected will support future fuel manufacturing improvements, cost reductions, and Oklo’s recycling efforts. By generating new fast reactor data under commercial operating conditions, Oklo aims to accelerate how it refines and qualifies its fuel and materials by leveraging its vertically integrated approach of product deployment.

Under the MOU, Oklo and INL will collaborate on irradiation of advanced nuclear fuels and materials during Aurora-INL’s operating life which could be examined at INL to better understand how fuel and materials perform in a fast- spectrum reactor environment. The resulting data would help advance U.S. fast reactor capabilities and nuclear fuel manufacturing.

The collaboration was prompted by ongoing work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Fuels Campaign (AFC) as well as a recent project supported under the DOE’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) which helped Oklo and INL test design and logistical strategies that can be incorporated into Oklo’s Aurora Powerhouse for irradiation and subsequent analysis.

LucidCatalyst Study Shows Significant Potential market for SMRs

LucidCatalyst presents a new study, “A new nuclear world: how small modular reactors can power industry.” The study has been published by Urenco, who commissioned LucidCatalyst to produce it to further industry understanding of this evolving market.

The report is supported by World Nuclear Association. It analyzes the energy demands of 11 industries representing 80% of industrial energy use, going beyond data centers to examine where SMRs can make a tangible impact on industrial energy delivery, and quantifies how changes in delivery models and market drivers can expand SMR market access. (Full text of report: PDF file)

The study sets out how the full potential of the SMR market in the industrial energy space can be unlocked, representing a $0.5–1.5 trillion investment opportunity, as energy-intensive sectors face mounting pressure to secure reliable, cost-competitive energy whilst meeting decarbonization commitments.

The key findings of the study include that:

SMRs could reach 700GW of capacity by 2050 (under the Transformation Scenario involving factory style mass manufacturing approaches to constructing SMRs). This sizable opportunity, representing nearly double the current global nuclear capacity, and would expand nuclear capacity beyond the projected goal to triple conventional deployment.

Simultaneous improvements across six areas of delivery would enable this outcome: a ‘product-based’ approach to manufacturing and licensing, freeing up sites for SMRs; stronger policy and financing support, and a more mature reactor developer environment.

The top five industries representing more than 75% of the 700GW opportunity are: synthetic fuels for aviation and maritime, coal repowering, data centers, and chemicals.

Other sectors such as food and beverage (43 GW), iron and steel (33 GW) and district energy (33 GW) also represent sizable opportunities, with district energy demand being more prevalent in Europe. Upstream oil and gas is a more prevalent opportunity in North America.

With improvements to current construction methods alone, 120GW of capacity could still be achieved by 2050 (under the Programmatic scenario, involving enhanced Government support and improved project management).

The study warns that stronger policy and financing support is needed to achieve economic viability.

“Policymakers can identify national SMR market opportunities, signal strategic priorities, and design targeted policies to address critical development bottlenecks,” the study says.

Figure 4 – In the 40 GW pipeline identified in this study, not all projects have the same level of confidence. Around 50% of this pipeline (20 GW) corresponds to projects that are actively progressing and show strong development signals (Figure 4).

These trends are consistent with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) “Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)” projections, 1/ which suggest around 19 GW of SMRs in advanced economies by 2050. These results are encouraging and confirm that the SMR potential to meet industrial energy needs is both substantiated and actively developing. (Image: Lucid Catalyst)

1/: IAEA – The Path to a New Era for Nuclear Energy

High-profile US projects include TerraPower’s construction of a Natrium SMR at a former coal site in Kemmerrer, WY, and plans to deploy four X-Energy 80 MW HTGRs SMRs to provide power for chemical giant Dow’s Seadrift plant in Texas. Amazon has unveiled plans for an SMR facility in the state of Washington, partly to power its data centers. It plans to finance the first four of 12 X-Energy SMRs at the site.

Notably, around 80% of SMR projects are being driven by non-traditional customers, primarily large industrial energy users, indicating a significant shift in the nuclear energy customer base from large publicly traded electric generation utilities.

Responses to the Study

Boris Schucht, Chief Executive of Urenco Group, said: “Decarbonizing industry presents a tremendous challenge that we must all embrace if we are to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner.”

“We believe the new-nuclear SMR market holds one of the solutions to this problem: flexible, adaptable technologies that can produce clean energy consistently and affordably.”

“This study acknowledges that with a strong focus on enabling delivery, SMRs can be maximized to their fullest and most competitive potential, significantly enhancing the ability of the nuclear industry to make an important contribution to energy security and net zero goals.”

Kirsty Gogan, Managing Partner of Lucid Catalyst, said:

“We’re witnessing a transformation in how nuclear energy services can be delivered to industrial customers. The innovations in manufacturing, licensing, and siting that this study identifies as being critical for enabling scale are already emerging in the market. With the right policy support and industry coordination across six critical areas, small modular reactors can provide a net-zero solution for energy-intensive industries requiring highly reliable, competitive, and scalable, emissions-free heat and power.”

King Lee, Head of Policy & Industry Engagement at World Nuclear Association, said:

“This study highlights the scale of opportunity for nuclear energy to support decarbonization of a wide range of industrial sectors. To realise the full potential of nuclear energy would require new regulatory frameworks and production and deployment models to unlock the economy and scale of implementation far beyond current projections.”

Affordable Financing For Nuclear Projects is the Missing Link for Success

(NucNet) Stronger international collaboration is needed in a bid to overcome financing and regulatory barriers facing nuclear energy projects in emerging economies, an event organized by the Paris-based OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) to coincide with the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil.

Speaking at a webinar, ‘Unlocking Climate Finance for Nuclear Energy in Emerging Economies’, senior executives from Africa, Asia and global institutions said access to affordable financing is “the missing link” for nuclear projects.

They said the future of nuclear power depends on collective learning, public trust, and equitable access to climate finance.

NEA director-general William Magwood warned that “financing new nuclear facilities remains one of the toughest challenges” for many developing nations, and that multilateral cooperation – including with the World Bank Group – will be essential to bridge both the financial and technical gaps.

“If we are serious about decarbonization, we must be equally serious about giving every country the tools and financial mechanisms to build reliable, clean nuclear energy.”

Nuclear ‘Vital’ To Kenya’s Long-Term Goals

Justus Wabuyabo, chief executive officer of Kenya’s Nuclear Power & Energy Agency (NuPEA) told the webinar that Kenya views nuclear energy as vital to its long-term economic and environmental goals.

He said Kenya completed phase one of its nuclear power program in 2023, focusing on stakeholder engagement and policy readiness, and is now preparing for phase two, due to be completed by 2027. The country plans to begin construction of its first nuclear power plant by 2034.

“The Kenyan government recognizes that nuclear energy will play a crucial role in powering industrialization and creating jobs,” Wabuyabo said.

“It’s not just about energy; it’s about aligning with our climate strategy and supporting national development.”

However, Wabuyabo acknowledged the public has lingering doubts about nuclear technology.

“We must continue building trust,” he said, noting that partnerships with organizations such as the NEA could help Kenya develop robust safety frameworks and transparent communications with communities.

Loyiso Tyabashe, group chief executive of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (NECSA), said South Africa is extending the life of its existing nuclear reactors by up to two decades while also exploring new build options.

Tyabashe said financial planning must precede vendor negotiations, cautioning against premature commitments before securing sustainable capital.

“Quality is linked to the cost of capital,” he said. “Before we even think about technology vendors, we must address financing models. That’s where institutions like the World Bank can be real trend-setters.”

He said Necsa, a public body that carries out nuclear research and development, supports broader African collaboration on nuclear technology, research and skills development and said shared learning can help reduce project costs and ensure regulatory alignment across borders.

Giovanni Carlo Bacardo, undersecretary at the Department of Energy of the Philippines, said his country’s progress depends on access to climate finance and the inclusion of nuclear energy in green taxonomies – the classifications used by investors and international institutions to define sustainable projects.

“For countries like the Philippines, the recognition of nuclear energy as green energy is key to unlocking financing,” Bacardo said. “We are committed to safety and sustainability, but access to affordable capital remains the missing link.”

World Bank ‘Can Be A Trend-Setter’

Lauren Claire Culver, senior energy specialist at the World Bank, which recently signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to cooperate on the development and financing of nuclear power for developing countries, acknowledged that while the organization recognizes nuclear power’s potential role in the global clean energy transition, it still faces an internal knowledge and experience gap.

“We understand the importance of nuclear in addressing climate change,” Culver said, “but the World Bank has limited practical experience in the sector”.

Culver proposed the creation of an advisory board to strengthen dialogue between the World Bank, nuclear regulators and national agencies in emerging economies. She also suggested introducing grant-based resources to help developing countries borrow for technical assistance, capacity building, and regulatory compliance.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oldbury-site.png,N,,2025-11-16 13:59:43.735070

According to Charged Electric Vehicles Magazine, the process could pump out high-capacity electrodes at a record pace without the use of solvents or ""forever chemicals"" (PFAS).

Powered by Ateios' RaiCure platform, the system can coat electrodes at a speed of 80 meters (262 feet) per minute, nearly three times faster than the standard 30 meters (98 feet) per minute for fluorine-polymer-based electrodes.

Electrode coating is crucial to the battery manufacturing process, as it creates a defect-free surface and directly affects a battery's performance, efficiency, and lifespan. Despite its high speed, the system produces electrodes that work with graphite, lithium cobalt oxide, nickel manganese cobalt, and lithium-iron phosphate battery material.

The fact that the system works with various materials is significant because LFP batteries are made from more abundant materials, which makes them less expensive to manufacture and, presumably, cheaper and more widely available to a broader consumer base.

The manufacturing will take place at Kodak's facility in Rochester, New York. Although the companies state that it will take only two to three months to take a new battery design from lab concept to commercial-scale production, according to Eastman Kodak chief technical officer Terry Taber, the development stage will take a few years, per RochesterFirst.com.

As the world continues to electrify, with EV global sales continuing to rise, it's key that companies such as Ateios can produce quality components at a rate that keeps up with demand.

Innovations such as this could make EVs more affordable. Along with the savings on gas and general maintenance, it could go a long way in convincing consumers to make their next car an EV, reducing the number of gas-powered vehicles on the road and the planet-heating pollution they create.

Home solar is a great way to boost the savings from owning or leasing an EV. EnergySage is a TCD-vetted source that offers tools that allow homeowners to compare quotes from local installers.

The shift toward the sector’s supply chain — from power generators to materials used in data centers — reflects growing concern over lofty valuations in pure-play AI stocks. Analysts say firms supporting the tech ecosystem offer a more affordable entry point into this year’s hottest theme.

The pivot is already showing up in the market. An index tracking Chinese energy stocks rallied 10% in October, and is on track to beat the CSI 300 Index for a second straight month. Seven of the top 10 gainers on the benchmark in the past month are tied to AI infrastructure.

“No power, no AI,” BofA Securities analysts including Matty Zhao wrote in a note dated Oct. 31. They argue that China is better positioned than the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia due to its vast generation capacity, lower power costs, and abundant renewable energy.

By 2030, about one-third of China’s total AI spending will go toward building the supporting facilities, with metals, power, and cooling systems taking the bulk of the outlay, the investment bank estimates.

Here are some of the likely beneficiaries of this boom:

Power Equipment

Power equipment makers are reaping the rewards as data centers drive up electricity demand. UBS Group AG recently doubled its forecast of power demand growth in China to 8% by 2028-2030, citing data centers, exports and electrification as key drivers.

“We prefer local power equipment manufacturers,” said Ken Liu, head of Greater China energy transition & renewables research at a briefing Wednesday, citing the government’s plan to boost energy infrastructure investment in its next five-year plan.

Shares of solar energy equipment maker CSI Solar Co. have jumped 31% this month, while those of electrical component producer TBEA Co. have rallied nearly 21% in the same period. In contrast, the CSI 300 has remained little changed. Even after the rally, the CSI 300 Energy Index trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 13 — well below the multiple of 34 for the index’s information technology sub-gauge.

AI Metals

Metals used to build data centers and other AI facilities — such as servers and energy systems — are another area that’s getting a second look. Prices have been rising, with more analysts now viewing them as affordable ways to invest in the AI boom.

BofA Securities said data centers are becoming a key driver for China’s copper demand, estimating that the metal’s use in these facilities will grow at an average annual rate of 20% through 2030. The brokerage also expects the rally in aluminum stocks to continue.

Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. is among the best performing stocks on the CSI 300 Index over the past month, with around 35% gain, while Shandong Nanshan Aluminum Co. and Yunnan Aluminium Co. have each gained about 30%.

Energy Storage System

Demand for emergency backup equipment is also expected to grow, as data centers seek to maintain uninterrupted power during outages, analysts say.

“This segment is expected to make a significant contribution to A-share listed companies in the future,” said Yishu Yan, a China utilities analyst at UBS Securities.

Citigroup Inc. analysts said the spillover could exceed expectations if the data center growth outlook lines up with rising energy storage demand. That would make renewable energy firms and electric vehicle battery makers likely beneficiaries.

CATL’s Shenzhen-listed shares closed at a new record high on Thursday, after Beijing Hyperstrong Technology said it had locked in an order for 200 gigawatt hours of energy storage batteries from the company. Other battery materials makers also rose, including Shenzhen Capchem Technology, Shenzhen Senior Technology Material, and Eve Energy.

Optical Fibre

Makers of optical transceivers — used to link thousands of advanced chips known as graphics processing units in AI clusters — have also witnessed a sharp rally.

Shares of Zhongji Innolight Co., Eoptolink Technology Inc. and Suzhou TFC Optical Communication Co. have all recorded triple-digit gains this year, making them some of the top performers on China’s onshore equity benchmark.

Those numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change.

Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report’s findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.

There’s no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects, which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy.

We also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan.

You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.

Kirsten: Here’s what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who’s our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It’s a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center.

So to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it.

But of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.

Rebecca: I mean, it’s a lot. And a lot of that’s coming from the U.S. I think that report found that half of the electricity demand will be coming from the U.S., and the rest is a mix of China and Europe.

And another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. So that means there’s a lot more challenge with the grid connection and with connection pathways. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it’s just good business, it’s not because of any environmentally friendly policies.

Kirsten: Redwood Materials’ new business unit, Redwood Energy, is going to be an interesting company to watch with this. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they’re taking the old EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled, and then they’re creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. And that, to me, would alleviate the problem or the concern that you just mentioned.

The question is: Are other companies going to do this? Are there other Redwood Energies out there that are trying to do the same thing? And how much of an impact could they make? Because I do think that like the pressure on the electrical grid, especially during certain times of the year, like in the middle of the summer, for instance, places like Texas that have rolling brownouts and blackouts, that is going to be a real concern. And it could spur a whole new kind of investment into companies doing what Redwood is doing.

Anthony: It also underlines this question about what is that going to do to the spaces that we live in? Even if they’re not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale.

And then, of course, there’s also this question of how much of [the planned data centers are] actually going to get built because there’s definitely very ambitious plans that require huge amounts of spending.

To start with OpenAI, that’s a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade. And then there was this whole controversy over their CFO saying, “The government should backstop our loans to build these data centers.” And then she’s like, “No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t mean backstop, that was a poor choice of words,” but it does look like they have been asking for an expansion of tax credits from the CHIPS Act.

I think that this is going to be an effort that’s not just going to fall on the companies, but also on the government — or at least that’s going to be a question that the government is considering over the next few years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1475927398.jpeg?resize=1200,674",N,,2025-11-16 13:00:39.575278

Countries around the world have been discussing the need to rein in climate change for three decades, yet global greenhouse gas emissions — and global temperatures with them — keep rising.

When it seems like we’re getting nowhere, it’s useful to step back and examine the progress that has been made.

Let’s take a look at the United States, historically the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. Over those three decades, the U.S. population soared by 28 percent and the economy, as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for inflation, more than doubled.

Yet U.S. emissions from many of the activities that produce greenhouse gases — transportation, industry, agriculture, heating and cooling of buildings — have remained about the same over the past 30 years. Transportation is a bit up; industry a bit down. And electricity, once the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, has seen its emissions drop significantly.

Overall, the U.S. is still among the countries with the highest per capita emissions, so there is room for improvement, and its emissions haven’t fallen enough to put the country on track to meet its pledges under the 10-year-old Paris climate agreement. But U.S. emissions are down about 15 percent over the past 10 years.

Here’s how that happened:

U.S electricity emissions have fallen: U.S. electricity use has been rising lately with the shift toward more electrification of cars and heating and cooling and expansion of data centers, yet greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are down by almost 30 percent since 1995.

One of the main reasons for this big drop is that Americans are using less coal and more natural gas to make electricity.

Both coal and natural gas are fossil fuels. Both release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere when they are burned to make electricity, and that carbon dioxide traps heat, raising global temperatures. But power plants can make electricity more efficiently using natural gas compared with coal, so it produces fewer emissions per unit of power.

Why did the U.S. start using more natural gas?

Research and technological innovation in fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed companies to extract more oil and gas at lower cost, making it cheaper to produce electricity from natural gas rather than coal.

As a result, utilities have built more natural gas power plants; especially super-efficient combined-cycle gas power plants, which produce power from gas turbines and also capture waste heat from those turbines to generate more power. More coal plants have been shutting down or running less.

Because natural gas is a more efficient fuel than coal, it has been a win for climate in comparison, even though it’s a fossil fuel. The U.S. has reduced emissions from electricity as a result.

Significant improvements in energy efficiency, from appliances to lighting, have also played a role. Even though tech gadgets seem to be recharging everywhere all the time today, household electricity use, per person, plateaued over the first two decades of the 2000s after rising continuously since the 1940s.

Costs for renewable electricity, batteries fall: U.S. renewable electricity generation, including wind, solar and hydro power, has nearly tripled since 1995, helping to further reduce emissions from electricity generation.

Costs for solar and wind power have fallen so much that they are now cheaper than coal and competitive with natural gas. Fourteen states, including most of the Great Plains, now get at least 30 percent of their power from solar, wind and battery storage.

While wind power has been cost competitive with fossil fuels for at least 20 years, solar photovoltaic power has only been competitive with fossil fuels for about 10 years. So expect deployment of solar PV to continue to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally, even as U.S. federal subsidies disappear.

Both wind and solar provide intermittent power: The sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. There are a number of ways utilities are dealing with this. One way is to use demand management, offering lower prices for power during off-peak periods or discounts for companies that can cut their power use during high demand. Virtual power plants aggregate several kinds of distributed energy resources — solar panels on homes, batteries and even smart thermostats — to manage power supply and demand. The U.S. had an estimated 37.5 gigawatts of virtual power plants in 2024, equivalent to about 37.5 nuclear power reactors.

Another energy management method is battery storage, which is just now beginning to take off. Battery costs have come down enough in the past few years to make utility-scale battery storage cost-effective.

What about driving? In the U.S., gasoline consumption has remained roughly constant but fuel efficiency has generally improved over the decades.

Sales of electric vehicle, which could cut emissions more, have been slow, however. Some of this could be due to the success of fracking: U.S. petroleum production has increased, and gasoline and diesel prices have remained relatively low.

People in other countries are switching to electric vehicles more rapidly than in the U.S. as the cost of EVs has fallen. Chinese consumers can buy an entry-level EV for under $10,000 in China with the help of government subsidies, and the country leads the world in EV sales.

In 2024, people in the U.S. bought 1.6 million EVs, and global sales reached 17 million, up 25 percent from the year before.

The unknowns ahead: What about data centers? The construction of new data centers, in part to serve the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, is drawing a lot of attention to future energy demand and to the uncertainty ahead.

Data centers are increasing electricity demand in some locations, such as northern Virginia, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago and Atlanta. The future electricity demand growth from data centers is still unclear, though, meaning the effects of data centers on electric rates and power system emissions are also uncertain.

However, AI is not the only reason to watch for increased electricity demand: The U.S. can expect growing electricity demand for industrial processes and electric vehicles, as well as the overall transition from using oil and gas for heating and appliances to using electricity that continues across the country.",https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/40798791_web1_TSR-251115-edh-opi-climate-green-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 13:00:54.299800

While the approval is a step in the right direction, a recent court ruling has placed the project in peril and in the crosshairs of the new administration as it aims to roll back permits and policies for the wind power sector in the United States.

The Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board has given its approval for the transmission cable route

The SouthCoast Wind project now has the required approval from the regional regulator for the planned route of the necessary transmission cables for the project. The venture plans to run cables from up the Sakonnet River and across Portsmouth to Mount Hope Bay, connecting the region’s wind power generation at an accelerated pace.

While the approval is a step in the right direction for SouthCoast wind, there have been some new developments that are a cause for concern. Putting aside the current administration’s evident disdain for the wind power sector, a recent ruling by a federal court in DC has raised concerns over the project even being built in the future.

Power purchase agreements for the SouthCoast Wind project are nowhere to be found

Essential to any energy project are the long-term power purchasing agreements that exist between supplier and customer. With the November 1st deadline for PPAs having come and gone, there are no purchasing agreements between the project developer and Massachusetts and Rhode Island utility suppliers. This comes amid growing uncertainty over the wind power sector’s future in Trump’s America.

The Trump administration is rolling back the progress made by the previous President

Biden enacted several measures and policies aimed at shifting the American energy sector towards the renewable energy market. However, a recent request by the Trump administration to roll back permits and review the policies aimed at the wind power sector has been granted by a federal court judge in Washington, DC.

The court’s decision is a major setback for the already struggling project. Despite the approval given for the planned route of transmission cables, the court’s ruling allows the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to establish a new review of potential environmental and economic consequences for the project. Approval for wind projects has been under the spotlight in recent months, not just in the US, but in Australia as well.

“We are currently assessing the implications of the decision and will consider all appropriate next steps, including the pursuit of legal remedies, to ensure the project’s integrity and its long-term contribution to regional and national energy goals.” – Michael Brown, CEO and president for SouthCoast Wind

A clarifying note from COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago is expected today which is anticipated to provide more information on how they intend to resolve outstanding issues in week two. As ministers arrive for the final week of negotiations, answers on how to address the huge shortfall in countries’ emissions reductions commitments, a phaseout of fossil fuels as part of a just transition to a clean energy economy, adaptation, and climate finance are important barometers of progress toward a successful outcome at COP30.

There were some promising bright spots through the week, including growing support for a transition away from fossil fuels, progress on bolstering information integrity to counter climate disinformation and improving synergies between the Rio Conventions to enhance cooperation across international organizations.

Experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) are on the ground in Belém tracking the negotiations and other central issues of importance at COP30.

Below is a statement by Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.

“The first week of COP30 was marked by generally constructive negotiations, but pressure is building as major breakthroughs on critical topics have yet to materialize. Nations repeatedly lamented the vast gulf in ambition between current emission reduction commitments and what’s needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, but a process for how to address that shortfall in an equitable way is still to be decided. Brazil has proposed a roadmap for a transition away from fossil fuels, which is gathering a growing groundswell of support from many countries who recognize the tremendous benefits of renewable energy. Getting the details right will be important to ensure a fair, funded transition and to fend off attacks from fossil fuel interests.

“Securing a strong outcome on climate adaptation is a top issue for climate vulnerable low-income nations and the call has only grown increasingly urgent as climate impacts rapidly worsen around the world. Crucially, a lack of adequate climate finance from richer nations most responsible for the climate crisis remains a festering source of frustration and distrust for lower-income countries.

“It’s up to political leaders to step up to bridge divides between countries in the second week of COP30 and secure a strong outcome that delivers for communities around the world. The stakes are abundantly clear as the world teeters on the brink of breaching 1.5 C of warming and climate change-charged extreme disasters like typhoons and hurricanes take a steep toll on people’s lives and nations’ economies.”

Dr. Cleetus also has a new blog post: As Week One Winds Down at COP30 in Brazil, What’s at Stake and What’s Ahead

Below is a statement by Kate Cell, senior climate campaign manager at UCS and Climate Action Against Disinformation steering committee member and policy working group co-chair.

“This is the first COP where accurate, consistent and reliable information about climate change is on the action agenda. The COP that launched a Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change, signaling unprecedented international collaboration to address pernicious disinformation. The ‘COP of Truth.’ After decades of deceit, denial and delay, the fossil fuel industry and their allies are on notice. And while 12 governments have committed to working together for common-sense, human-rights based solutions, many more must take the opportunity to work together for information integrity.

“This initiative requires holding legacy media, social media and search engines to basic, human-rights based standards of transparency, accountability and safety. Governments, the private sector and funders all have important roles to play. In particular, Big Tech is currently amplifying and monetizing disinformation on a range of topics including climate change, and must instead commit to truth over short-term profits.”

UCS will be monitoring nations as they decide whether to support the Declaration in week two.

Below is a statement by Dr. Astrid Caldas, senior climate scientist for community resilience at UCS.

“The interconnectedness of biodiversity and climate change has been brought to the forefront here in Belém. Taking place in the heart of a biodiversity-rich area, the role of forests and Indigenous and local communities in slowing climate change has been a focal point both in negotiations and civil society fora. Indigenous peoples in particular play an integral role in conservation and stewardship of the land and have been a constant presence at this COP, asserting their rights to land and a seat at the negotiations table. This role can be further prioritized through better synergy between the Rio Conventions, a recommendation supported by many countries and non-governmental organizations. Continued discussions aiming to enhance cooperation among the Rio Conventions and other international groups and frameworks are a welcome signal to better addressing climate change, biodiversity and desertification together. Just as these problems are intertwined, so too must be the unified global response to effectively solve them.”

No, really.

There have been enormous strides in renewable energy use around the world, from Pakistan to Ghana, California to Texas, made possible by everyday people who recognize that using the ball of fire in the sky to power the grid is much more affordable and efficient than fossil fuels and also happens to require no burning, or wars, as environmentalist Bill McKibben has pointed out.

In Illinois, recent legislation will phase out the use of harmful “forever chemicals” in manufacturing, and the number of native gardens surges as more homeowners join the effort to support birds, insects and healthy soil.

Here in Lake County, voters overwhelmingly approved last fall a $155 million bond referendum for the Lake County Forest Preserve District. The district recently issued the first $25 million; the funds will allow us to acquire and restore more land, as well as fund capital projects to increase accessibility for residents throughout the county.

It might seem obvious why we would want to acquire additional open space — more trails to walk, rivers to kayak, beautiful vistas to enjoy. And all of that is true. But healthy open space is also valuable. Some examples:

• Flood control: During the record 2017 floods, LCFPD wetlands held millions of gallons of rainwater. Had those wetlands been paved over, surrounding homes and businesses would have been damaged or destroyed. As more wetlands lose federal protection, it’s imperative for local entities to step up.

• Food production: Pollinators rely on quality habitat and farmers rely on pollinators — honeybee-pollinated commodities alone account for $15 billion in annual U.S. agricultural production, according to the Illinois Farm Bureau.

• Workforce attraction: Homebuyers consistently cite open space as a priority. It’s no wonder that Lake County, with its strong tradition of valuing nature, was recently named one of the top 10 counties in the United States for economic development.

• Health care savings: Studies show the closer one lives to green space, the less they spend on health care — by the hundreds of dollars per year — even taking into account variables like age and income.

Depending on who and what is impacted, the value of a restored acre — meaning, land returned to its natural state — is estimated in the thousands to the tens of thousands of dollars per acre, per year.

Every year.

Today, LCFPD manages about 11,000 acres of restored land. That is a value in the tens of millions of dollars in the form of clean air, water, and soil, flood reduction, pollinator support, carbon storage and more. If LCFPD had the operational funds to restore all 31,500 of its acres ...? Well, you do the math.

One thing is clear: nature is a sound investment.

One of our goals with the referendum dollars is to acquire an additional 2,000 acres, a value potential in the millions of dollars every year, year after year — as long as we taxpayers continue to support the maintenance of restored acres. Because as every gardener knows, it takes constant upkeep.

Americans agree on so much. We value clean air in our lungs and clean water flowing through lakes and rivers. We value the shade of an oak and healthy local food powered by pollinators. We value, and depend on, the quality-of-life nature provides.

November 16, 2025

WASHINGTON — We are happy to report the federal opened back up on Wednesday. In addition to articles already covered by Native News Online, here is a roundup of other news released from Washington, D.C. that impacts Indian Country recently.

Rep. Sharice Davids (D-KS), a tribal citizen of the Ho-Chunk Nation, on Wednesday released a statement following the U.S. House’s passage of the latest government funding bill.

""I’ve said for weeks that we’ve got to come together and find a bipartisan compromise to open the government again, but this can’t be at the expense of threatening health care for the more than 160,000 Kansans who rely on ACA credits to afford care and the thousands more who will see skyrocketing health care premiums. While I’m grateful that federal workers will be back on the job and getting paid, I could not support this government funding bill without any commitment from Speaker Johnson to hold a vote to extend health care credits so that costs don’t surge for Kansas families. Kansans are sick of the political gamesmanship in Washington while people in Kansas pay the price. I am committed to keep fighting in every way I can to bring down the cost of care for Kansans.""

Interior Rescinds 2024 Rule on Alaska Petroleum Reserve to Expand Energy Development

The Department of the Interior on Thursday announced a final rule rescinding the 2024 Bureau of Land Management regulation governing the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska, a move officials say will help unlock the energy potential of the roughly 23-million-acre reserve.

""By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,"" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ""This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.""

Established in 1923, the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska has long been designated to support U.S. energy security. By reversing the 2024 rule, Interior officials say they are advancing efforts to bolster American energy dominance and reduce reliance on foreign oil.

The final rule implements direction from President Donald J. Trump under Executive Order 14153, issued on his first day in office, and responds to calls from Alaskans — including North Slope leaders — to reinstate the prior regulatory framework. Department officials say the change will allow them to focus on expanding responsible development to support Alaska’s economy, national security, and domestic energy production.

The Bureau of Land Management will now proceed with managing the reserve under new 2025 regulations aligned with those originally established in 1977. Agency officials say reversing the 2024 rule will ease regulatory burdens and position the reserve to deliver broader economic benefits for the nation and North Slope communities.

Between 2000 and 2021, the loan portfolios of South-led development banks also rose significantly. It went from $7.2 billion to $73.4 billion, a tenfold increase.

Promoting Clean Energy and Job Creation

India’s demonstration of converting unused cotton plant parts into clean energy and creating employment opportunities for participants from African countries is a notable example of South-South cooperation.

As India strode towards clean energy, entrepreneurs began utilising the unwanted parts of crops for renewable energy. Instead of setting the waste on fire, a practice that has led to pollution, India has set up more than 500 briquetting plants. Briquetting is a process of converting unused plant parts into clean fuel by forming pellets or briquettes as a substitute for coal and wood.

UNCTAD report highlighted the untapped potential of briquetting in Zambia, where farmers could earn an additional $3 million each year by processing cotton waste into briquettes. Not just Zambia, but cotton farmers globally could greatly benefit from the production of this renewable energy.

Therefore, in 2019, UNCTAD offered officials from Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe the opportunity to visit India and develop a better understanding of the technology. UNCTAD chose India because its cotton production resembles that of these countries, making the technology and equipment adaptable.

South-South Cooperation and the Pandemic

Over the past few years, the converging effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising global food and energy insecurity, and the climate crisis have had a profound impact on the world. For countries in the Global South that were already vulnerable, the high inflation and slowed economic growth in the post-pandemic period, along with droughts, fires, and floods that the climate emergency has brought about, have made things considerably more difficult. In Southeast Asia, the pandemic pushed 4.7 million people into extreme poverty. It undermined the region’s economic and development progress, leading to millions losing their job during the pandemic’s peak.

While there has been a strong recovery, with a 4.6% increase in GDP growth in 2024, millions still face job insecurity and unemployment. As developing countries grapple with these changes, South-South cooperation fosters more sustainable economic growth by driving collective self-resilience.

Promoting Decent Work

The ILO ProSSCE-ASEAN is a project actively working to counteract the post-COVID economic backsliding in the Global South and to achieve decent work for all, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 8.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) launched the Promoting the Global Development Initiative with a focus on South-South cooperation in Employment in ASEAN project in partnership with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China. In Cambodia, the project has partnered with the government and local organisations to connect close to 150,000 young people and marginalised groups to high-quality jobs since 2023.

In Indonesia, the project launched a four-tiered training program to improve job matching by training more than 3,000 public employment counsellors across the country and implementing labour market programmes that are inclusive and gender-responsive. Following the success of the programme in Indonesia, the ILO is set to expand the four-tiered training to other countries in Southeast Asia.

Strengthening South-South Health Cooperation

The pandemic disproportionately affected women and children, particularly in the developing world. It led to a reversal of progress in maternal health, which is a key indicator of health.

In response to this, the World Health Organization (WHO) partnered with the Health Development Partnership for Africa and the Caribbean (HeDPAC) to foster South-South health cooperation between the regions. The initiative brought together countries from Africa and the Caribbean to exchange innovative primary health care solutions, with a focus on maternal and child health.

As the world continues to navigate crises, South-South Cooperation provides a strong framework that encourages solidarity, knowledge sharing, and mutual support among developing countries. Its initiatives aim to foster development based on fairness and resilience, creating an inclusive and sustainable world.

Global EV sales are not just holding steady—they’re accelerating. According to the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025, published in May, electric car sales are projected to exceed 20 million units this year, representing more than one in four cars sold worldwide. This comes despite economic headwinds and policy shifts in key markets.

The narrative of a slowdown has been fueled by selective reporting, but industry analysts argue it’s misleading. A recent article from Electrek highlights how, after two years of dire predictions, EV sales continue to rise, defying claims of cooling demand. ‘EV sales keep defying false media narratives that they are dropping, and continue to rise,’ the piece states, pointing to record-breaking figures in multiple regions.

The Myth of Stagnation

Delving deeper, U.S. sales data from CarEdge, updated as of November 14, 2025, shows electric vehicles capturing 7.9% market share in February, with Tesla leading at 45.2%. This is part of a broader trend where Q3 2025 saw 438,000 units sold—a 30% increase—driven by buyers rushing to claim federal tax credits before potential phase-outs, as reported by MotorWatt.

Globally, BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook, released in June, forecasts EVs comprising one in four cars sold in 2025. China remains the powerhouse, but emerging markets are gaining traction. S&P Global Mobility predicts a 30% rise in battery electric passenger vehicle sales to 15.1 million units, underscoring robust growth.

Regional Dynamics Driving Growth

In Europe and the U.S., the electric commercial vehicle maintenance, repair, and overhaul market is booming, projected to reach $8,440.2 million by 2035 at a 24% CAGR, per Industry Today. India’s EV sales surged to 234,191 registrations in October, up from September, according to EVreporter.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect this optimism. Users like Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, noted in May that ‘in 2024, 1 in 5 cars sold worldwide was electric. In 2025, it’s set to be more than 1 in 4.’ Another post from BloombergNEF emphasizes China’s lead and emerging markets’ takeoff.

Policy Shifts and Market Resilience

Despite U.S. policy uncertainties, including potential tax credit changes, sales momentum persists. Virta Global reports that the number of electric vehicles on roads in 2025 continues to climb, with forecasts pointing to sustained expansion. EV-Volumes provides real-time data showing top models and charging network growth, reinforcing market health.

The Electrek article calls out media sensationalism: ‘After two years of headlines begging for failure, EV sales keep defying false media narratives.’ This echoes sentiments in QY Research’s report, which projects the global EV market to hit $1,257.03 billion by 2031 at a 15.9% CAGR, driven by players like Tesla, BYD, and Volkswagen.

Innovation Fueling Adoption

Technological advancements are key. Future Market Insights forecasts U.S. all-electric multipurpose goods vehicle demand at $298.7 million by 2035, growing at 6.1%. Bloomberg Opinion, citing historical projections, notes EV market share could reach 58% by 2040, with Tesla’s dominance growing.

X posts highlight competitive landscapes: One user points out Tesla’s top-selling models globally, while another notes BYD’s expansion overtaking rivals. Marcelo Mena-Carrasco posted that ‘EVs aren’t “stalling” — they’re surging. Global EV sales are on track for ~22M in 2025.’

Challenges Amid the Surge

Not all is smooth—supply chain issues and battery costs remain hurdles. A 2022 X post from Andy Lee warned of lithium prices tripling, impacting costs, yet sales have soared regardless. Car Dealership Guy forecasted in January that 25% of new vehicles in 2025 would be electrified, with gas engines dropping to 75%.

Edmunds, via KESQ, reports Tesla’s 45.2% U.S. share, but competitors like GM’s Chevy Equinox EV are gaining. OpenPR’s analysis sees transformative growth through sustainability and innovation.

Investor Perspectives and Future Outlook

Investors are bullish. Sawyer Merritt’s X post cites S&P Global’s 30% growth prediction. KRoshan’s post details China’s 32% sales increase, capturing over one-third of the market.

Red/ Snow on X references surging 2025 sales data from multiple sources, countering skepticism. Donald E. Thompson notes global sales jumping from 40,000 annually a decade ago to 22 million in 2025.

Strategic Shifts by Automakers

Automakers are adapting. Ford’s pivot to hybrids amid F-150 Lightning challenges is noted in X discussions, while Rivian and Lucid face cash flow issues. Yet, overall, the sector thrives.

The IEA’s report emphasizes that despite uncertainties, EV adoption is breaking records. As Fatih Birol stated, ‘Global sales of electric cars continue to break records.’

Charging Infrastructure and Market Maturity

Infrastructure lags in some areas, but progress is evident. Y∪² on X predicts EVs dominating in five years with better tech and lower prices, possibly needing state aid for remote charging.

Carlos on X highlights Tesla’s lead, with BYD’s profits declining but still competitive. This competitive churn drives innovation, as per BloombergNEF.

Economic Impacts and Global Reach

The economic ripple is vast. OpenPR forecasts EV market growth through emissions reduction and tech innovation. Europe’s MRO market growth signals maturing ecosystems.

In summary of trends, EV sales defy naysayers, propelled by policy, tech, and consumer shifts. As Electrek asserts, the media’s ‘lying’ narrative ignores the data-driven reality of a booming industry.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/article-1344-1763265029.jpeg,N,,2025-11-16 12:02:05.209661

The Hoosiers enter a much-needed bye week with control of their own destiny for the Big Ten championship and a national championship. Here’s the stock report for IU after week 12.

Stock Up

IU Fan Base

Indiana has sold out their last nine conference home games and have created a home field advantage that head coach Curt Cignetti was raving about after the win over Wisconsin.

“Our fans are the best in America. I know everybody says that that’s got it going and packs the house, but I love our fans. I know where we started and where we are now, and they are over the top. I can’t say enough good things about them. We feed off of their energy. I really think that us playing at home is at least a 14-point advantage.” Cignetti said.

On top of that, multiple people challenged the fans to stay and give a final salute to this team as it looks like Saturday was IU’s final home game of the 2025 season. They answered the bell as about 80-percent of the fans gave a loud ovation as the final gun sounded and the game was over (it did help that it was a beautiful day).

Bye Week Excitement

Usually there are grumbles that a bye week is coming during an undefeated season as fans want to see this team play, but IU needs the bye week. I believe fans understand that too. The Hoosiers are banged up after a six-game stretch that included trips to Oregon and Penn State.

It is a lot easier to enjoy a bye week when your team is 11-0 and the second ranked team in the country. There are several games IU fans will be keeping their eye on this week in the Big Ten (USC at Oregon, Rutgers at Ohio State, Michigan at Maryland) while the mighty SEC takes their annual pre-thanksgiving cupcake festival.

Second Half Performance

The first half of Saturday’s game left a lot to be desired. IU allowed Wisconsin to control the clock and play their style of football. IU led 10-7, but allowed 145 yards of offense. The second half was a different story. IU outscored the Badgers 21-0 and held the Badgers to just 23 yards of offense. The defense also scored 14 points off of two Badger turnovers. IU closed out the game on a 24-0 run, something IU fans have been used to seeing under Cignetti.

Stock Down

Offensive Line

The Indiana offensive line is missing Drew Evans and was severely limited because of Kahlil Benson being banged up. IU allowed five sacks and seven tackles for loss. Last week against Penn State, IU surrendered three sacks. While quarterback Fernando Mendoza did hold on to the ball too long on some plays, he is taking too many hits. Eight sacks in the last two games nearly came to a head when Mendoza was a little slow and wobbly getting up in the fourth quarter Saturday.

First Half Tackling

One of the reasons why Indiana started slowly was their issues with tackling again. The Hoosiers struggled on Wisconsin’s first drive, and really the first half, with angles and wrapping up. According to Pro Football Focus, IU missed six tackles yesterday.

“We just came out flat, honestly. We didn’t have a lot of energy. Some guys weren’t ready to go, and I will take the blame for that. I don’t think I was ready to go. I think I could’ve had more energy and been more of a sparkplug for the team. You know, (it’s) something we have got to work on. We can’t have that in a big game. So, we have to eliminate that now, get back to training towards the end of the season. We are looking forward to Purdue and writing that off.” Indiana linebacker Aiden Fisher said.

Injuries

The Hoosiers are more banged up than the official availability says they are. IU was without starters wide receiver Elijah Sarratt and Drew Evans to start the game and then saw starters EJ Williams, Kaelon Black, Kahlil Benson and Mikail Kamara leave the game early as well. IU already lost Lee Beebe, Bryson Bonds and Kellan Wyatt for the season. IU needs to get healthy.

Hold

Undefeated Regular Season

There is one more game to go for 12-0 and it is the Old Oaken Bucket Game. IU has a chance to recover both physically and mentally before heading to West Lafayette on Black Friday. Anything can happen if a rivalry game…Just ask Ohio State.",https://i0.wp.com/hoosierhuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/USATSI_27594273-e1763305811808.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 13:02:22.516989

November 16, 2025 - OAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Friday joined a coalition of 22 attorneys general and two states in filing a motion for a preliminary injunction to ensure that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) preserves funding for the Solar for All federal grant program while litigation is pending. In August, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would terminate the Solar for All program, asserting the agency no longer had statutory authority to administer the funds. Administrator Zeldin’s directive terminated nearly $250 million in funds owed to California, where state agencies were preparing to build out community solar and associated clean energy projects. In October, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition challenged the Trump Administration in a pair of lawsuits over the unlawful termination of this funding. In today’s motion, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the coalition asks the District Court to freeze congressionally appropriated Solar for All funds — including both the funds still in the states’ accounts and the funds already taken out — so that the Court can restore the program later if the coalition is ultimately successful in their litigation. A preliminary injunction will ensure that the funds are protected from being moved outside of EPA, where they could become unrecoverable.

“Without the District Court’s intervention, states including California will experience irreparable harm from the EPA’s actions,” said Attorney General Bonta. “That’s why we, alongside a broad coalition of attorneys general, are filing this motion to protect funding for the Solar for All program—a nationwide program that promises to address climate change, stimulate the economy, and promote energy independence and grid reliability, while also lowering energy costs.”

In 2022, Congress appropriated $7 billion to EPA through the Inflation Reduction Act specifically to develop competitive grant programs to expand solar energy access nationwide. EPA designed the Solar for All program to provide financial and technical assistance for the deployment of zero-emission technology, including residential and distributed solar to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in low-income and disadvantaged communities. EPA issued 60 competitive awards in 2024 to states, municipalities, and non-profit organizations, ranging from $43.5 million to almost $250 million per recipient.

In their motion, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition argue that:

The states are likely to prevail in their claims that the Trump Administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and congressional mandates.

The states will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief prohibiting EPA from de-obligating and reprogramming Solar for All funding. In California, state agencies were expecting to receive almost $250 million, including more than $200 million to build out community solar systems, which would enable California residents to obtain 20% monthly discounts on electricity bills in exchange for participating in the Solar for All program—primarily aimed at lower- and middle-income families. The funding also included $9 million for workforce training—enabling more California workers to acquire skills needed to help build a sustainable future.

The irreparable harms that would flow from EPA’s decision to move the Solar for All funds outside of the agency overwhelmingly favor preliminary injunctive relief.

In filing today’s motion for a preliminary injunction, Attorney General Bonta joins the attorneys general of Arizona, Washington, Minnesota, the District of Columbia, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

The project will enable Spain to become a regional leader in the production of renewable hydrogen, which has become the trendy option for the renewable energy sector.

Repsol’s industrial complex in Cartagena is set for a massive electrolyzer to be installed

Repsol is the largest producer of renewable hydrogen in Spain, but is also the largest consumer of the renewable energy resource. In a move that accelerates Spain’s energy transition ambitions, the company has given the go-ahead for a 100 MW electrolyzer to be built and installed at its industrial complex in the East of Spain.

The electrolyzer will be capable of producing approximately 15,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually, and has the added benefit of avoiding emissions of up to 167,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. If that wasn’t enough to get the excitement brewing, the Cartagena electrolyzer has been selected by the European Commission as a strategic project of common European interest, which means it can rely on substantial funding from the EU as well.

Repsol aims to replace conventional hydrogen with renewable hydrogen at its industrial sites

The company has outlined its plans to completely replace the conventional hydrogen at its industrial sites across Spain with the all-new clean and renewable hydrogen that the electrolyzer produces. This would mark a significant step in changing the roadmap for Spain’s energy future as the nation aims to lean on the renewable energy sector over the next decade.

The project will receive €155 million from the Spanish government authorities

The fact that the project aligns with EU and Spanish clean energy goals, and that it has been designated as strategically important for the European Union, means that the Spanish Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE) will allocate up to €155 million for the project. That is on top of the already substantial investment made by Repsol and Enagas, which holds a 25% stake in the project.

The new electrolyzer will help Spain avoid significant emissions that exceed the current levels avoided by the entire EV sector in the nation, which is saying a lot, as Spain has embraced the emission-cutting benefits of the EV sector. Securing financing from the EU can be seen as a milestone for any project, as the EU does not take its role in the global energy transition lightly. As evidenced by the recent news that it will back a Baltic Sea hydrogen project.

“The plant is expected to be operational in 2029, representing a milestone for the Hydrogen Valley of the Region of Murcia, one of Spain’s most important regional initiatives. The goal is to create the most efficient ecosystem possible, aligning production capacity with the needs of industry. The project also includes the possibility that, in the future, the renewable hydrogen can be fed into the natural gas network and the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone.” – Repsol press release

This seems impossible, but the cooperation between Volkswagen Group and Rivian to develop software for electric vehicles is going so well that the two companies are thinking they could market their digital expertise to other automakers. Is this the same Volkswagen that has floundered for nearly a decade to get its software to work properly? The same company that created CARIAD, a new software division, then fired all the senior executives and started over from scratch before finally throwing in the towel and outsourcing the task to Rivian? That Volkswagen?

The answer, according to the Detroit News, is “Yes!” It reports that the joint venture created by Volkswagen and Rivian — known as RV Tech — has made great progress toward delivering the EV electrical and software platform that Volkswagen Group needs to compete with Tesla and Chinese automakers.

RV Tech is focused on delivering software systems for Rivian and Volkswagen, but is open to talking to third parties about using those platforms, which are designed to be scalable across vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets.

“We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry,” Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair, told journalists at an event in Palo Alto, California, on November 12, 2025. “That could become an opportunity” for others as well, he said. “There’s no Rivian versus VW versus Audi. It’s Rivian, and Audi, and VW, and potentially in the future other OEMs because of the breadth and scalability of the technology solution that we’re building.”

RV Tech Sees Licensing Opportunities

The earning potential from licensing the technology “is a very different ballgame and a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars,” Bensaid said. RV Tech also said it will begin testing the system soon in winter conditions on Audi, Volkswagen, and Scout models, starting in the first quarter of 2026.

Volkswagen is grappling with tariffs in the US, shrinking deliveries in China, and muted demand in Europe. As part of its push to cut costs and bolster sales, it has turned to Rivian for the kind of software and EV technology its initial battery-powered models were missing. The automaker is investing as much as $5.8 billion in the alliance, making it one of Volkswagen Group’s biggest strategic bets ever.

Two months ago, Germany’s Manager Magazin reported that the relationship between Rivian and Volkswagen is experiencing some turbulence. “Volkswagen is reportedly encountering extensive problems in its partnership with Rivian. As a result, electric models intended to run on Rivian software are apparently delayed. Furthermore, Rivian’s algorithms cannot simply be transferred to internal combustion engines, which Volkswagen now seems likely to keep in the line-up for longer,” it wrote.

Highly placed sources said Audi’s Q8 e-tron SUV and A4 e-tron may be delayed by at least a year, moving their launch date back to mid or late 2028. The debut of Porsche’s K1 SUV, which is supposed to be a battery electric model positioned above the Cayenne due in showrooms by late 2027, is now postponed indefinitely.

There was even a suggestion in that report that CARIAD, bloodied and bruised by constant corporate infighting and upheavals, might be resurrected, as Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume tries to find someone — anyone — who can solve the company’s ongoing software issues.

Zonal Architecture

When the joint venture was created a year ago, it brought together software developers and engineers from both companies. Like Tesla, BYD, and Xiaomi, RV Tech is using zonal architecture which requires fewer individual controllers to oversee a wider range of functions in the car’s front, central, and rear sections, thus reducing costs for both companies. For Rivian, which has yet to become profitable, the investment from Volkswagen Group is a financial lifeline as demand for electric vehicles softens for a number of policy reasons.

While RV Tech is putting a priority on ramping up and delivering software platforms for electric models, there are parallels that would allow the technology to be used for combustion engine cars as well, co-chair Carsten Helbing told the press last week.

Rivian R2 First Up

The first vehicle to use the new technology will be the R2 sport utility vehicle from Rivian that’s expected to debut in the first quarter of 2026. The first Volkswagen product to use it will be the ID.1 that is on track to appear in 2027. That compact EV is expected to sell for about €20,000 ($23,000) in Europe, where it will compete with the new battery electric Twingo from Renault and a number of low-cost models from Chinese manufacturers.

After the ID.1 goes on sale, the next vehicles from Volkswagen to use the software package from RV Tech will be the new pickup truck and SUV from Scout Motors, perhaps in 2028. Those vehicles were intended to be battery electrics until the Moron of Mar-A-Loco blew into town and snuffed out every forward-leaning program in existence in the US. That caused Volkswagen to rethink its sales strategy and add plug-in hybrid powertrains to the Scout mix.

It could have been worse. The German company could have revived its turbo diesel powertrains for its Scout models. The question now is whether those plug-in hybrids will have wimpy little batteries that condemn the vehicles to relying on their internal combustion engines most of the time, or whether they will have enough battery-only range to qualify as true PHEVs that use the electric motor primarily and keep the gas engine in reserve for occasional use.

There is no suggestion in the current reporting that the disruptions Manager Magazin reported are holding up progress. Apparently, the software platform is now capable of supporting at least plug-in hybrid architecture, which could be a big plus for the joint venture as it explores the possibility of marketing its software to other companies. Plug-in hybrids are the new darlings of the automotive world, as enthusiasm for battery-powered cars cools.

Volkswagen’s earlier efforts to develop software in-house largely stumbled, first by holding up launches of its namesake brand’s ID models, then by handicapping sales of those vehicles because of buggy features. Volkswagen Group, which also includes Audi and Porsche and a handful of other brands, has seen EV sales rise in Europe this year after improving software and updating models, Bloomberg says.

Software-defined vehicles are relatively new to the world of automobiles, and many legacy automakers are finding it hard to incorporate digital systems into their cars. Volkswagen has been out in left field now for almost a decade. Has it finally turned the corner and gotten on a path that could see it selling software systems to other manufacturers? That would be quite a turnaround indeed.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RV-Tech.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 11:05:09.397297

The Hindu reached out to the Environment Ministry for more clarity on the country platform but did not receive a comment until press time.
The new initiative will be guided by a steering committee with a majority of representatives from developing countries.","India was among 13 countries and a regional alliance of African countries that announced plans to set up a national platform for “climate and nature finance” at a ministerial event during COP30 underway in Belem, Brazil, on Saturday (November 15, 2025). This would be coordinated through the Green Climate Fund (GCF), an institutional mechanism that has been at work since 2015, to fund projects in developing countries to adapt to unfolding climate change as well as to invest in clean energy.

Despite being the world’s largest institutional mechanism for disbursing funds for climate finance, with commitments worth $19 billion, only a quarter of it has been properly allocated as of 2024. The GCF faces criticism from developing countries that its disbursal mechanisms are often difficult to comply with and there is limited technical support to avail these funds.

A stated goal of the GCF is to ensure that its funds are evenly split between adaptation and mitigation.

The Belem ministerial event, co-hosted by Brazil’s Ministry of Finance and the GCF, brought together ministers and other senior government officials as well as international, national, public, and private climate finance leaders.

Away from ‘fragmented approach’

While India already engages with the GCF, it is believed that a new ‘country platform’ for “climate and nature finance” would help the country move away from a “fragmented approach” towards accessing funds. This is especially significant in a year when calls from developing countries for prioritising adaptation and improving access to climate finance are particularly resonant, especially at the ongoing proceedings of COP30. The Hindu reached out to the Environment Ministry for more clarity on the country platform but did not receive a comment until press time.

Halfway through negotiations on Saturday (November 15, 2025), India was leading developing countries’ clamour for a focussed discussion and roadmap on a section of the Paris Agreement called Article 9.1 that mandates developed countries provide funds for mitigation and adaptation.

The announcement of such a platform also ties in with expectations that negotiators may finalise a list of indicators that can be used to measure progress towards the so-called Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). Progress on producing an agreed list of indicators has been difficult, with nearly 90 experts working over two years to narrow down a list of almost 10,000 potential indicators to a final set of just 100, which is supposed to be adopted at COP30, according to a report by Molly Lempriere, an analyst for Carbon Brief, an agency that tracks climate negotiations.

However, with India, among other countries expected to announce National Adaptation Plans, there is greater vocal support and interest in having a concrete outcome on the GGA.

GCF’s India commitments

Announcing their country and regional platforms, representatives from the African Islands States Climate Commission (AISCC), Cambodia, Colombia, India, Kazakhstan, Lesotho, Mongolia, Nigeria, Oman, Panama, Rwanda, the Dominican Republic, Togo, and South Africa shared their vision and strategies for leveraging country platforms to accelerate climate action. This brings the number of platforms to 16, with the previously established Brazil Country Platform and Caribbean Regional Platform, according to a note from the GCF.

As of August 2024, India has received commitment from the GCF for 11 projects/programmes worth $782 million to mitigate and adapt to climate change in sectors, including water, clean energy, coastal, livelihood, transport, medium and small enterprises and climate start-ups. A bulk of the financing is in the form of concessional loans.

India’s Environment Ministry is the primary access point (or the Nodal Designated Authority) for GCF-linked funding. While being a recipient of funds, it has sought expertise in being able to equip State governments and private entities in the country to be able to effectively engage with the NDA and the GCF to access these funds.

The new initiative will be guided by a steering committee with a majority of representatives from developing countries. Organisationally, the Country Platforms Hub will operate through a lean secretariat, supported by the Africa Climate Foundation (ACF) during its incubation period. Initial funding amounts to nearly $4 million and will support early activities, including governance, coordination, knowledge sharing, and a spark plug window for designing early-stage national platforms.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3r0k8y/article70287617.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/cop30%20climate%20finance.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:42.762148

The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.
United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.
Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.
“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren’t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action — on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more — including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Decision time

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad as it could be.”

Momentum to phase out fossil fuels

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Getting Indigenous voices heard

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

Second, that Canada would hit the government’s industrial greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

Third, that most Canadian households would be financially better off as a result.

To the contrary, a recent study by the fiscally conservative Fraser Institute estimates that over the past decade, the federal, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and B.C. governments have spent or foregone revenues of $158 billion in inflation-adjusted 2024 dollars to create a mere 68,000 “clean energy” jobs.

That’s an estimated cost of $2.3 million per job.

GOLDSTEIN: Carney’s budget won’t fix decade of Trudeau’s economic mismanagement

“Governments, activists and special interests groups have been making a lot of claims about the opportunities of a clean economic transition, but after a decade of policy interventions and more than $150 billion in taxpayers’ money, the results are underwhelming,” said Elmira Aliakbari, co-author of the study titled The Fiscal Cost of Canada’s Low-Carbon Economy.

A second Fraser Institute study – Sizing Canada’s Clean Economy – concluded that after almost a decade of federal and provincial governments funnelling billions of dollars into the “clean economy” from 2014 to 2023, its percentage of Canada’s total economy of $3.3 trillion barely moved from 3.1% of GDP to 3.6%.

Yes

No

As for meeting federal emission targets, the Canadian Climate Institute and the Trottier Energy Institute at Polytechnique Montreal recently concluded the Liberals’ target of reducing Canada’s emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels in 2030 is out of reach and that the government will achieve, at best, half of that.

The parliamentary budget office – a watchdog on federal spending – reported that before Carney cancelled the consumer carbon tax, most Canadian families were in fact paying more in carbon taxes than they received in rebates, when factoring in the negative impact of the carbon tax on the Canadian economy.

During the last election, Carney promised to replace the consumer carbon tax with an “improved and tightened” industrial carbon tax that would benefit both consumers and businesses. But his recent budget, while containing nine pages about his so-called climate competitiveness strategy, had no specifics on how it will work.

Call it a myth in the making.

Economic Impact: Jobs, Local Spending, and $32 Million in Tax Revenue

The Lafitte Solar project is projected to deliver long-term benefits for Ouachita Parish and the Monroe region. Over the course of its operations, it is expected to generate approximately $32 million in regional tax revenue, supporting key public services such as:

Local schools

Law enforcement

Emergency services

Community infrastructure

During peak construction, the project supported 150+ full-time jobs, many of which were filled by local workers. Crews partnered with RWE’s EPC contractor, McCarthy Building Companies, whose teams contributed to local spending by patronizing restaurants, shops, and service businesses throughout the parish.

Joe Holyfield, President of the Ouachita Industrial Development Board, emphasized the project’s immediate economic value:

""Lafitte Solar brought jobs and investment to Ouachita Parish at a crucial time. Our local businesses felt an immediate benefit, and we look forward to sustained growth as energy projects like these strengthen our region's future.""

Meta also applauded the milestone, underscoring the project’s dual benefits of economic growth and clean energy adoption.

Amanda Yang, Head of Clean and Renewable Energy at Meta, said:

""We're thrilled to see the Lafitte Solar project reach this important milestone — not only adding clean energy to the grid locally but adding jobs to the local economy. Projects like Lafitte Solar are essential to achieving our clean energy goals while strengthening communities.""

These investments were designed to support families, expand youth recreation access, and improve quality of life across Ouachita Parish—highlighting RWE’s long-term commitment to local partnerships, not just project construction.

Sustainable Land Use and Agrivoltaics: A Dual-Purpose Model

Lafitte Solar has also been designed to support Louisiana’s agricultural landscape through a combination of biodiversity initiatives and agrivoltaic practices.

Key features include:

Native and natural vegetation planted around the project perimeter to protect local habitats

Collaboration with Louisiana farmers to introduce a flock of 600+ sheep for vegetation management

Preservation of surrounding farmlands through low-impact land use practices

This dual-purpose agricultural–solar model reduces the need for mechanical mowing, supports local livestock operations, and enhances soil health. It also demonstrates how renewable energy projects can function in harmony with Louisiana’s farming culture—an increasingly important approach as the state balances economic development with environmental protection.

Why This Project Matters for Louisiana’s Energy Future

Lafitte Solar arrives at a critical moment for Louisiana, a state historically dependent on natural gas and petrochemical industries. The project:

Diversifies the state’s power mix

Contributes to resilience as regions adopt more grid-stabilizing renewables

Attracts large corporate buyers like Meta that seek renewable power for operations

Strengthens rural economic development through infrastructure and job creation

For RWE, this project is part of a broader push across the United States, where the company is now the third largest renewable energy developer with more than 2,000 employees and over 10 gigawatts of operating wind, solar, and storage projects.

RWE’s U.S. strategy also supports domestic manufacturing growth and American energy independence through investments in local supply chains and long-term infrastructure.",,N,,2025-11-16 12:03:23.203560

New discoveries, seismic surveys and growing international interest point toward opportunities that could ease the country’s reliance on imports and enhance long-term energy security. At the same time, policymakers and industry leaders are exploring ways to channel investment into local resources while cultivating global partnerships to unlock this promise.

Rising domestic reserves: A glimpse of self-reliance

As of December 2024, Pakistan’s proven oil reserves stood at approximately 238 million barrels, representing a 23% increase from around 193 million barrels in December 2023. This growth, though modest in global terms, underscores the country’s latent potential and highlights the importance of sustained investment in domestic exploration. Despite this encouraging rise, domestic production still falls short of meeting national demand, keeping Pakistan reliant on imports to fuel its industries, transport and households.

The scale of this reliance is significant. In the fiscal year 2023–2024, Pakistan’s petroleum import bill reached $15.1 billion, according to the State Bank of Pakistan, while some sources reported a slightly higher figure of $16.9 billion.

This consistent outflow of foreign exchange underscores the importance of developing local reserves as a top priority. Every barrel produced domestically represents not just a saving in import costs, but also a step towards greater national resilience.

Shale energy: Pakistan’s untapped frontier

Beyond conventional oil and gas, Pakistan is among the world’s most promising nations in terms of shale energy potential. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Pakistan may hold up to nine billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil and around 105 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. These resources, largely concentrated in the Sembar and Ranikot formations of the Lower Indus Basin, could transform Pakistan’s energy profile if developed successfully.

It is important to note, however, that these remain geological assessments rather than proven reserves. Unlocking them would require extensive drilling, advanced technologies and a carefully phased development strategy. Industry estimates suggest that an initial investment of $5 billion or more, along with several years of effort, would be necessary before commercial-scale extraction becomes feasible.

Yet, this challenge also represents an opportunity. Pakistan has the chance to build partnerships with technologically advanced nations and multinational energy firms that can bring the expertise, capital and innovation needed to realize these resources. By positioning itself as an attractive investment destination, Pakistan could set the stage for a major transformation in its energy sector.

The Pakistan-US investment relationship holds untapped strategic value, particularly in critical sectors like minerals, energy, information technology (IT) and agriculture. Pakistan’s mineral reserves, valued between $6–8 trillion, including copper, lithium and rare earths, offer a strategic edge. These resources are crucial for the US clean energy transition and technological security.

The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has been a pivotal enabler in streamlining procedures and boosting investment, especially in sectors like renewables and mining. US foreign direct investment (FDI) in Pakistan remains underutilized, with further engagement in energy development and mineral extraction critical for both countries’ long-term economic interests.

Offshore exploration: the next energy frontier

Momentum is also being built offshore. In early 2024, a multi-year seismic survey was conducted in the offshore Indus Basin, which detected promising subsurface structures containing hydrocarbons.

While still at an early stage, these findings suggest that Pakistan’s coastal regions may hold the key to future discoveries. Successful offshore exploration would not only diversify the energy mix but also elevate Pakistan’s status as a serious player in the global energy market.

These initiatives underline the fact that Pakistan is far from resource-poor; rather, it is a nation on the cusp of converting geological promise into economic strength. With the right strategies and partnerships, it could unlock reserves that support industrial growth, create jobs and stabilize its balance of payments.

Energy development cannot be viewed in isolation; it is deeply tied to Pakistan’s international partnerships. Since its independence in 1947, Pakistan’s relationship with the United States has been shaped by both geopolitical shifts and enduring economic cooperation. Despite ups and downs, the trade and investment relationship has proven resilient, with the US consistently ranking among Pakistan’s largest trading partners.

Today, the United States is not only Pakistan’s largest export market, accounting for about 17% of total exports, but also a leading source of foreign direct investment. US companies have been active in consumer goods, information and communications technology (ICT), renewable energy and financial services, bringing global expertise and creating local opportunities. Pakistan, in turn, has exported textiles, apparel and a growing range of goods to the US, cementing the bilateral trade corridor as one of the most important in South Asia.

The momentum has accelerated further in recent months. In July–August 2025, high-level talks culminated in a new trade agreement aimed at developing Pakistan’s oil reserves and reducing bilateral tariffs. The accord promises not only to deepen cooperation in hydrocarbons but also to expand market access for Pakistani exports.

US President Donald Trump even suggested that future exploration could position Pakistan as an energy exporter to regional markets such as India — an ambitious but symbolic indicator of Pakistan’s potential.

Toward an energy-independent future

Pakistan’s energy challenge is undeniable, but so too is its potential. Rising proven reserves, significant shale prospects and encouraging offshore surveys highlight a future that could be shaped by reform, innovation and foreign investment.

For partners like the United States, deeper engagement in Pakistan’s energy sector is not only an economic opportunity but also a strategic investment in regional stability. If managed wisely, Pakistan could move from chronic dependency toward becoming a more resilient, self-sufficient player in the global energy landscape.

Experts highlighted legal gaps that allow agricultural runoff and waste from large farms to go largely unregulated.

Speakers suggested tying conservation requirements to farm subsidies, as voluntary programs have proven insufficient.

More than 60 people attended a town hall at Drake University's Meredith Hall to discuss ways in which the debate regarding statewide water concerns can be geared toward producing solutions.

The event, held Saturday, Nov. 15, was a follow-up to an August meeting during which hundreds watched the first presentation of a landmark, $1 million Polk County report that tied agricultural practices to widespread water pollution.

The report came at a time when the local water supplies were so contaminated with nitrates tied to farm runoff that Central Iowa Water Works had issued a temporary ban on lawn watering ―the first ever in the region ― to keep water demand from outstripping treatment capacity.

Here are three key focuses that arose from Saturday’s town hall.

An encore presentation in Iowa City in late October drew more than 200 people.

“After all of these presentations, after that really excellent report, there's a common question that we keep getting, and that question is, ‘What would we do about it?’” said Adam Shriver, director of wellness and nutrition policy at the Harkin Institute, a public policy research nonprofit at Drake that hosted the initial presentation. “That question is really what we want to start to answer today.”

Historically, the state of Iowa has declined to impose any mandatory measures on farmers to reduce runoff, instead relying on voluntary programs. A federal court dismissed a 2017 lawsuit filed by Des Moines Water Works seeking to force regulation in northwest Iowa water districts.

Gov. Kim Reynolds, questioned about the Polk County report in July, said “regulation is hardly ever the answer.” The Trump administration in August pulled the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency list of Iowa waterways in need of pollution reduction measures. And the state has moved to eliminate a system for monitoring Iowa waters for pollutants, although local entities led by Polk County have allocated funds to keep the University of Iowa-operated initiative active.

Speakers and organizers from Food & Water Watch, Progress Iowa, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and the Harkin Institute led discussions Saturday on potential responses to nitrate contamination, pesticide use, factory farm impacts and gaps in state water oversight.

“We know about the challenges that we're facing for our water and our health, and what seems sometimes like a lack of motivation among some of our leaders to do much about those problems,” Shriver said. “But it's also a moment where the problems have become too big to ignore.”

Closing the legal gaps that keep ag water pollution unregulated

A recurring theme during the town hall was policy gaps that allow pollution from agricultural operations to go largely unchecked.

Michael Schmidt, general counsel for the Iowa Environmental Council, said that when water quality fails to meet required standards, officials are typically tasked with determining what level of pollution is unacceptable and identifying any major point-source contributors. Those often include factories and sewage treatment plants.

Current policy, though, does not assign limits to nonpoint sources, including agricultural runoff, leaving them effectively outside regulation.

Schmidt pointed to the state’s oversight of concentrated animal feeding operations as an example of how that gap plays out.

He said the state relies on a scoring system called the master matrix that lets such facilities be built if operators can prove they can keep manure discharge below a maximum threshold.

That framework, he said, has not kept pace with the scale of modern operations. Some egg operations in Iowa, for instance, can house millions of hens, but few such facilities are under permits that would allow regulation of their waste discharges.

“We’ve had in a 10-year period, close to 400 manure releases and at any given time, we have fewer than 200 of these that have a clean water active"" permit, Schmidt said

In Iowa, the cost of polluting the state’s waterways is surprisingly low, he added. The median penalty for manure releases is about $3,000, he said.

“So if you have a few thousand animals and incur one penalty, because you don’t get caught very often, $3,000 is just the cost of doing business,” Schmidt said.

Requirements tied to incentives, not voluntary programs

Speakers also addressed how Iowa’s current reliance on voluntary conservation has not yielded meaningful, sustained reductions in nutrient pollution.

“We have been attempting voluntary conservation practices since 1935, plus-90 years ago,” Schmidt said.

He said pressures that deter voluntary compliance are reinforced by incentives built into existing farm programs.

“Economically, we are paying people to maximize production,” Schmidt said, adding that taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance and commodity supports have encouraged large-scale production instead of diversification of crops to embrace ones less dependent on nitrate fertilizers.

He pointed to the 1985 farm bill as an example of when tying requirements to subsidies produced noticeable change.

“We decided we are going to condition the receipt of these subsidies on not filling wetlands,” he said, calling it evidence of what happens when conservation is mandatory rather than optional.

Schmidt said progress under Iowa’s voluntary approach remains far too slow.

“We are making some progress,” he said, “but it will take several thousand years.”

Generating grassroots pressure and involvement

John Norris, a lawyer at the Horizon Group, a marketing research and management consultant company that works to encourage effective changes, said the push for better water quality will depend on whether Iowans treat it as a priority.

Norris, who was Polk County administrator when the water report was commissioned, said the reason for it was to increase the knowledge of Iowans about the state of Iowa's water quality. His hope, he said, is that candidate's stances on water quality and environmental issues will become key factors in voting outcomes.

Norris said he believes long-term gains require policy changes, not just improved awareness.

“It’s going to be a change in policies that get us out of this,” he said.

He said those shifts have come with their share of resistance.

“When you have a change in policy, the politics of that are we are threatening the power of people who are benefiting from this policy, and then you get into money and politics and power,” he said.

He said the Horizon Group has begun collaborating with researchers to identify what Iowa’s monitoring and data systems should look like. He said any policy shift must also consider farmers’ position in the current system.

“We’re cautious not to just throw farmers on the bus here,” he said. “They have farmed the way that they have been required to farm to stay in business. We’ve got to change that for them.”

Schmidt said he’s seen similar public momentum across the state, adding, ""This really is something that extends far beyond our region, and I think is a moment in Iowa’s history where people are very much ready for change.”

He said he believes progress will depend on involvement from multiple fronts.

“Ultimately, change is going to have to come from many different types of efforts that are all moving towards a common goal,” he said. “What today is about is recognizing the importance of grassroots efforts and the work that can be done by people in this group.”","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/15/PDEM/85218748007-071525-icon-water-trails-groundbreaking-ls-10.jpg?crop=8639,4861,x0,y449&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-16 11:04:58.355029

Discussions will explore nature-positive urban planning, resilient plant production, water resource management, biodiversity restoration, climate-adaptive landscaping, and the integration of biophilic and circular design principles into the built environment. Specialists will also address how intelligent irrigation systems, native species cultivation and interconnected green corridors can transform cities into cooler, healthier and more liveable spaces.

The strong engagement from government bodies, research institutions and international stakeholders reinforces the importance of Myplant & Garden Middle East as a platform guiding future policy, institutional collaboration and investment in green infrastructure. The insights shared throughout the event reflect a growing regional commitment to integrating sustainable landscaping, public gardens and biodiversity-rich public spaces into major real-estate, tourism and urban development projects.

Valeria Randazzo, Exhibition Director of Myplant & Garden Middle East, noted that the conversations taking place during the exhibition will play a key role in shaping the trajectory of the region’s cities. “Green spaces are an essential component of a future-ready city. This exhibition brings global expertise and regional ambition together, accelerating pathways towards sustainable horticulture, advanced irrigation solutions and resilient landscape design. These conversations will shape the development of greener cities throughout the Middle East,” she said.

Day One concluded with a strong emphasis on the need to reimagine urban environments as nature-positive and climate-resilient spaces that support both environmental health and human wellbeing. Discussions highlighted how outdoor environments influence real-estate value, community cohesion and long-term sustainability, while also acknowledging the growing demand for greener developments across the GCC.

With its robust international participation, comprehensive technical agenda and the endorsement of leading government authorities, Myplant & Garden Middle East 2025 stands as a landmark event for the regional horticulture and landscaping sector. It sets the foundation for reshaping Middle Eastern cities into sustainable, biodiverse ecosystems that advance public wellbeing, drive investment and strengthen climate resilience for generations to come.

Doing so with renewable energy — along with so-called firming technologies — would be a cheaper option than maintaining the status quo, she said.
""Yes, renewable energy, once it is built and operational, is one of the lowest-cost sources of energy.
""This is the primary driver of new investment across the system, Ms van den Berg said.
""The most cost-effective and cleanest way to replace retiring coal plants remains renewables and storage, supported by gas for firming.""","Australia's energy chiefs have warned against the country turning away from its net zero ambitions, but cautioned that electricity prices are unlikely to fall for at least a decade.

In a survey of the bosses running the country's major energy companies, the Australian Energy Council found many were worried that unavoidable costs were yet to sheet home to consumers.

The council represents major power companies including AGL, Origin and Energy Australia.

Another told surveyors that costs for network poles and wires in particular were set to ""go up and go up by increasing levels"".

""And the Australian consumer is not really wise to that yet because they haven't seen the worst of it,"" the CEO noted.

Part of the cost of electricity comes from generating it, and increased renewables in Australia's electricity system have recently put downward pressure on electricity prices.

But the cost of delivering this electricity through maintaining and upgrading the electricity network has been increasing.

'Too late' to turn back

Despite these costs, many chief executives warned abandoning the energy transition was untenable given the ageing and increasingly unreliable nature of coal plants that had long formed the mainstay of the electricity system.

And they argued that renewable energy — backed by batteries, gas plants and pumped hydro — was still the ""least-cost"" way of replacing that coal.

""It's about making sure that we get the right assets on the ground in time for coal closure, in a nutshell,"" said one boss.

The release of the survey follows a tumultuous week in Canberra in which the opposition Liberal Party junked its support for net zero by 2050.

Louisa Kinnear, who runs the council, said her members ""understood the urgency of climate change and the role of the energy industry in meeting our emissions ambitions.""

She echoed their comments, particularly that many of Australia's coal-fired power stations were coming towards the end of their useful life and would soon need replacing anyway.

Doing so with renewable energy — along with so-called firming technologies — would be a cheaper option than maintaining the status quo, she said.

""The AEC supports the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 on the premise that the least-cost, lowest-impact pathway is an energy system dominated by renewables,"" Ms Kinnear said.

The CSIRO and international energy experts have consistently found that renewable energy supported by storage is the cheapest form of new power, a view backed up last week by the International Energy Agency, which found a scenario in which countries pushed for net zero by 2050 would leave consumers better off than a slower transition.

However, Ms Kinnear stressed that significant costs would be incurred in building new generation capacity, expanded transmission and distribution lines and back-up kit that would be required to support all of it.

Costs up 'for at least a decade'

Ms Kinnear said this would ultimately have an effect on consumers' bills.

And she said ensuring electricity remained affordable was a central challenge.

""We need to ensure that clean, affordable energy remains accessible to everyone during the transition,"" she said.

""Replacing ageing, emissions-intensive generation with predominantly renewable energy is not costless.

""Yes, renewable energy, once it is built and operational, is one of the lowest-cost sources of energy.

""But we still need to account for the costs of constructing new supply and adapting our existing energy system to accommodate and firm up low-emissions intermittent sources.""

Some chief executives, who were able to provide their comments anonymously, were more direct.

According to one, the ""most urgent issue, I think, is addressing affordability"".

Another said: ""The biggest risk to this whole transition is that the general public haven't really cottoned on to the fact that there's a cost to the transition, and power bills will go up for a while before they go down.""

Others worried the difficulties facing the transition, which have included ballooning construction costs, localised opposition to projects and a fractious political climate, were a serious risk to its progress.

There were also concerns that delays to the construction of new transmission lines and the large-scale wind and solar farms that depended on them would have knock-on effects for existing fossil fuel plants.

Some CEOs, the council noted, ""believe it is becoming increasingly inevitable that coal closures may need to be delayed”, risking increased unreliability, and often an injection of taxpayer funds for plants to stay open past their planned closure dates.

""The transition right now is delicately poised and at quite an important point,"" the head of a generation and retail company said.

""There have been these bumps along the way, it is taking longer to deliver the new generation and transmission projects [and] transmission is obviously a critical path.""

Energy Networks Australia, the lobby group which represents poles and wires companies, said attributing cost pressures in electricity supply to transmission projects was an oversimplification.

CEO Dominique van den Berg said there were lots of reasons prices in energy supply chains were rising, from interest rates to surging demand for labour and materials.

Ms van den Berg also pointed out that replacing ageing infrastructure was ""no longer optional"", it was ""essential"".

""This is the primary driver of new investment across the system, Ms van den Berg said.

""Even in this environment, transmission lines are still a relatively small share of a household bill.

""The most cost-effective and cleanest way to replace retiring coal plants remains renewables and storage, supported by gas for firming.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5cfcd68ec37320dd207cbbbfcb82c53a?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=261&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-16 11:04:33.817341

The law was in full effect, mandating monitoring and handling of landfills, when the EPA conducted its Superfund site inspection in 1993.","Rain fell freely on Casper Riordan without a tree canopy to temper it.

In a clearing between the urban forests of Alton Baker Park and Eastgate Woodlands, he led a small crew of volunteers working within a tight radius marked by bright neon flags — the boundary of their restoration project.

It’s a tough place for Riordan, a stewardship coordinator with the Walama Restoration Project, to find the right plants for. Inside this nearly 2-mile loop of Pre’s Trail is the 70-acre decommissioned Day Island Landfill. About 2 feet of soil — the landfill’s cap — lie between a decade’s worth of garbage and the native species he is trying to grow.

The soil is too shallow for the roots of big trees to take hold, and so plants must endure full sun in the heat of summer. But they also have to be able to live in soft, waterlogged ground when rain returns each fall, as it had begun to do this October Sunday.

“It gets pretty wet down there. That’s more of a wet meadow,” said Riordan, referencing an area near the Interstate 5 bridge. “[There are] pools of water.”

Such pools are typically a natural part of the southern Willamette Valley’s wetlands. But here, some water may be rising from beneath an estimated 950,000 tons of buried solid waste.

Lookout Eugene-Springfield’s initial investigation into the Day Island Landfill identified a roughly 200-square-foot chemical disposal area, about the size of a small garage, that took in toxic waste from J.H. Baxter & Co. — the west Eugene wood-treatment company whose facility is now a Superfund cleanup site.

The Environmental Protection Agency, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and Lane County either have not monitored the landfill site for decades or can’t find records of such work since the early 1990s. They say they have no plans to resume the monitoring.

Government agencies pointed to the landfill’s cap as the protection against human exposure to what lies beneath. They also cited the 1993 decision not to designate the property as a Superfund site, which they said removed federal oversight of follow-up actions or other requirements.

But records stored for years in Washington, D.C., archives — and released to Lookout by the EPA, through the Freedom of Information Act — describe a complex situation.

The records detail contaminants have broken through the surface and that some may be leaking into a pond near the Willamette River, south of a monitoring well where chemicals used by J.H. Baxter were detected.

These records, including photographs, show a water-saturated landfill during the rainy months.

Landfill caps typically include an impermeable liner, none of which is noted in records. Instead, those records describe groundwater moving easily through loose, sandy soil and becoming trapped beneath the cap, forcing water to seep.

What pushes through likely contains leachate, the contaminated water that filters through decaying waste. Records contain photos of standing water, some of which displays an oily sheen with orange or reddish-brown clay.

After recent atmospheric rivers this fall, puddles have lingered for days, their contents unknown, alongside a nearby pond showing similar discoloration as the records described decades ago.

These records also outline the EPA’s rationale for not listing the landfill as a Superfund site. But in a decision memo, the site’s lead investigator, Deborah Flood, did not dismiss concerns. She wrote:

“Information collected identifies (Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality) as an active authority on the site … The site does have environmental problems associated with it; however, it does not qualify for further Superfund evaluation.”

Superfund sites represent only the most extreme contamination cases. Fewer than 1% of known toxic sites in the country qualify. Many hazardous sites fall below that threshold, and this landfill was one of those.

A ‘secondary’ Superfund site

In 1991, then-U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio wrote to the EPA on behalf of a constituent.

“[They are] concerned about the proposed construction of a golf course on a closed Lane County Landfill that is currently listed on the EPA’s secondary list of Superfund sites,” DeFazio wrote in a memo.

“Secondary” is not a formal EPA term, but it can refer to a site listed for investigation under the Superfund law, as the Day Island Landfill was in 1979. The EPA became involved after allegations that Monsanto Co., the maker of Roundup, dumped waste there.

In response to DeFazio’s letter, an EPA administrator outlined the situation, saying the agency found contaminants beneath surface soil and surface water and planned to score the site under a new ranking system.

In 1993, the site received a score of 25.09, below the 28.5 threshold required for Superfund designation. By comparison, the J.H. Baxter wood-treatment plant in west Eugene scored 31.7 and received its Superfund designation earlier this year. The scorecard considers how close people live to a site, but it does not account for heavy public use of surrounding parkland, focusing instead on residential proximity.

A 1992 study commissioned by Oregon’s DEQ, which helped inform the scoring, found no evidence of dumping by Monsanto.

But investigators uncovered records linking about 1,400 gallons of oily waste from J.H. Baxter’s wood-preserving plant to the landfill and detected pentachlorophenol at levels above federal drinking-water standards. Pentachlorophenol is a highly toxic, manmade substance that doesn’t break down easily.

It’s why the Superfund program and its ranking system do not clear a site of risk. Instead, they try to document what the risks might be at any particular site.

Leachate likely in standing water

An April 1993 EPA memo summarizing the site inspection said “groundwater was characterized as extremely variable and inconsistent” and recapped its findings from the 1984 assessment and another assessment in 1992 commissioned by DEQ.

Potential leachate was tracked during landfill operations in the 1970s through 23 monitoring wells, but the wells were so poorly constructed that they produced inconsistent, inconclusive data.

The EPA determined that earlier groundwater studies were insufficient and concluded the landfill’s waste was periodically saturated with groundwater.

A new water quality assessment — part of the 1992 assessments — showed that a nearby pond, between the former KEED radio station site and the Willamette River, likely had leachate in its water. This is different from the pond, also called the boat basin, connected to Patterson Slough north of the landfill, though assessments found poor water quality with signs of seeping from buried waste.

Samples from the small pond with possible leachate showed low levels of the metals arsenic and barium, which at high concentrations can affect the heart and nervous system.

Potential sources of the arsenic included herbicide and fungicide formulations as well as wood-preservative products, according to the assessment. The pond is near a monitoring well where tests found pentachlorophenol.

Nearby riverbanks, where water may have been discharging, were stained reddish-brown with a sheen in a small cove. Both the pond and standing water throughout the meadow had a film described as “orange scum.”

The discoloration was visible enough to prompt complaints, including the one raised with DeFazio. But because the landfill did not meet the Superfund threshold, the EPA was no longer involved and could only pass recommendations to state and county officials.

EPA administrator Dana Rasmussen wrote to DeFazio:

“Although the EPA does not have authority to take legal action against parties that may violate current federal solid land disposal criteria, they may be enforced in federal district court through the citizens’ suit provision of Section 7002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.”

Regulatory requirements

While similar to Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is a separate law with a different purpose. Superfund focuses on cleaning up and redeveloping contaminated sites, while the latter governs how hazardous waste is handled and monitored.

Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 1976, two years after the Day Island Landfill closed. The law was in full effect, mandating monitoring and handling of landfills, when the EPA conducted its Superfund site inspection in 1993. But records do not show whether the landfill’s legal compliance under the law, referred to as RCRA, was discussed during that time.

DEQ added the Day Island Landfill to the state’s list of contaminated properties in 1992, a designation meant to prompt Lane County, the responsible agency for the landfill, to take action. Along with the listing, DEQ sent conclusions and recommendations including details:

“The DEQ has determined that on-going ground water monitoring and landfill cap remediation will be necessary.”

“Further action is needed to evaluate the potential for off-site migration of contaminants to ground water and surface water.”

“Sediment from the pond with the reddish-orange staining should be sampled seasonally.”

If monitoring had shown hazardous releases that posed risks to health or the environment, it could have triggered action under hazardous-waste laws like RCRA. But Lane County can’t find the records that show if this monitoring happened.

In an email to Lookout, Lane County spokesperson Devon Ashbridge wrote, “Without a complete record, we can’t definitively answer your question about possible follow up that happened after the 1992 report.” She also said “no requirements related to RCRA were imposed in those reports.”

DEQ still lists the landfill as a “suspect” site and has not issued a final clearance letter or reviewed the property in more than 25 years. Spokesperson Dylan Darling said further action would require Lane County to enter DEQ’s Voluntary Cleanup Program, which the county has no plans to do, citing what it calls a lack of compelling new evidence.

An incomplete picture

Researchers who work at the intersection of natural and social environments such as Kyle Buck say monitoring should occur not just because the law requires it, but because, in cases like Pre’s Trail, the picture remains incomplete.

Buck is an environmental professor at the University of Vermont and served nearly 10 years at the EPA as a research geographer. Although he has not studied the Day Island Landfill and could not speak to it specifically, he offered broader observations.

He echoed other researchers’ concerns about “known unknowns.” In other words, what is known — that toxic contaminants are present — is overshadowed by what remains unknown: what those contaminants mean for human health today. For example, the pond near Willamette River likely containing leachate still exists today, but it isn’t known how conditions have changed or stayed the same.

“Based on the chemicals there, I would be very concerned about any kind of water contamination,” Buck said. “This [landfill] is from the ’70s, so there is definitely no liner underneath, so things could be leaching down.”

Beneath the landfill is an aquifer, like a subterranean lake, that runs parallel to the Willamette River, tied into the region’s interconnected groundwater system.

In 1993, the EPA warned that contamination from the landfill could migrate through the groundwater system toward nearly 187 private and municipal wells serving more than 10,000 people through the Rainbow Water District.

Investigators did not find evidence of contamination reaching municipal wells at the time. And district leadership — which still contracts with the Springfield Utility Board to supply customers in areas west and north of the city — says their hydrology models show water from the landfill is not being drawn into its wells today.

Monitoring systems and liners help track and control how water can move through a landfill and limit future migration of contaminants. It’s why such landfill management is now required by laws like RCRA, Buck said.

Instead, the landfill raises questions that many in the community share — including Buck. Though he lives across the country, Buck, a cross-country coach, has visited Eugene and run on Pre’s Trail himself.

It is a landmark that runners and residents helped build after Steve Prefontaine’s death in 1975, fulfilling his vision for Scandinavian-style bark trails.

“Pre’s Trail is a big thing,” Buck said. “If you’re close to it and you’re a runner, you got to go, right?”

Community response

The Whilamut Citizen Planning Committee — a joint body created by the Eugene City Council and the Willamalane Park and Recreation District — has met quarterly since the early 1990s to guide stewardship and planning in the Whilamut Natural Area, which includes Pre’s Trail.

The committee had raised questions about the landfill before, and it’s back on their agenda.

At the committee’s fall meeting in October, held inside a yurt at Alton Baker Park, longtime members including David Sonnichsen had printed copies of Lookout’s first investigation into Pre’s Trail.

He knew there was a chemical deposit site in the landfill, but said that J.H. Baxter was never named in any of the documents he came across.

“The [committee] is the natural vehicle for raising an issue just like this. I felt like it was incumbent that we respond,” Sonnichsen said.

The committee is planning a meeting in November or December to discuss a letter to the city and county with concerns and requests. Meanwhile, people use the area almost constantly — for everything from international athletic championships to local stewardship projects like Riordan’s.

Before kneeling to plant a native Idaho blue-eyed grass, Riordan said he hasn’t seen the orange ooze himself. When he’s there, things are usually dried out. Still, he knows the history beneath his feet — the traces of a disturbed landscape — and how small acts of care like his can begin to change it.

“It can be hard to look at it and feel like it’s making a difference,” he said. “But just in the couple of years I’ve been working at the site, it’s completely different.”

In this patch, unlike others still overtaken by weeds, new green shoots pushed through, no pools of water around. Riordan tipped a plastic bin, roots dangling, and pressed them gently into the wet soil.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3806-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-16 11:05:03.474239

The movie “Network” is 50 years old, but the iconic sentiment, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore” is common. Households and sole-proprietor businesses like farmers see price-fixing and similar collusion all around them. They are “mad as hell,” but it is up to Congress if they will “have to take it.”

Despite President Donald Trump’s assertions that grocery prices are down, the last consumer price index showed that “food eaten at home is up 1.6%” since he took office and 5.5% over a year earlier. Turkey is up 25% over the last year. “Meat, fish and poultry” is up 5.2% from a year ago, with 2.2% of that between Inauguration Day and September.

Ground beef, a mainstay for many, was up 11.5% over 12 months and 14% since January. No, that’s not a mistake. The price fell from September to January but then bounced back up. Thus many consumers are mad as hell.

So farmers also are angry. Despite Trump saying the Chinese had promised to buy 12 million tons of soybeans this year, none have moved. Yet prices of inputs for 2026, especially fertilizer, are high relative to prospective crop prices.

Beef is one bright sector. Slaughter cattle prices are near record highs. Breeding herds are recovering after shrinking numbers during a decade of drought. But operations fattening cattle say that the gap between what they receive from packing plants and what consumers pay is widening further.

Members of Congress from farm states listen to their constituents. There are hearings on why fertilizer prices are so high. Others question why meat packers, both for beef and pork, seem to have growing market power allowing them to grab a larger share of profits. Members of key committees are speaking out and introducing legislation to fix problems.

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, is a key one speaking up on both issues. With a farm background, he has represented Iowa in Congress for a half-century following 16 years in the Iowa Legislature. Thus, when he challenges monopolistic abuses that raise farm input costs and lower farm product prices, he speaks from some authority. But in his condemnations, he misses a key variable – what Congress has done in the decades Grassley himself has been in Washington. That is nearly nothing.

Grassley’s degrees, a B.A., M.A. and most of a Ph.D., all are in political science. So he probably never learned a key incident in Spanish history that fits him and his congressional colleagues to a tee.

Islamic Moors occupied Spain for centuries, but were driven out in the 1400s. In 1492, they gave up their last holdout, the city of Granada and its stunningly beautiful Alhambra palace. As the surrendering Moorish king rode away, he looked back and shed a tear at what was lost. His harsh mother was pitiless: “You do well to weep like a woman for what you would not defend like a man!”

That is precisely what Congress needs to hear now. Why stage great street theater about monopolies raising meat and fertilizer prices in 2025 when successive Congresses and presidents did nothing to stop their growth since the early 1980s? In 1980, the biggest four beef packers had 38% of the total market. By 2020, it was 82%. Yet history shows it is easier to prevent monopolies from being created than to break them up after they become entrenched.

Moreover, while both parties have blame, in recent decades the GOP has been far more cozy with monopoly power than the Democrats. This is a shame, given that antitrust was a central issue for the Republican Party before World War I. Teddy Roosevelt was the greatest “trust buster” of all time. After Abraham Lincoln, Teddy was the greatest GOP president ever. He dared to call out “malefactors of great wealth,” something no one in either party will do today.

To better understand all this, review some basic microeconomics.

“Perfect competition” has many small producers, none of whom have any power to set prices. Every seller is a price taker in a market with many buyers.

Monopoly is the opposite. There is only one producer who, facing no competition, sets prices wherever they want. They choose a quantity and price giving the greatest profit. That is visible to disadvantaged buyers right now, whether purchasing beef roasts or ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

Abusively high prices are not the only problem. The quantity of output produced is smaller than what is optimal for society as a whole. Resources are used inefficiently. Greater quantities of resources are used up to produce one unit of product than would be in a competitive market. Finally, monopolies foster less innovation. Without the stimulus of having to compete with other producers, there is little reason to look for ways to do things better.

Understand there are few real-world examples of perfect competition and few of pure monopoly. At the first end, there is “monopolistic competition” in which some but not all of the conditions for pure competition exist. At the other, there is oligopoly. Just as “oligarchy” is rule by a few people instead of one person in a monarchy, so oligopoly is a market with only a few producers who compete little.

Most large sectors – airliners, steel, automobiles, motor fuels, locomotives, chemicals – are oligopolies. So are meats and several other food categories. So are fertilizer, seeds and farm chemicals.

When there are only a few producers, the danger for society is that these combine, agreeing to conduct their business as if they jointly are a monopoly. Such collusion is what angry senators are investigating right now. It is what Teddy Roosevelt fought 120 years ago. It was the heart of the 1903 Northern Securities Co. decision from the Supreme Court that broke up a three-railroad “trust” put together by St. Paul’s own James J. Hill.

Curbing monopoly power long was important to Republicans. Richard Nixon saw it was time to break up the regulated monopolies in telecommunications. His Democratic successor, Jimmy Carter, did the same for airlines, railroads and trucking, reforms that were finished by Republican Ronald Reagan.

But that changed with the new century. Democrat Bill Clinton’s Justice Department saw anti-competitive practices by Microsoft. It filed suit to break Microsoft into two companies – one for operating systems and another for applications, just as Standard Oil and International Harvester had been broken up a century earlier. In 2000, the government was clearly winning the case in court, but as soon as George W. Bush was inaugurated, the case was dropped.

That was the turn of the tide of any GOP antitrust action. With the 2010 Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court that legalized payoffs to politicians, anti-competitive collusion and price-fixing was given a free hand. Congress has stood by. They can hold all the hearings they want and pass all the bills calling for further study they want. But unless the president in the Oval Office and majorities in the House and Senate agree to promote competition, citizens should not expect much.

As a faith leader in our city, I am deeply committed to the well-being of both my congregation at Holy Trinity United Baptist Church and the wider community. Every day, I hear from my congregants who are struggling under the weight of rising costs, and who are worried about the future of their city. From grocery prices to housing, the steep cost of living and economic uncertainty for the future of the District is making residents worried about how they’re going to afford their daily expenses and put food on the table.

That is why I am concerned about the proposed D.C. Bottle Bill, which would add yet another cost to the daily lives of our residents and is the last thing we should be focusing on right now. This policy, while well-intentioned, would increase the price of almost all everyday beverages at a time when families simply cannot afford higher prices, especially at the grocery store.

This proposal also comes with logistical challenges that disproportionately affect low-income families and seniors. To recover the deposit, these folks would need to return their bottles and cans to designated sites. That’s a burden for those who may not have access to reliable transportation. For our seniors, many of whom live on fixed incomes and face mobility challenges, this system could mean losing money on every purchase.

The bill would also create significant financial burdens for small businesses that provide reliable jobs and meaningful connections for so many. These businesses are already struggling, from decreased patronage, difficulty retaining workers, to the lasting impacts of inflation, the pandemic and shifting customer habits in recent years, all on top of thin operating margins. They now face the prospect of new costs and administrative hurdles associated with this recycling program. This is really too much to ask. This bill would force them to make room for returned bottles and cans, devote staff resources to handle these new tasks and potentially increase prices on their customers.

As people of faith, we are called to care about our environment and be good stewards of our natural resources to make sure that our parks, rivers and public spaces can be enjoyed by future generations. We are also called to stand up for the city and families who we love. There must be a path forward of balance and fairness that does not make it harder for families and residents in the District who are struggling — and the city as a whole.

The D.C. Council has an obligation to hear these voices and reconsider this costly and burdensome proposal. We can come together to work toward a better solution — one that protects the environment and the well-being of the people and businesses in our community — but now is simply not the time.

This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action — on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more — including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Decision time

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad it could be.”

Momentum to phase out fossil fuels

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Getting Indigenous voices heard

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,” said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you’re trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn’t make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

“And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people’s behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. “Most people don’t even realize they’re there.”

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they’re protesting or backing. If you like what they’re doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn’t much you can do about it. “I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,” he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500 million a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state's “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency's air-pollution-fighting ""good neighbor"" rule.

___

This story has been updated to correct that one of the laws requires disclosures from companies that make more than $500 million a year, not more than $500,000 a year.

The Innovation and Prosperity Report prepared by the Innovation and Productivity Taskforce (IPT), identifies that prosperity flows to jurisdictions that own intellectual property, data and AI models. Manitoba now has the opportunity to turn strategy into measurable economic growth. Premier Kinew’s vision of making Manitoba a “Have Province by 2040” demands a laser focus on the only metric that reflects real lived prosperity: GDP per capita.

1. Intangible Asset Ownership

IP, data, and AI cannot sit in separate silos as they form a single system of economic value. In the modern economy, prosperity is based on ownership of intangible assets — patents, data, AI models that generate high-margin value. By merging Intellectual Property and Data & AI into one unified “Intangible Asset Ownership” pillar ensures Manitoba governs, commercializes, and retains its intellectual capital through a single strategic lens. When Manitoba owns the ideas created within its jurisdiction, it captures economic rents that directly raise GDP per capita.

The Federal Budget 2025 allocates $925.6 million for AI infrastructure and additional funds for renewed IP programs. Manitoba is uniquely positioned to host a green sovereign compute hub powered by Manitoba Hydro enabling the province to control both the compute infrastructure and the IP layer to boosts productivity per worker keeping innovation value at home.

2. Commercialization and Capital Formation

Manitoba does not lack ideas; it lacks the capital to scale them. Early-stage companies lack the capital and procurement pathways required to reach global markets. A “Commercialization and Capital Formation” pillar would change this. A Manitoba Sovereign Innovation Fund (MSIF) co-investing with federal programs like the $1.75-billion Venture and Growth Capital Catalyst Initiative (VGCCI) and early-stage startups provide the financing needed to turn Manitoba-based startups into globally competitive firms. Mobilizing Manitoba’s pension funds and credit unions as patient capital partners would strengthen this pipeline. Combined with the federal Buy Canadian procurement strategy, Manitoba can ensure public investment fuels Manitoba-owned technology firms keeping IP, jobs, and tax revenues in-province.

The economic impact is immediate driving high productivity gains, creating high-value jobs, and generating strong tax base growth. This is the fastest lever to lift GDP per capita.

3. Infrastructure and Clean-Energy Trade Corridors

Manitoba’s infrastructure advantage is global. A unified “Infrastructure and Clean-Energy Trade Corridors” pillar reframes Churchill, the Hudson Bay Railway, CentrePort, transmission lines, and province-wide fibre as one integrated strategy tied directly to global markets. With the federal government investing heavily in Arctic infrastructure, defence, and critical minerals processing, Manitoba can position Churchill as a dual-use economic and security corridor, central to Canada’s northern sovereignty. Every infrastructure investment installed through this corridor reduces costs, expands market access, and boosts productivity across agriculture, clean hydrogen, critical minerals, digital services, and manufacturing. Manitoba has the potential to become the clean-energy and digital trade hub of Canada.

4. Skills, Talent and Enterprise Scale-Up

Skills matter but skills that scale firms matter more. Manitoba must tie talent development directly to enterprise growth and technology adoption. Expanding micro-credentials, university-industry co-ops, and rapid re-skilling programs in AI, hydrogen operations, and advanced manufacturing will ensure Manitoba develops and retains the talent required for a knowledge economy. A ‘Made-in-Manitoba PNP’ immigration program for founders, AI specialists, and technical experts would complement these efforts. When talent development is tied directly to enterprise expansion and scale-ups, Manitoba raises labor productivity and ensures its workforce drives economic transformation.

5. Sector Strategy and Global Integration

Manitoba must focus where it has global advantage: agri-value, critical minerals processing, clean hydrogen, digital infrastructure, and northern trade. A coordinated “Sector Strategy & Global Integration” pillar would align export development, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) attraction, and procurement around these sectors. Churchill’s global shipping reach can amplify this strategy by opening northern routes for hydrogen, critical minerals, and agri-food exports while strengthening Manitoba’s position in global supply chains. With a coherent sector strategy, Manitoba shifts from exporting raw goods to exporting high-value finished products and digital services raising value capture per worker and driving GDP per capita upward.

Cross-Cutting Enablers

Manitoba’s transformation requires three enablers that operate across all pillars. Federal–Provincial Alignment is essential enabler. Budget 2025 is the most innovation-focused budget in Canadian history. Manitoba must act quickly on joint proposals, co-funding opportunities, and long-term federal partnerships to secure its share.

Indigenous Partnership and Inclusion is another enabler. Indigenous Nations should be engaged as full partners and co-owners in infrastructure, clean-energy corridors, and innovation projects. This is reconciliation in action and smart economics.

Data-Driven Measurement and Accountability must guide every initiative. Manitoba needs a Innovation Dashboard that tracks productivity growth, export expansion, IP retention, firm scaling, and GDP per capita impact. What gets measured, gets improved.

Paraguay is strategically leveraging its vast reserves of clean, abundant hydropower to carve out a unique niche for itself as a premier technology hub in South America. By offering some of the lowest energy costs on the continent, the government is actively promoting the nation as a sustainable and highly affordable destination for international tech investments, particularly for energy-intensive sectors like data centers and artificial intelligence companies.

The Hydropower Advantage: A Foundation for the Paraguay tech hub

The cornerstone of Paraguay’s ambitious plan is its formidable energy infrastructure. The country relies almost entirely on hydroelectric power, with the massive Itaipu Dam alone providing approximately 90% of its electricity. This not only makes Paraguay the world’s leading exporter of clean energy but also creates a significant surplus of affordable, renewable electricity. This powerful combination is exceptionally attractive for industries where energy consumption is a primary operational cost, such as AI processing facilities and large-scale data centers.

While hydropower is the dominant force, the country is also beginning to diversify its renewable portfolio. The current Paraguay Solar Production Report shows a modest but growing solar capacity, signaling an awareness of the need for a more resilient and varied energy grid to support its long-term goals.

Government-Led Strategy for a Digital Future in the Paraguay tech hub

Under the leadership of President Santiago Pena, the Paraguayan government is taking decisive steps to transform this energy advantage into tangible economic growth. The administration is actively engaging with major Silicon Valley companies to attract investment and foster a vibrant tech ecosystem.

A central element of this strategy is the development of a $20 million digital park near Asunción’s international airport. This hub is designed to stimulate private investment and create a collaborative environment where academia, local businesses, and international tech firms can innovate together. This initiative is further bolstered by Paraguay’s young population, which represents a growing pool of human capital ready to be trained for the digital economy.

Beyond Tech: Building a Diverse Economic Ecosystem in the Paraguay tech hub

Paraguay’s push into technology aligns with its broader economic development goals, which include expanding its successful “Maquila” manufacturing sector and improving regional connectivity. This creates a compelling environment for other industries, including renewable energy manufacturing. With its low energy costs and strategic location, investors are exploring the feasibility of establishing a Paraguay Solar Factory: Choosing Asunción or Ciudad del ….

Setting up such an operation requires a deep understanding of the basics of manufacturing and the complete manufacturing process. Success hinges on efficiently sourcing the necessary raw materials, procuring the right manufacturing machines, and carefully managing a detailed plant cost breakdown.

A Regional Perspective on Renewable Energy and the Paraguay tech hub

Paraguay’s strategy does not exist in a vacuum; it is part of a larger trend across South America where nations are leveraging their unique strengths to attract investment. International investors often consult a Global Solar Report to compare opportunities across the continent. Neighboring countries offer different models within the Mercosur trade bloc; for example, establishing a Brazil Solar Factory: A Strategic Guide to the Mercosur … provides access to a massive domestic market, while Solar Manufacturing in Uruguay’s Free Trade Zones: A Guide presents a compelling case for export-focused businesses.

In summary, Paraguay’s combination of cheap, clean hydroelectric power, proactive government support, and a developing workforce creates a powerful foundation for its ambition to become South America’s premier technology hub, powered entirely by clean energy.

The announcement marks a dramatic turn for Delaware, long regarded as the corporate capital of America.
“For decades, Delaware was known for predictable court outcomes, respect for the judgment of corporate boards, and speedy resolutions,” Grewal wrote.
“But no more.” Coinbase’s departure is particularly notable because no other major company — tech or otherwise — has recently chosen to leave Delaware for another jurisdiction.
“This choice is much bigger than Coinbase,” Grewal wrote.","In a move that reverberated across corporate and legal circles this week, Coinbase — the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange — announced that it will formally leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas.

The decision, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, was accompanied by a sharply worded Wall Street Journal opinion piece from Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, who argued that Delaware’s once-gold-standard legal environment has devolved into an unpredictable arena driven by activist rulings and inconsistent outcomes.

The announcement marks a dramatic turn for Delaware, long regarded as the corporate capital of America.

More than a million U.S. companies generate more than a billion dollars annually in fees and associated economic activity.

But Grewal contends that the legal environment underpinning that long-standing relationship has eroded.

“For decades, Delaware was known for predictable court outcomes, respect for the judgment of corporate boards, and speedy resolutions,” Grewal wrote. “But no more.”

Coinbase’s departure is particularly notable because no other major company — tech or otherwise — has recently chosen to leave Delaware for another jurisdiction. In that sense, the crypto exchange is an outlier, though one that is seeking to position itself at the forefront of what it sees as a shifting national landscape for corporate governance.

Grewal argues that Delaware’s famed Court of Chancery, once regarded as the most sophisticated business court in the nation, has in recent years issued rulings that companies view as inconsistent, activist, or overly interventionist.

He notes that lawmakers in Dover have repeatedly attempted to patch over judicial surprises with ad hoc legislation — a stopgap solution that Coinbase believes is no longer sufficient.

The concerns, he suggests, go beyond the crypto sector.

In the past two years, Delaware has seen a spate of record-setting defamation and damages awards against corporations — verdicts that, while not involving Coinbase directly, have raised alarm among executives and corporate boards about escalating legal exposure in the state.

Many top companies have left Delaware or announced plans to do so, including the nation’s largest mall owner, Simon Property Group; retailer Dillard’s; Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management; venture firm Andreessen Horowitz; online retailer Mercado Libre; Roblox; Tripadvisor; Affirm; AMC cable networks; Madison Square Garden; President Donald Trump’s Trump Media; and Dropbox, among others.

Coinbase’s move to Texas reflects a growing effort by states to compete for corporate domiciles by offering streamlined regulations and predictable legal frameworks.

Texas, in particular, has taken steps in recent years to cultivate a business-friendly judicial ecosystem.

Grewal points to Senate Bill 29, a major reform that modernizes the Texas Business Organizations Code and codifies the business-judgment rule — long considered a pillar of deference to corporate decision-making.

Combined with the launch of the Texas Business Court system, these reforms give companies strong assurances about governance flexibility and the fair, efficient resolution of disputes.

Grewal wrote: “We believe we can drive forward our mission rapidly if given fair conditions. Our decision to leave is about ensuring more predictable opportunities for the company, our shareholders, our customers and the new on-chain ecosystem we’re building.”

While Delaware has dominated the incorporation landscape for decades, its reign is not inevitable.

“This choice is much bigger than Coinbase,” Grewal wrote. “It’s part of a movement of businesses choosing markets with favorable regulatory and judicial-review systems.”

“Copper, they say, is the next petroleum,” said Thyana Alvarez, Colombia vice president of Copper Giant, owner of the Mocoa project.
Copper Giant is committed to best practices of environmental stewardship and hiring locals, Alvarez said.
Around Mocoa, Copper Giant’s claims include several sacred sites, according to a statement issued by seven local Indigenous organizations this year.
That’s why Copper Giant works through the traditional social structures to provide in-kind support for customary activities, like communal work days, Vargas said.","MOCOA, Colombia—This isn’t the first time foreigners have shown up here, where the Andes Mountains meet the Amazon rainforest, insisting they needed what was under the ground.

First it was gold, recalled Zuly Rivera, a youth coordinator for the Nasa pueblo, one of several Indigenous groups that inhabit this densely forested region of southwestern Colombia. Then, it was oil. Now, as civilization’s appetite for energy evolves, a Canadian startup is prospecting for copper.

Advocates for copper mining here promise economic advancement, a new generation of responsible industry and a global transition to cleaner forms of power. But Rivera, who has stern eyes and long, black hair, senses a familiar story that is centuries old.

“They come to rob us,” she said. “For more than 500 years they have robbed us and today they continue.”

The daughter of social leaders and an administrator for her community’s territorial defense unit, Rivera is part of an activist network called Guardians of Andino-Amazonia that wants to prevent the development of a mine in the mountains above Mocoa, a small Colombian city surrounded by Indigenous reservations.

The Mocoa project by Vancouver-based Copper Giant, still in an early stage of exploration, is one of hundreds of potential copper mines advancing worldwide as part of a global rush to dig up metals for electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar farms and the data centers powering artificial intelligence. Most of these projects affect lands of Indigenous peoples, research shows.

Far from Mocoa, throughout the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, almost a dozen copper projects are in exploration or development, including three on the western edge of the Amazon Basin, where an accident or disaster could spill mine waste into one of the world’s most important and threatened ecosystems.

In the far eastern Amazon, more than 2,000 miles away, Indigenous protesters stormed into the 30th United Nations conference on climate change last week in the Brazilian city of Belém, decrying the ongoing destruction of Amazonian lands. World leaders are gathered there through Friday, considering what to do about a dangerously warming planet. Decades of discussions haven’t stopped the growth of global fossil fuel production or carbon emissions.

Now, amid surging energy demand from wealthy nations, the material needs of technologies meant to replace fossil fuels are fomenting their own wave of environmental threats.

Rivera, 34, gazed from a muddy ridge across the valley where Mocoa, founded in 1551, sits beside its namesake river, nestled between green, misty slopes. It’s not the copper she cares about losing, Rivera said. It’s the spirit of this place. She worries new roads through the jungle, new money in politics and an influx of new residents will eventually transform Mocoa from a secluded enclave of Indigenous cultures into a busy mining town.

“People from outside don’t know the value this has,” she said, waving her hand across the landscape. “For them, it is just a mountain.”

Surging Demand for Copper

Similar tensions are mounting around the world. A Norwegian copper mine in the Arctic faces opposition from Sami herders, and in western Canada the Tahltan Nation has denounced its exclusion from planning for two copper projects in its territory. A copper mine expansion in the Democratic Republic of Congo led to forced eviction of local villages and police crackdowns on protesters, while the U.S. Supreme Court, in October, cleared the way for an Arizona copper mine that will destroy sites sacred to the Apache.

These projects are fueled by billions of dollars from investors and governments aimed at producing materials for high tech manufacturing, and they want copper more than any other metal.

Copper forms the core of electric motors and turbine generators. It makes electrical cables, wires and circuit board pathways. A large solar farm uses hundreds of tons, according to the Copper Development Association, an industry group. A large data center for artificial intelligence uses tens of thousands of tons.

Demand for copper is expected to surge by 24 percent over the next decade, said the market intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie in an October report. Getting there will require building dozens of new mines at a breakneck pace.

“Copper, they say, is the next petroleum,” said Thyana Alvarez, Colombia vice president of Copper Giant, owner of the Mocoa project.

Alvarez, the daughter of a mine engineer, knows about this region’s bad experience with petroleum. Since the 1970s, oil companies have brought outsiders, pollution, deforestation and paramilitary violence with unrealized promises of community development.

Copper doesn’t have to be this way, Alvarez said. It presents “an opportunity to not repeat the errors that others committed.”

For the last four years, Copper Giant has donated to schools, churches, sports teams, communities and colleges in Mocoa and beyond trying to foster a consensus around the project, Alvarez said. The company is building a highway bridge over the Mocoa River, a smaller bridge at a rural community inside its claims and a new road for heavy vehicles between them. Copper Giant is committed to best practices of environmental stewardship and hiring locals, Alvarez said.

The company, however, can’t speak to specifics of a potential mine, still years away. Copper Giant is just an exploration firm—an investor-funded enterprise that acquires and develops mineral reserves with hopes of selling them to a much larger mining company. So, Alvarez can’t say if it would be a surface mine that scrapes away landscapes, or an underground mine that taps deposits through shafts. It would probably be an underground mine, she said.

“A New Chapter”

Copper has stirred excitement in Colombian business and politics. Alvarez, whose father worked his career at the country’s largest coal mine, was named one of Colombia’s most influential women of 2025 by Semana magazine for her leadership in emerging industries and the energy transition.

Currently Colombia’s top exports are oil, coal and black-market cocaine. But the metallic deposits in its Andes Mountains formed in the same way as deposits in the Andes of Chile, the world’s top copper mining country, suggesting high production potential.

“We are opening a new chapter,” Álvaro Pardo, head of Colombia’s National Mining Agency, told the market intelligence service ChemAnalyst at a conference in March, where he announced auctions of 17 new copper leases. “It’s about securing our infrastructure, powering our green energy transition, and establishing Colombia as a self-sufficient copper producer.”

In the mountains above Mocoa, Copper Giant studies from 2022 estimate the company’s claims held 2.3 million tons of copper—enough to run high-power industrial wires around the Earth 96 times. This year, Copper Giant changed its name, previously Libero Cobre, to reflect its “belief that Mocoa is not simply a deposit, but potentially part of a much larger, district-scale copper system,” an announcement said. Two months later it expanded its mining claims by 64 percent to span nearly 340,000 acres.

“We’re building the technical foundation for the next phase of Mocoa’s growth,” said Copper Giant CEO Ian Harris in a press release last month.

The buzz has made locals nervous. The environmental group Guardians of Andino-Amazonia, founded in 2022, has organized festivals, hosted forums, visited schools and produced theater performances to raise awareness about what’s at stake if mining commences in the mountains where several rivers originate.

“People need to know more,” said Sirley Cely, a member of the group and Mocoa chapter vice president of Colombia’s Community Action Boards, a national civic organization. “The copper will go to sustain the lifestyles of the Northern countries, as always, but at the cost of wellbeing in the Southern countries.”

Cely, 43, lives 15 minutes outside Mocoa’s urban center, down a muddy road in a forested hamlet with five wooden houses surrounded by palm thickets, native fruits, giant ferns and mossy trees that twinkle with colorful birds. She planted many of these, she said, strolling barefoot through her wild garden.

Families around here depend on tourism, she said. Eco-lodges host foreign visitors, while shops and restaurants along the nearby river cater to residents of Mocoa, who flock here on weekends to bathe in clean water from the mountains.

If copper’s potential is as big as the businessmen insist, Cely worries what it means for this place in the Amazonian highlands.

“The culture of our territory would change,” she said as tamarin monkeys chirped in the canopy above her house and a pig napped on the porch. “We’d end up being a mining city.”

The Energy Transition and Indigenous Land

Thousands of projects like Mocoa are advancing globally. Most are located on or near the lands of Indigenous people or small, traditional farmers, according to a study published in 2022 in the journal Nature Sustainability.

The study tallied 5,097 projects to mine metals for the energy transition, including more than 1,500 operating mines and almost 3,600 in development. More projects targeted copper than any other metal. The study said almost 70 percent of operating and proposed copper mines, about 1,400 projects, sit on or near Indigenous territory.

Around Mocoa, Copper Giant’s claims include several sacred sites, according to a statement issued by seven local Indigenous organizations this year.

“There can be no energy transition or real sustainability if it is based on the destruction of sacred territories,” it said. “This is not just an Indigenous struggle: it is an ethical and urgent call for the survival of life on Earth.”

Copper Giant’s claims also include parts of three reservations that belong to Inga groups, the most populous Indigenous ethnicity around Mocoa. In October, Copper Giant announced the conclusion of negotiations with the Condagua Inga reservation and adoption of an agreement “to protect cultural identity, strengthen local capacities, and ensure that development in Mocoa advances in balance with nature.”

But the impacts of a mine would reach farther than the reservations within its claims, said Ingry Paola Mojanajinsoy Buesaquillo, chair of the association of Inga councils in the city of Villagarzón, 10 miles downriver from Mocoa. Everyone who relies on the rivers that flow from those mountains, she said, should worry.

“The copper project affects us all,” Mojanajinsoy said, speaking in a garden of the association’s headquarters. “They are above and we are below.”

Communities will wither without their water sources, she said. She’s seen it happen thanks to oil drilling. This week she’s in Brazil, at the U.N. conference on climate change, asking leaders to stop the advance of oil companies in her territory, as well as the copper mines that are supposed to replace them.

“Do the energy transition without sacrificing Indigenous territory,” she said. “Otherwise it’s going from one bad thing to another.”

Waste and Other Risks

The biggest environmental risks of mining operations stem from their enormous volumes of waste. Mine operators crush millions of tons of rock, mix it with fluids, extract small concentrations of desired metals, then discard the sludge, called tailings. To contain tailings, companies build pits, dams and other impoundment structures, which periodically fail.

For example, this year in Zambia, a dam on a tailings reservoir broke at a copper mine, spilling the toxic sludge into the country’s main river. In Brazil, a tailings dam collapse in 2019 flattened nearby villages and killed 270 people. Another Brazilian tailings dam failed in 2015, spreading pollutants along more than 400 miles of waterways. Tailings dams collapsed in 2014 at copper mines in Mexico and Canada, contaminating water sources of Indigenous communities.

Mine waste contains natural minerals that may be harmful. Studies of tailings from Andean copper deposits in Chile found arsenic and cadmium, which cause cancer, as well as lead and other heavy metals. The tailings also contain sulfide minerals like pyrite, which transform into acid when exposed to air and water, dissolving rocks, carving pathways and creating runoff.

Other studies in Chile have identified tailings contaminants in farm soils several kilometers from a copper mine, and in the air of Indigenous villages some 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) away. The city of Calama, known as Chile’s copper capital, has lung cancer rates almost three times the national average.

Natural disasters can also destabilize mines. This year, earthquakes caused a deadly collapse at a copper mine in Chile and flooding at a copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A landslide in September killed seven workers at an Indonesian copper mine. Mocoa suffered a catastrophic landslide in 2017 that killed more than 300 people and left many locals wary of plans to mine in the mountains.

“Mining is a risky activity,” said Oscar Jaime Restrepo Baena, a mine engineer and professor at the National University of Colombia’s school of mines in Medellin. “It must be done well and it must be done responsibly.”

Colombia lacks experience with mining or comprehensive mining policy, he said. But with the right balance of foreign technical expertise and local community involvement, he believes Colombia can develop a clean, safe mining sector.

He said the Mocoa project has “enormous potential,” and that Copper Giant has conducted notable public outreach to win local support.

“Communities are right to have fears, and companies have an obligation to address them,” Restrepo said. “Trust isn’t given overnight. Trust must be earned.”

Oil’s Dirty Legacy

Mojanajinsoy does not trust the company. For her, mining disasters are easy to imagine. Despite promises of a clean energy revolution, her expectations for copper come from her experience with oil.

Spills have become part of life since oil companies arrived decades ago, she said. The largest in recent memory happened just over a year ago at a site owned by Canadian driller Gran Tierra on the Wasipungo Inga reservation, a 1,780-acre forested preserve where Mojanajinsoy lives with her two daughters and hundreds of other Inga families.

It left oil in the creek for eight months, she said.

“The rivers have suffered,” Mojanajinsoy said. “After they are contaminated, they don’t go back.”

Local news websites ran a press release from Gran Tierra that blamed vandals for opening the valves of eight tanker trucks. In a statement to Inside Climate News, a Gran Tierra spokesperson said the company led and paid for cleanup after the spill, and that it continues to support local authorities investigating who was responsible.

“We believe that responsible energy development should generate long-term value for people, communities, and the country,” said the spokesperson, Nicolas Barrios Rubio. “Gran Tierra Energy is committed to protecting freshwater resources in Colombia.”

Water pollution isn’t the worst of Mojanajinsoy’s fears. Beyond environmental destruction, oil drilling brought cultural destruction of Indigenous people as the flood of wildcatters, money and development gradually pushed the Inga and others to the periphery of their own lands.

“Territory is everything, for the culture to continue, for new generations,” Mojanajinsoy said. “Culture gets lost with the territory.”

“We’re in an unstoppable loss of that ancestral knowledge,” said Carlos Fernandez, a local representative of the international nonprofit Amazon Watch. “Many of the pueblos are in danger of cultural extinction.”

An “Important Step”

Miguel Vargas Vidal, an ethnic liaison for Copper Giant in Mocoa, understands why people are suspicious. He also experienced the problems of oil drilling here. A member of the Guitoto Murui pueblo, he lives with his Inga wife on a reservation.

Vargas visits rural communities in the areas of Copper Giant’s exploration activities to learn about their needs, explain the project and build trust with the company. He reminds them Copper Giant isn’t a mining company, only an exploration company. Copper will not be a repeat of oil, he insists.

“We should learn from those errors,” he said. “We don’t have to be afraid.”

Development for Indigenous people doesn’t mean building roads and stores, he said. It means fortifying culture. That’s why Copper Giant works through the traditional social structures to provide in-kind support for customary activities, like communal work days, Vargas said. The company also sponsors traditional carnivals for the communities.

In October, when Copper Giant announced its agreement with the Condagua Inga reservation, it laid out six initiatives to protect cultural identity, preserve the Inga language, acknowledge traditional ecological wisdom and safeguard local water sources.

Vargas said environmentalists have spun up dramatic scenarios to spread fear about the copper project: that it will collapse the mountain, that it will contaminate the water, that its riches will go to foreign countries. He asked how they can make such specific predictions about a mine plan that doesn’t exist yet?

“The unknown always generates fear,” he said. “We’re making sure this is done well.”

It’s not just a local opportunity, he said, but a calling to contribute to humanity. The world needs copper if it wants to replace the vehicles and power plants that burn fossil fuels. Colombia has copper to offer. It would be selfish not to contribute, Vargas said.

“It’s clean energy. This is the 21st century,” he said. “We have to take this important step.”

An Older Kind of Wealth Lost in the Process

Rivera, the youth coordinator for the Nasa pueblo in southwestern Colombia’s dense forest, still wonders if the energy transition is a step forward for Mocoa, or just more business as usual. She has heard about the energy transition for years at regional summits and U.N. conferences on climate and the environment. Meanwhile, she said, the conditions of Indigenous peoples here have only continued to worsen. She’s never seen an electric vehicle in Mocoa.

“We aren’t interested in your flying cars and robots in Europe and Asia if all the minerals come from South America,” she said.

She doubts that anyone actually needs this copper. Europeans needed gold, but what they took only sits in dark vaults. Gold mining continues to menace the Amazon. North Americans needed oil, then they burnt what they took and now, apparently as a result, they need copper. And they still need oil.

If this is a transition away from fossil fuels, will the drillers leave? Or will the mine settle in beside them as one more hazard eating away the most vibrant ecosystems and oldest cultures on earth, Rivera asked.

She knows people are tempted by the treasures foreigners bring, and she understands the struggles with poverty. She learned about her community as a child trailing her mother, a teacher, and her father, governor of their territory. Now she gives seminars to help Indigenous youth understand they aren’t as poor as they often are told.

“We aren’t interested in your flying cars and robots in Europe and Asia if all the minerals come from South America.”

They also have wealth and inheritance: the knowledge of fish, fruits, medicines and spirits of the forest, which their cultures acquired over ages; the unspoiled places their ancestors left them; the mystical beauty that nourishes and makes them happy. “All of that is part of our riches,” she said.

The outsiders don’t see it. They trample it digging up their own riches, which they ship to their countries, leaving the social fabric of local communities disfigured.

Whatever wealth the communities acquire, Rivera said, comes at the cost of an older wealth that gets stolen and forgotten.

“They think riches are about having so many cars,” she said. “I think riches are being able to live and enjoy the water.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LAFFAY_TPL_MOC_25008_2801.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 08:58:44.593746

During the day, the Rondo Heat Battery stores energy in ultra-durable bricks; at night, it releases that heat to produce constant, high-pressure steam.
By replacing natural gas with solar energy, the technology could help facilities avoid volatile fuel prices and slash climate-warming pollution.
Industrial heat drives more than 25% of global energy use, so this breakthrough has enormous potential.
""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek.","A California oil facility just hit a major clean-energy milestone, and it could reshape how factories, refineries, and other heavy industries stay powered.

Rondo Energy has switched on what it says is the world's largest industrial heat battery, proving that solar power can now deliver the extremely high heat required to run industrial operations around the clock.

According to Electrek, it is located at a Holmes Western Oil facility in California, and the 100-megawatt-hour system is charged entirely by an onsite solar array.

During the day, the Rondo Heat Battery stores energy in ultra-durable bricks; at night, it releases that heat to produce constant, high-pressure steam.

After 10 weeks of daily operation, the system has already surpassed expectations, hitting over 97% efficiency and delivering temperatures above 1,000°C (1,832°F). That's the heat equivalent of about 10,000 home heating systems.

Because the heat battery plugs into the facility's existing infrastructure, it can supply steam through the same pipes used by gas-fired boilers, meaning no costly retrofits.

By replacing natural gas with solar energy, the technology could help facilities avoid volatile fuel prices and slash climate-warming pollution.

Industrial heat drives more than 25% of global energy use, so this breakthrough has enormous potential. Methane, a byproduct of dirty fuel extraction and burning, is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide at heating the planet, so reducing its release can slow the rate of rising global temperatures.

""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek. ""Our customers are improving their competitiveness and slashing their carbon emissions at the same time.""

This development mirrors other game-changing innovations, such as tech enabling cleaner power plants and revolutionary fuel research that boosts energy resilience.

Together, they signal a trend: cleaner tech isn't just for homes and EVs anymore — it's rapidly transforming big industry, too.

For everyday people, smaller-scale solutions offer similar benefits, from community solar savings to energy-efficient upgrades at home.

Installing solar panels is one of the ultimate home energy hacks — in many cases, it can bring your energy bill down to near $0.

EnergySage provides a free service that lets you compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar.

Going solar also makes running other energy-efficient appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500 million a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

Lebanon is joining the global artificial-intelligence wave, albeit with limited resources and mostly private initiatives, at a time when Gulf states are leading the region in deploying AI to boost national economies.

Expectations point to long-term, exceptional growth in this promising sector, which is attracting sizable investments aimed at modernizing societies and enhancing performance across both productive sectors and public services.

In remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat, AI specialist Hilda Maalouf noted that Gulf governments and private industries are moving in tandem to integrate AI across their systems.

She highlighted the region’s strong readiness, supported by major government-backed investments in advanced technologies and fast-expanding data-center infrastructure, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Lebanon, by contrast, faces deep structural hurdles, especially in the public sector. Still, Maalouf, an Oxford-certified AI expert, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the country retains a dynamic private sector and high-caliber talent striving to stay competitive in IT and AI, despite crippling power outages and a weak internet network that has stalled the rollout of 5G.

According to Omar Hallak, partner and head of the public-sector practice at global data and AI consultancy Artefact, the Gulf’s ambitious national strategies have put it far ahead of other regional countries.

Readiness rankings confirm this: the UAE ranks 13th globally in the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, followed by Saudi Arabia (22nd) and Qatar (32nd). Lebanon stands at 82nd worldwide.

These disparities, Hallak explained, reflect the widening gap between Gulf economies -now reaping the rewards of sustained tech investment - and countries like Lebanon, whose digital infrastructure and economic crises continue to hinder progress. Despite strong local talent and emerging startups, Lebanon’s AI transition remains slow due to limited government support and weak investment.

Gulf states have forged strategic partnerships with global tech giants such as Microsoft and OpenAI, attracting major cloud-computing providers to build advanced infrastructure.

Their remaining challenge is a shortage in national technical skills, where Lebanon, ironically, excels. Yet Lebanon continues to lose talent to migration while lacking the infrastructure to retain it.

Most Gulf strategies now focus on attracting global experts in data science and AI, in addition to training local citizens. Saudi Arabia aims to train 20,000 specialists by 2030, while leading universities, including King Saud University and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, are expanding AI programs.

Economically, AI is expected to add $260 billion to Gulf economies by 2030, with Saudi Arabia alone projected to gain $135 billion (12.4% of GDP) and the UAE about $96 billion (13.6%). The World Economic Forum reports that Gulf economic prospects already outpace global averages, driven by technological transformation.

According to analysts, AI adoption will enhance productivity, reduce bureaucracy and corruption, and stimulate public–private partnerships. Gulf states are particularly well-positioned in finance, energy, health care, and education. In Lebanon, AI’s most promising impact lies in service-based sectors such as tourism, transport, finance, education, and health.

Hallak added that sectors rich in data, including public services, finance, energy, manufacturing, and telecommunications, will be the primary drivers of AI adoption across the region, especially in economies where energy and natural resources remain central to growth.

Egypt has targeted procurement of five million metric tons of local wheat next season as it moves away from being one of the world's top wheat importers to self-sufficiency, the supply ministry said on Sunday.

Egypt typically imports about 10 million tons a year, with the state buyer obtaining roughly half of that for the country's bread subsidy program on which 70 million people rely.

In the first half of this year, however, imports were a quarter less than the same period last year, according to shipping and trading data reviewed by Reuters.

The government's share of those imports dropped by more than half to about 1.6 million tons, reflecting slower procurement since the state buyer changed from the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC) to the military-linked Future of Egypt for Sustainable Development (Mostakbal Misr).

While the supply ministry said that it procured more than 4 million tons of wheat during the domestic harvest, data seen by Reuters shows that the government bought about 3.9 million tons, slightly below its announced target of between 4 million and 5 million tons in the season from mid-April to mid-August.

Reserves of strategic commodities are within safe buffers and as high as last year or higher in some commodities, the supply ministry added without providing more data.

This is stated in a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

According to the study, Oman already has a fully integrated steel production ecosystem, including iron ore enrichment, pellet production, direct reduction technology, and electric arc furnaces. The country also plans to develop new ore enrichment capacities.

However, without switching from gas to green hydrogen, new DRI projects will not be able to claim the benefits of corresponding market premiums.

The country also has great potential for renewable energy, given the significant investments in both solar and wind generation. Cheap, reliable clean energy could be a major advantage for steel producers in Oman.

The country has a clear, coordinated strategy to become a leading center for green hydrogen. Oman aims to produce 1-1.5 million tons by the end of the decade. The metallurgical industry could play a central role as the main buyer.

The existing advantages are reinforced by strong political support and a favorable regulatory framework.

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai made the announcement alongside Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican.

The company said it plans to strengthen the state’s workforce by training current electrical workers and over 1,700 apprentices in Texas by 2030 — more than doubling the state’s anticipated pipeline of new electricians.

Google said it is dedicated to expanding its infrastructure responsibly by adding new energy resources to the grid, covering the costs of its operations, and investing in community energy-efficiency programs.

The investment marks another major tech expansion in Texas tied to artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Google is building three data centers in the state: one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County. One of the Haskell County centers will include a solar and battery storage facility to reduce strain on the grid.

“Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy,” Abbott said in a statement.

“Google’s $40 billion investment makes Texas Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state.

“We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen,” he said.

Data centers consume large amounts of energy to power servers and cooling systems. Their rapid expansion in Texas, along with population growth, is projected to nearly double the state’s electricity demand by 2030.

Texas’ data capacity has grown quickly due to affordable energy, easy access to the grid, and a favorable business climate.

“They say that everything is bigger in Texas, and that certainly applies to the golden opportunity with AI,” Pichai said.

Discussions on boosting emissions-cutting ambition, the provision of finance by developed countries, unilateral trade measures and reporting of national data on climate action were “open, constructive and transparent”, COP30 boss Andre Correa do Lago said.

He said the presidency would prepare a note summarising the discussions on those topics to be published on Sunday, as a basis for countries to take them forward.

But as ministers jet into the Amazon city without draft decision texts to work on in many areas, technical deliberations will wind down and political wrangling ramp up. Invoking the Brazilian “Mutirão” spirit of togetherness, Correa do Lago laid out his masterplan for the week ahead, modelled on three parallel tracks.

At COP30, roadmap away from fossil fuels gains ground – but next step unclear

Technical work will continue until Tuesday on formal negotiating tracks. Those include the Global Goal on Adaptation, with countries meant to leave Belém with an agreement on a set of metrics to track countries’ resilience, and the Just Transition Work Programme.

While negotiators wrap up those technical details, pairs of ministers from developed and developing countries will start collecting views on issues that require higher-level political deals, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, finance and adaptation.

They are due to report back to the presidency by Tuesday, allowing countries to gauge how near – or far – they are from a successful outcome. “Work together as one team to find solutions,” Do Lago urged delegates.

Meanwhile, presidency consultations on the four issues without a home will continue while the COP president will convene a “Mutirão” meeting of ministers and heads of delegation early next week to “bring together various outcomes”.

While the Brazilian hosts have so far managed to keep clashes between countries out of public view, experts say gloves are likely to come off soon.

David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute (WRI), said the presidency has given countries so much room to manoeuvre that it has created an impression of fewer tensions than usual.

“But that will shift pretty quickly next week once we start to see things really getting a bit clearer and more crystallised,” he added.

COP’s climate march takes to the streets again

Indigenous peoples, climate activists, feminist organisations, clowns, friars, cyclists and more came together on Saturday under Belém’s baking sun for the “Great People’s March”, a demonstration demanding climate justice and territorial protection.

Thousands joined the first march outside the COP venue in four years, as the last three summits were held in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, places where street protests outside the COP venue were not permitted by the authorities.

Saturday’s march in Belém ended peacefully at the Aldeia COP, a village designated by the Brazilian government to host the more than 3,000 Indigenous people who travelled to attend the conference.

During the first week of COP, it was mainly Indigenous people who led the two biggest civil society actions: a flotilla sailing on the Amazon River delta on Wednesday and a blockade of the conference centre’s entrance on Friday. Thousands also participated on Saturday.

The props seen at the march included a statue of US President Donald Trump riding on the back of a worker and a figure of Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva using a straw to drink “oil from the Amazon”. A network of green groups dressed in black staged a funeral for fossil fuels, carrying three huge coffins emblazoned with coal, oil and gas.

One of the Indigenous leaders present, Nelson of the Amazon Munduruku people – who organised the blockade of the COP venue entrance – said they were here “to fight, to bring the people’s vindication of resistance and struggle,” and reiterated their demand for a meeting with President Lula.

The soundtrack to the march changed from group to group of marchers, ranging from Indigenous chants and Brazilian music to shouts of Free Palestine and Free Congo.

Adaptation talks held hostage by finance

Finalising a list of 100 metrics to measure progress on adapting to more extreme weather and rising seas after two years of work may have seemed like a relatively straightforward technical win for the UN climate summit in Belém. The COP30 presidency were hoping they might even get it wrapped up in week one of the talks, which winds up on Saturday.

No such luck, as the negotiating groups for Africa, Latin America and the Arab countries have decided they want to use the talks on indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation as a place to press for more funding from wealthy governments. Earlier in the week, as we reported, they asked for two more years to discuss the metrics, which include “means of implementation” – code for how adaptation will be paid for.

By the mid-point of the talks – when negotiators compile their work into texts that are either ready to be approved or need further refinement by ministers who arrive on Monday – the latest version of the adaptation text was entirely inside square brackets, meaning that none of it has yet been agreed among countries. It will now fall to the presidency to find a way forward.

The text they’ve been handed shows no sign of any convergence of views, and includes two main options on adaptation finance – one which would have nothing at all and the other which reflects developing-country proposals for a new quantitative goal of either $120 billion (from the Least-Developed Countries) or $150 billion (Arab Group) a year by 2030.

Under a current target set at COP26 in 2021, donor governments pledged to deliver at least $40 billion a year by 2025. But with aid budgets being cut by many, current predictions are that they are on track to deliver little more than $25 billion, which leaves a huge gap compared with needs.

Global South’s climate adaptation bill to top $300 billion a year by 2035: UN

Parts of the proposed text released on Saturday also aim to prevent developing countries from being expected to fund their own adaptation measures and say that the indicators would be voluntary and left to countries to decide how to use them, in a bid to avoid being told what they should do to make their agriculture, water and health systems and other infrastructure more resilient.

Debbie Hillier, Mercy Corps’ UNFCCC policy lead, noted that the new text brings together the full spectrum of positions raised by negotiators. “The large number of options and brackets underscores how much work still lies ahead and how crucial ministerial engagement will be in resolving the core political divergences,” she said.

She pointed to the reference to providing at least $120 billion in adaptation finance for developing countries as a signal that “pressure is mounting for a serious response to the scale of adaptation needs,” adding that the text “recognises the urgency of delivering additional and predictable public finance”.

On Friday, African Group of Negotiators Chair Richard Muyungi told Climate Home News that a two-year extension of discussions on the metrics may not be needed if there is political will to unlock more funding for adaptation.

“[If] we get the means of implementation in the indicators, I think we’ll be able to agree [them] within the shortest time possible,” he added.

Business-as-usual: Donors pour climate adaptation finance into big infrastructure, neglecting local needs

While adaptation finance has erupted as an issue in the discussions on the metrics, negotiators on this track don’t actually have a mandate to decide finance matters. That is why the hot topic of whether and how to set a new target is also part of talks on the broader finance goal (NCQG) that was decided in Baku last year.

Sources told Climate Home News it may be more likely that adaptation could be allocated a share of the $300 billion a year developed countries agreed to mobilise for poorer nations by 2035 under the NCQG.

Future of $1.3-trillion roadmap uncertain at COP30

COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago today hosted a much-anticipated event on the Baku-Belém Roadmap, a document building on last year’s finance COP. It is meant to chart a way forward to meet a new goal to deliver $1.3 trillion-a-year for developing nations by 2035. But experts said the session failed to provide clear guidance and raised concerns that the roadmap could die in Belem.

The event, which is not part of formal negotiations, was originally scheduled for Tuesday but got pushed back to the weekend after countries failed to decide whether to start a conversation on finance at COP30.

Seven speakers – among them UN climate chief Simon Stiell – read statements for the first half of the 40-minute event, reiterating the roadmap’s main points — a shopping list of measures that could deliver the $1.3 trillion. A handful of governments and observers gave mostly positive feedback.

Ali Mohamed, special climate envoy of Kenya, proposed incorporating its short-term recommendations in the decisions made at COP30. One of those recommendations invites developed countries to consider working together on a delivery plan to achieve the $300 billion they are due to mobilise annually by 2035.

China’s delegate Chen Zhihua told the event that “greater clarity is needed on the implementation path” of that goal.

Corrêa do Lago emphasised that only the $300-billion core goal approved in Baku “is in the process of negotiation” and that the roadmap to 1.3T “is still something open”.

Roadmap to $1.3 trillion seeks to tip climate finance scales but way forward unclear

A representative of Colombia said, on behalf of the AILAC group of Latin American countries, that the report confuses actions to support developing countries with actions to transform all financing flows, and requested to discuss it formally in the UN climate regime.

Some observers were critical of the Brazil-led event at COP30, arguing that it risks leaving the formal negotiations with no clear guidance on finance.

“What happened today was not a conversation. It was not even a format that allows interaction with the presidency,” said Sandra Guzmán, director of the nonprofit Climate Finance Group for Latin America and the Caribbean (GFLAC).

She added that not enough developing countries were represented because at the time climate finance negotiators were in other rooms, attempting to carry the talks forward.

Joe Thwaites, senior climate finance advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said the risk of lacking clear guidance is that developed countries could fail to deliver the finance goal, as happened in the past with a previous $100bn goal that was delivered two years late. “I’m really worried that we’re going to be in the same position for the $1.3 trillion, which is a goal 13 times the size,” he added.

Azerbaijani lead finance negotiator Elmaddin Mehdiyev told Climate Home that the mandate to deliver the Baku-Belem roadmap has been completed and focusing on implementation is now “much more important”.

He added that getting the roadmap endorsed or welcomed formally by governments at COP30 was not key to taking it forward as it is a “non-negotiated document”.

Asked about this possibility after the event, Corrêa do Lago told Climate Home News: “There’s a movement starting, but we’ll see how the countries react. I think it’s unlikely to happen in Belém.”

Brazil launches flagship climate and trade forum

The COP30 presidency this Saturday launched a forum for countries to discuss climate and trade, seen by Brazil as one of its “flagship” initiatives outside of the formal talks.

Trade has been one of the most contentious issues at the summit in Belém, after the Like Minded group of emerging economies pushed for an agenda item on the topic at the start of the UN climate talks.

Several countries in that group – among them China, India and Iran – have been hit by US or European trade restrictions such as the recent US tariffs on solar imports. “Collaboration remains the only viable path to solving the global crisis; only through unity can we overcome it,” said Li Gao, China’s head of delegation at the launch event for the Integrated Forum on Climate Change and Trade (IFCCT).

After a week of consultations, countries have yet to agree on whether to hold such a conversation at COP30 and the first reactions to the IFCCT were lukewarm. A senior EU negotiator said on Wednesday that the bloc does not want to address trade disputes at COP that belong in the World Trade Organization.

For now, the Brazil-led forum is in a consultation phase, including on “modalities and thematic focus”, according to its official website. The IFCCT is intended to run for an initial phase of three years from early 2026 to end 2028 and is open for countries to join, it says.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/Portada-3-Funeral-dos-Combustiveis-Fosseis-Gentileza_-Artyc-Studio-amarilismarisa-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:06.300813

Trafigura Trading will supply 600,000 barrels while Energy Transfer Crude Marketing will supply 300,000 barrels, an Energy Department document said. The solicitation, which called for up to 1 million barrels, was announced in October.

The oil will be delivered in December and January to the Bryan Mound SPR site in Texas, the Energy Department said.

President Donald Trump's administration has been looking to replenish the SPR, but has been limited by a lack of funds and by ongoing maintenance at the reserve, held in a series of hollowed-out salt caverns on the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

Pumps, pipes and other above-ground SPR infrastructure are constantly exposed to corrosive, salty air.

Trump's tax and spending bill included about $171 million for the SPR oil purchases and maintenance, much less than the $1.3 billion that had originally been in the legislation.

Buying more oil for the SPR will likely require the passage of new legislation.

The previous administration of former President Joe Biden sold record amounts of oil from the SPR, including a 180-million-barrel sale after Russia, one of the world's top oil producers, invaded Ukraine in 2022.

In this assumed context they considered higher public investment would crowd out private investment.","Securing the foundations

Last year’s Budget set a new course in motion, but more is now needed to sustain change and secure stronger growth and higher living standards.

The country needs significant sustained investment. This must include ensuring decent public services can fully play their role in boosting productivity, growth and living standards.

To deliver effectively, action is needed to boost growth (and reduce costs of government borrowing) and to raise revenues.

Existing capital investment commitments should be at least protected and should be expanded – including by ensuring the National Wealth Fund has powers to borrow.

Faster progress is needed on closer EU trade.

Now is the time to address historic imbalances in how labour and capital are taxed, and to raise urgently needed revenues.

This should include a significant increase in the bank surcharge, CGT reform and increased taxation on gambling companies.

The government must also ensure that its approach to managing the public finances in the longer-term is conducive with securing strong, sustained growth – an independent commission should be established to consider how the management of our public finances should continue to evolve.

It is vital that we oversee our public finances using credible fiscal rules, but also that these rules are grounded in the evidence of recent years and promote economic stability.

Last year’s Budget set a new course in motion, but more is needed to sustain change and secure stronger growth and higher living standards. This will need higher public spending, and therefore action to both raise new revenues and bring down the costs of government borrowing.

Capital investment must be sustained and increased

The increase in public investment to 2.7 per cent of GDP, and associated infrastructure initiatives, is vital to growth going forwards. It is imperative that this approach is maintained in the years ahead. Without government action, the default trajectory would have seen UK industry remaining starved of long-term investment and shrinking further. Without continued public investment to drive industrial upgrades and boosts to productivity, UK manufacturing risks becoming increasingly uncompetitive, with domestic production offshored to countries with move active states.

Likewise action in last year’s Budget to free up further borrowing by changing the target measure to public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) was welcome. Government borrowing is now based on a more complete picture of the government's financial position than the traditional Public Sector Net Debt (PSND) measure. By including the value of financial assets like student loans and other government investments alongside liabilities, PSNFL allows the government to fund investments that build assets, which can then be used to pay off the debt over time. This increases the scope to increase public investment without violating borrowing rules.

The Treasury should now take full advantage of these new freedoms and empower the National Wealth Fund to borrow directly from capital markets to increase its capital pool – an approach that would be in line with our current fiscal rules.

Stronger EU trade should be secured as soon as possible

With UK exports to the US now facing additional tariffs, it is more important than ever that the UK can improve trade and investment with the EU, our closest and most integrated trading partner.

The TUC welcomes the priority the government has placed on building a closer UK-EU relationship and the achievement of the Common Understanding in May between the UK and EU. It is critical that the government secures as soon as possible the commitments outlined in the UK-EU Common Understanding to remove barriers to trade in agrifood products, EU carbon border tariffs for steel exports, enable young workers more opportunities to work and study in the EU and allow UK defence companies to bid for contracts from the EU SAFE fund - which will promote jobs across the country.

The TUC and our sister trade unions in countries across the EU have common objectives a closer UK-EU relationship as affirmed in the joint statement the TUC released with the European Trade Union Confederation in March. We would like to see the government build on the Common Understanding to:

remove barriers to trade in chemicals and pharmaceuticals which have faced significant additional costs since Brexit which have put jobs and conditions at risk.

see barriers for touring artists removed.

strengthen Level Playing Field commitments in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement by agreeing to implement improvements to workers’ rights made in the EU, so UK workers do not fall behind.

We look forward to continuing to engage with the government on the UK-EU reset negotiations, including through our role chairing the UK-EU Domestic Advisory Group.

Fairer, better taxes

Given the imperative to support and increase public investment, the TUC supports a wealth tax package with higher taxes on wealth, banks and gambling companies. Decent public services play a vital role in boosting productivity, growth and living standards – whether through improving the nation’s health, boosting educational performance or ensuring that people with caring responsibilities are able to work. In polling undertaken before the election, 81% of business leaders said that public services were important to the success of their business, and 89% said that public service improvements should be a government priority. The Resolution Foundation has set out the huge ‘in-kind’ benefit that public services make to the living standards of low and middle income households.

As well as raising vital revenues, fair taxes can also address wider policy challenges. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has recently warned that the UK tax system is characterised by “a large, unjustified and problematic bias against employment and labour incomes and in favour of business ownership and capital”. This can create wider distortions – with the incomes of low and middle earners taxed at rates that are much higher than those who make many times more from their investments. As workers spend a larger share of their incomes than the wealthy, the current design of our tax system is holding back wider spending (particularly important given the role of consumer spending in boosting growth).

While some have suggested that it is not falling real incomes but high savings rates holding back consumers, there is widespread evidence that savings may be concentrated among better off households. The Budget provides an important opportunity to start to correct this imbalance, while also raising some of the revenues needed to boost growth and rebuild our public services.

Our polling has also shown that there is significant support for a package of wealth taxes and taxes on financial institutions to fund better public services, and that this support comes from across the political spectrum.V More than two-thirds of adults support a package of measures to tax wealth, banks and gambling companies, while just 23 per cent oppose. This rises to 84 per cent supporting among Conservative to Labour switchers from the 2024 general election. And three-quarters (74 per cent) of 2024 Labour voters who are now learning towards Reform support the measures.

The public understand the need to act. Our polling also found widespread support for a modernised and simplified system, with three-quarters (73 per cent) supporting this. This rises to 83 per cent among Labour to Reform switchers.

Immediately, a package could include:

A windfall tax on banks. In recent years, banks have made significant unexpected profits because of increased interest rates. This has led to higher returns both from net interest (the difference on interest charged to borrowers and paid to savers) and interest paid to banks on reserves they hold at the Bank of England. As a result, bank profits are now even higher than they were in the period before the financial crisis. But under the Conservatives, taxes on banks were slashed just as these excessive profits kicked in. An increase in the bank surcharge to 16 per cent, double what it was before the Conservative cuts, could raise £20bn over the next four years. A 35% surcharge, which would be the same level as the windfall tax the Conservatives imposed on energy companies, could deliver £50bn over the same time period.

Reforming the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) system by equalising CGT rates with income tax rates and closing loopholes. This would build upon the changes to CGT already announced in the October 2024 budget and could raise a further £12 billion a year.

Increased taxes on gambling companies. Proposals for how to increase taxes on gambling have previously been put forward by the IPPR who have estimated that a package of taxes aimed at tobacco, gambling, vaping, alcohol and unhealthy foods could raise £10 billion by 2029/30. The changes to gambling taxes specifically could raise up to £3.4bn in 2029/30.

A 2 per cent tax on assets over £10 million. This would affect only 0.04 per cent of the population and could raise up to £24 billion a year. This would have to be carefully designed and implemented, with learning from other countries that have put wealth taxes into place. Budget 2025 provides an opportunity to consider the first steps that could be taken towards ensuring such an approach can be established.

In the medium term, wider reform is also needed. For example, there is a strong case for a review of property taxation where existing approaches are both unfair and damaging to growth.

A new fiscal commission

The government must also ensure that its approach to managing the public finances is conducive to securing strong, sustained growth.

Under the Conservatives the rules were changed nine times, and the public finances still deteriorated to an unprecedented extent (as set out above). While the Chancellor’s recent statement on the country’s public spending inheritance rightly pointed to the disarray and negligence caused by previous governments, the lesson from past failure must also be that an overly restrictive household budgeting approach to the public finances risks being counterproductive. It is pro-growth policies that will permit our national revenues to improve, and in turn these must be enabled by our fiscal framework.

Fiscal rules and fiscal councils are now part of governments’ public finance processes across developed economies. In a recent overview, the IMF describe fiscal rules as “a long-lasting constraint on fiscal policy through numerical limits on budgetary aggregates. Fiscal rules typically aim at correcting distorted incentives and containing pressures to overspend, particularly in good times, so as to ensure fiscal responsibility and debt sustainability.” They describe fiscal councils as: “often non-partisan, technical bodies entrusted as a public finance watchdog to strengthen credibility of fiscal policies with a variety of mandates.”

The IMF also note that these frameworks have become particularly widespread over the last two decades. In the UK, fiscal rules started with the introduction of Gordon Brown’s ‘golden rule’ that over the economic cycle the government would only borrow to invest and not to fund current spending. Fiscal rules have been part of the UK public finance policy ever since.

The UK fiscal council, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was then set up under Conservative Chancellor George Osborne in 2010 with the stated purpose of increasing “the role of independent expert oversight over the UK fiscal process” and as one of “the post-financial crisis creation of increasing numbers of Independent Fiscal Institutions (IFIs) across advanced democracies”.

Since then, in the UK and many other economies, fiscal frameworks have continued to further evolve. The IMF notes that post financial crisis many frameworks were reviewed to enhance “flexibility, enforcement and the monitoring of fiscal rules”. They also draw an important distinction between the pre-and post-pandemic periods, and note that in many cases government needed to deviate from their fiscal rule limits to deliver support. They reference the post-pandemic policy challenge of “whether and how countries should return to the limits and the fiscal rules, while ensuring credibility of the fiscal framework.” There have been suggestions that many countries are now starting to think about the ‘second generation’ of fiscal frameworks.

The TUC view is that there is a compelling case for further evolution of the UK public finance processes. This should recognise, as the IMF say, the importance of strong fiscal frameworks but also of ensuring that they are fit for purpose and responsive to changes in the economic cycle - rather than reinforcing them (i.e. rules should ensure they are not driving austerity during periods of slow growth when spending is needed to boost demand). The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has warned of “self-imposed and arbitrary fiscal rules” and urged a “rethink of the fiscal framework“.

Both NIESR and Andrew Haldane, former Bank of England chief economist, have set out that our current approach is holding back growth:

Not only are these rules are not being met, but they are also inadvertently constraining the public investment needed to improve economic growth

... Existing fiscal rules risk starving the economy of the very investment needed to boost medium-term growth and, ultimately, pay down debt and lower taxes.

Commenting on New Economics Foundation proposals to replace the OBR with a new institution to work alongside the Treasury, Mehreen Khan, Economics Editor of The Times, is more direct: “In 2025, that noble aim has created a created a perverse system where three technocrats have an outsized say over what the government of the day can spend or tax”.

We need to ensure that our approach to the oversight of fiscal policy reflects the learning of the last 15 years and is fully aligned with the government’s growth ambitions.

In this context, the TUC believes the government must act. Recognising the need to ensure any reform is informed by evidence, we propose the government set up a formal review to consider how the UK’s fiscal framework needs to further evolve to ensure it provides both fiscal and social stability in post-pandemic Britain.

We propose the review could include consideration of:

How the UK approach compares to best practice globally, both as countries respond to the experience of policy since 2010 and to the changing geopolitical context. Germany is only the most prominent country to refigure its approach to fiscal policy, with a ‘constitutional reform of its national fiscal framework’.

The advantages (and challenges) of expenditure targeting over the present fiscal mandate based on debt and deficit targets. Iain Begg of LSE has reported that “Many European countries with far healthier public finances have moved away from debt and balance rules in favour of what is known as an expenditure rule. The main reason is that the government directly controls expenditure and, especially if it plans it over a number of years, can set a stable path for the economy”.

Institutional arrangements including the operation of fiscal councils globally, the roles of the Treasury and OBR, and the timing of fiscal events, and how to make more meaningful assessments of investment outcomes over a longer time horizon. This could include consideration of the OBR’s role in producing the economic forecast, and whether there are institutional arrangements in other countries which could inform a new approach to building on external expertise in forecasting the impacts of specific policy interventions (for example labour market policy).

The role of modelling processes, and in particular the role of the controversial judgement that public expenditure ‘crowds out’ private expenditure, and, in the event of error, the implications for capacity and the output gap. This should keep uppermost the IMF conclusion: “On average, fiscal consolidations do not reduce [public] debt-to-GDP ratios”, which has certainly been the case in the UK. While all commentators including the OBR themselves recognise the role of uncertainty, existing mechanisms also have potential for bias. Ben Clift has set out that any such economic models are not politically neutral, “there is always a politics of economic ideas, and economic orthodoxy is always a social construction”.

The interplay between the OBR’s modelling processes and assumptions about policy at the Bank of England. Both institutions currently seem to take a closely aligned position on the output gap (the measure of spare capacity in the economy) and crowding out (the extent to which public spending displaces private investment). For instance, the OBR anticipated interest rates would have to stay higher for longer after the expansionary Autumn Budget 2024 as their modelling suggests limited spare capacity. In this assumed context they considered higher public investment would crowd out private investment. Separately Robert Chote (former Chairman of the OBR) wrote in 2024 about events in 2012/2013 when the OBR “show[ed] an extended period of spare capacity in the economy”, “… from which readers might have concluded that we felt the Bank needed more help from fiscal policy to bolster demand. That signal would have been clearer had we also forecast that inflation would persistently undershoot the target, but this would have had the Bank and Treasury straight on the phone”. The implication of his point is that the OBR was constrained in its ability to make the case for more demand stimulus in the economy, as it would have found itself in conflict with the Bank of England.

It is vital that we continue to manage our public finances using credible fiscal rules, but also that these rules are grounded in the evidence of recent years and promote secure growth and economic stability.",https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/TUC_secondary_logo_0.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:11.587619

On paper, as Comitta said, RGGI was a good idea for Pennsylvania.
They saw it as overly restrictive for the state’s energy industry, potentially a cost burden on families that use fossil fuel-generated energy in their homes, and considered the credits an “electricity tax” on energy producers.
But making its principles work for all sides remains critical to the economic future of the state and the health of its residents.
A clean-energy infrastructure should remain a worthwhile goal in Pennsylvania.","State Sen. Carolyn Comitta’s remarks on the Senate floor last Wednesday may speak more to the nature of compromise than they do a grave concern for the future of Pennsylvanians. Rest assured, though, that concern should be considered especially pressing.

The Democrat from Chester County cast one of the upper chamber’s 43 yes votes to pass the $50.1 billion spending plan that helped end a grueling, more-than-four-month-long impasse and threatened the financial stability of our most necessary public institutions and services. Because of votes like hers and the overwhelming passage in the state House of Representatives, public schools, social services and county governments that went without state funding since July 1 avoided any more consternation and pain than they already suffered.

There’s no question the resolution is long overdue.

There’s also no doubt that the biggest concession Democrats like Comitta made to get that deal done — essentially agreeing to pull the state away from a years-long commitment to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — opens up questions about the state’s environmental future that are important for anyone in the commonwealth. Especially the ones who call Northeast Pennsylvania home.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta, the minority chairperson on the Senate’s Environmental Resources & Energy committee reminded her fellow legislators. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote ‘yes’ to end this impasse.”

In other words, the commonwealth now has a budget, which is vital. But it now has no significant climate policy, which is also pretty important to have.

Then-Gov. Tom Wolf put Pennsylvania on course to join RGGI in 2019 as a feature of his long-term environmental policy to counter climate change’s effects. In it, Pennsylvania would have joined what is now a consortium of 10 other states in the Northeast, from Maine through Maryland, in an effort to make it the nation’s lone major fossil-fuel producing state to put a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide its energy producers could emit.

It is a cap-and-invest program proponents insist is both healthy for the environment and financially lucrative. States participating in the initiative can set a cap on CO2 emissions from power plants, which must purchase credits for every ton of CO2 they emit through quarterly auctions. States then invest the money made from these auctions in programs that promote clean energy innovation and efficiency, job creation and, conceivably, even lower rates for energy consumers in the state.

Perhaps just as important, the impetus for the power plants to become more energy efficient and reduce CO2 emissions rises as available credits decline.

On paper, as Comitta said, RGGI was a good idea for Pennsylvania. It was also an idea top state Republicans opposed practically since Wolf introduced it. They saw it as overly restrictive for the state’s energy industry, potentially a cost burden on families that use fossil fuel-generated energy in their homes, and considered the credits an “electricity tax” on energy producers.

Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, a group that advocates for environmental issues in Harrisburg, countered in a statement that leaving RGGI takes away what it estimates to be “$1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy.”

Gov. Josh Shapiro introduced a plan to the General Assembly that promises to create a state-run cap-and-trade program and require producers to invest in renewable energy, but it has plenty of detractors, especially among Republicans.

Given that Pennsylvania ranks behind only Texas among the nation’s top natural gas producers and is still in the top three when it comes to coal production — not to mention the potential boon it could see for nuclear energy producers that have no carbon emissions — it remains critical for lawmakers on both sides come to a common-sense solution that protects the environment, grants industry the opportunity to prove it can operate within parameters that lead to cleaner air, punish businesses that don’t hit standards and reward ones that do.

Leaving RGGI feels like starting over. But making its principles work for all sides remains critical to the economic future of the state and the health of its residents. A clean-energy infrastructure should remain a worthwhile goal in Pennsylvania.",https://www.citizensvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/STT-L-SPLBUDGET-0204-02.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:19.673061

— Erica Rosenberg, Western Lands Project

The future of federal public lands lies in the hands of the U.S. Congress as empowered by the American public. Whatever winds of influence and ideology blow through Washington also stir across vast acreages of American lands in the public domain of the commons.

In Aspen, Pitkin County and the greater Roaring Fork Valley, land giveaways have been many, although nothing near the scale of the decades preceding Aspen’s founding when, throughout the American West, land grants were excessive and often rife with fraud and scandal. By the time Aspen was settled in the 1880s, the outrages of earlier land grants had received pushback by a concerned public and were acted upon by congressional oversight that ended the most egregious giveaways.

Still, plenty of public land was doled out regionally to mining interests, homesteaders, railroads, schools, churches and others for what today seem like absurdly low valuations. An Aspen Journalism analysis conducted by Data Editor Laurine Lassalle of records available through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), General Land Office and Pitkin County turned up 1,175 patents issued in Pitkin County between 1880 and 1900. Information below is based on a further review of 97 of those patents.

For example, Roaring Fork Valley rancher Fred Light (1856-1931) filed for 160 acres of public lands in 1883 and, in 1886, paid $200 when the patent was approved. Light bought the land under a federal provision that invited homesteaders to file for patent under the 1820 Sale Cash Entry Act. The price was $1.25 per acre, about $40 per acre in today’s dollars.

Light’s “Box L Ranch,” in the Capitol Creek Valley, grew by additional acquisitions, including Light’s purchase of his wife’s family’s nearby ranch. A tribute written about Light as a civic leader recounted the profitability and size of his holdings. “Owning and operating with skill and success one of the finest ranches in Pitkin County, which is of ample size, comprising nine hundred and forty acres, and sufficiently fertile and productive to yield abundantly of cereals and hay and liberally support large numbers of cattle and horses. Frederick Light, of near Snow Mass, is so situated that he may laugh adversity to scorn and feel secure of an expanding and substantial prosperity during the remainder of his days.”

Light’s former homestead has, of course, escalated in value since his ownership. Today, the average value per acre in the Capitol Creek Valley is $69,000 for agricultural properties and $171,500 for agricultural/residential, according to an analysis of Pitkin County Assessor’s Office records.

Under a different federal land grant program, mining claims were granted to anyone who could prove that a property was economically viable, a stipulation of the Mining Law of 1872. Under this law, which is still on the books and widely considered antiquated, miners paid $5 per acre for both surface and mineral rights. Filers would often accrue multiple claims, as did a number of local partnerships from the early 1880s in Aspen’s first acquired mineral patents.

In 1884, a partnership of 10 individuals — including Josiah Deane, Aspen’s first lawyer and later patriarch of the T-Lazy-7 Ranch on Maroon Creek — was issued a patent on 4.49 acres for a mineral lode called “Mountain Ranger,” located near Little Annie Basin on the backside of Aspen Mountain. They paid $22.45 on the location claim first filed in 1881, the year the city of Aspen was incorporated with Deane’s legal guidance.

In 1884, a six-way partnership filed for a patent on a 5.85-acre mineral patent claim named “Grand Prize,” for which they paid $29.25. The partnership included David R.C. Brown and Henry “Grandpap” Cowenhoven, two of Aspen’s founding fathers who had arrived here in the summer of 1880 by wagons over Taylor Pass — the first wagons to enter the Roaring Fork Valley.

Brown is recorded in another partnership filed in 1887 with three others for the “Monongahila,” a mineral lode of 8.31 acres for which they paid $41.55. Brown and Cowenhoven partnered again in 1889 with four others on a claim called “Idlewild” of 13.04 acres for which they paid $65.20. Brown and Cowenhoven (sometimes in the name of Cowenhoven’s wife, Margaret, and Brown’s wife, Catherine, the daughter of the Cowenhovens’) appear in numerous entries, attributing to sound investments that made them Aspen’s first self-made millionaires.

Another Aspen namesake, Henry Tourtelotte, also appears in a number of entries, establishing patents on claims named “Tanner,” “Buckhorn,” “Castle” and “Silver Bell.” Many of these claim names are familiar today as mountain peaks, ski runs and campgrounds. Another local mining scion, Horace Augustus Warner (HAW) Tabor, shows up in many records associated with Montezuma Basin and the Montezuma claim, a mine he owned that remains visible today at a nosebleed altitude high above Castle Creek. Tabor, known as “The Silver King of Leadville,” brought his entrepreneurial reputation to Aspen along with an opera singer named Baby Doe with whom he had a notorious love affair.

Prominent founding Aspenites David Hyman and Jerome B. Wheeler are also listed in numerous patent entries as among the earliest investors in Aspen mining claims such as “Mose,” “Little Maggie,” “Dolly Dot,” “Morning Star,” “Little Nell,” “Alaska,” “Siberia” and “Durant.” Hyman and Wheeler represented Eastern capital, which was essential to Aspen’s development and which enabled the nascent city to sustain ore production years before the city’s two railroads ran tracks to Aspen and gave it economic viability. Hyman was a prominent lawyer from Cincinnati and was Aspen’s first major mining investor. Wheeler, for whom the Hotel Jerome and the Wheeler Opera House are named, was married into the Macy family wealth, owners of New York City’s first department store.

The Smuggler Mining Co., whose name still marks the mountain and open space playground bounding Aspen to the east, shows patents that provided access and ownership to one of Aspen’s richest silver mines. It was from the Smuggler Mine in 1893 that the largest-ever nugget of almost-pure silver, weighing more than 1,800 pounds, was broken into three pieces so it could be extracted and paraded on a horse-drawn wagon through the thriving city at the verge of the Silver Crash of 1893 when silver was demonetized and the U.S. currency shifted to the gold standard, abruptly and dramatically curtailing Aspen’s thriving mining industry.

Today, historic patented mining claims hold far-different valuations, not for industrial mining potential, but as real estate valued as high-end properties in Aspen’s resort economy. For what the records show as “mines” in Aspen, the valuation goes from an historic low of $4.50 per acre to $500,000 per acre today.

The Denver & Rio Grande Western (D&RGW) and the Colorado Midland built their tracks to Aspen from Leadville, surmounting the Continental Divide on trestles, through tunnels and around winding switchbacks, the construction of which required monumental physical labor. Those rights-of-way remain public thoroughfares today as the Rio Grande Trail (D&RGW) and Highway 82 (Colorado Midland).

The railroads were granted swaths of public lands as an incentive to build tracks and open the West to resource development. Roaring Fork commerce served silver mining and agriculture for which two competing railroads laid tracks over and through the mountains. Unlike earlier railroad ventures in the U.S. that brought commerce and trade to the nation and received vast land grants, Aspen’s two local railroads were granted only their rights-of-way, which still added up to considerable acreage, albeit linear and confined to specific corridors.

Cashing out the commons

As generous and readily available as local land grants were, the Roaring Fork Valley was small potatoes compared with enormous public land grants that mark vast Western landscapes today and could foreshadow a similar trend if the political powers that be in Washington take on the directives and intentions of the current Trump administration.

In a comprehensive 2009 report published by the Western Lands Project, “Carving Up the Commons: Congress & Our Public Lands,” its author, Janine Blaeloch, lays out the history of public land divestitures and describes the many ways public lands can become privatized, something the Trump administration has been applying as a means of capitalizing on extractive national assets. This is not the first time a Republican administration has attempted to commoditize the commons.

“Ronald Reagan’s Interior Secretary, James Watt, famously proposed during Reagan’s presidency (1981-1989) that public lands be sold to pay down the federal deficit,” Blaeloch wrote. “The Bush administration’s (2001-2009) budget for 2007 called for the sale of $800 million worth of U.S. Forest Service lands over five years and $182 million in public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the same time period.

“These periodic high-profile, sweeping, ideologically driven land disposal schemes gain the public’s attention because they are so over the top. What the public is largely not aware of is the fact that smaller scale disposal schemes are being enacted every day — often by the same politicians who declaim their love for the environment and public land.”

Legislative initiatives are receiving strong encouragement from the current Trump administration to parcel and sell off, trade or otherwise divest national public lands and put them into private hands, severing existing protections, means of preservation and ultimately public access. Although such current directives may lead to a new precedent of commoditization, they are part of a long and controversial history.

On April 23, historian and blog phenomenon Heather Cox Richardson wrote in her daily “Letters From an American” a warning that the Department of Agriculture (which administers the U.S. Forest Service) and the Bureau of Land Management (which is under the Department of the Interior) have been gearing up for a wholesale liquidation of the American commons.

“Today,” wrote Cox Richardson, “the White House under President Donald J. Trump celebrated Earth Day by announcing that the White House champions ‘opening more federal lands and waters for oil, gas and critical mineral extraction.’”

Cox Richardson pointed out that, in fact, public lands already benefit the nation by generating billions of dollars a year for the United States through tourism.

“Since the 1970s,” she wrote, “the right wing has come to see the public ownership of lands as an affront to the idea that individuals should be able to use the resources they believe God has put there for them to use.

“Developers have encouraged that ideology, for privatization of America’s Western lands has always meant that they ended up in the hands of a few wealthy individuals.”

The conservative political agenda outlined in Project 2025, she noted, calls for a giveaway to oil and gas and mining interests by “opening up more of our federal land to energy development, rolling back protections on federal lands, and selling off more land to private developers.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum made it clear in his January confirmation hearings, Cox Richardson wrote, “that he sees selling the public lands as a source of revenue, referring to them as ‘America’s balance sheet.’”

“We’ve got $36 trillion in debt,” Burgum said, as quoted by Cox Richardson, “but we never talk about the assets, and the assets are the land and minerals. The Interior Department has got close to 500 million acres of surface, 700 million acres of subsurface, and over 2 billion acres of offshore. That’s the balance sheet of America. I believe we ought to have a deep inventory of all the assets in America. We ought to understand … what [is] our assets: $100 trillion, $200 trillion? We could be in great shape as a country.”

Bipartisan support for public lands

The Trump-era initiative to monetize public lands hit a roadblock, however, after bipartisan support for public lands overwhelmed the direction Burgum and the Trump administration had fomented both as an ongoing policy directive and as described in the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill, which was voted in by Congress and signed into law by the president July 4.

A draft version of that bill had called for selling 0.5% to 0.75% of U.S. Forest Service and BLM lands in 11 Western states and for selling 0.25% to 0.5% of BLM lands within 5 miles of the border of a U.S. population center.

“A proposal to sell federal public lands,” Caitlyn Kim on Colorado Public Radio News reported June 29, “has officially been taken out of the Republicans’ spending and tax bill after facing strong pushback from hunters, fishermen, outdoor recreation users and, most importantly, Republicans in the U.S. Senate and House.”

U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the chief elected Republican advocate for the sell-off, announced the removal of the public lands divestiture from the bill, blaming the decision on the budget reconciliation process and explaining that he could not get a safeguard to guarantee that the land would be sold only to American families.

CPR News reported that Lee “said he continues to believe the federal government ‘owns far too much land’ that he said is mismanaged and that ‘massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there.’ He indicated that he wasn’t giving up altogether, adding that he would work with President Donald Trump to ‘put underutilized federal land to work for American families.’”

However, according to the CPR report, “the decision [to delete public-land sales] also came after other Senate Republicans from the West said they opposed the idea and would offer an amendment to get it taken out of the bill. Five House Republicans also said they would vote against the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill if it remained in.”

Colorado lawmakers celebrated the removal of public-land sales from the GOP bill as a defining endorsement for the value most Americans feel toward protecting the American commons. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “The American people — and our public lands — have won!”

CPR News reported that Neguse and Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.) had issued a joint statement opposing public-land sales in an acknowledgment of unity for protecting a key American legacy that crosses the aisles of Congress. “Republican or Democrat — representing red, purple or blue districts — one sentiment continues to ring true: Public lands are not for sale.”

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “This is a huge victory for Colorado and the West. Thank you to everyone who made their voice heard and fought back against this dangerous provision. America’s public lands belong to all of us.”

“Protecting public lands is the most nonpartisan issue in the country,” Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited, said in a statement quoted by CPR News. “This is certainly not the first attempt to privatize or transfer our public lands, and it won’t be the last. We must stay vigilant and defend the places we love to fish, hike, hunt and explore.”

Taking a stand on the land

Despite this most recent halt of public land sales, the threat is far from over, warns Blaeloch, whose 20-year advocacy mission before the Western Lands Project ceded its role to Wild Earth Guardians in 2016 was to “scrutinize public land trades, sales, giveaways and any project that would cede public land, and their impacts on habitat and wildlife, natural resources, land use and communities. The goal of Western Lands Project is to keep public lands public.”

“We are about to return to the Golden Age of land acquisitions for private benefit,” Blaeloch said in an Aspen Journalism interview in April. In her focused role as public lands defender, Blaeloch said, “We realized that the Forest Service and BLM conduct hundreds of land deals every year, mostly without public involvement. I like clarity and transparency, and I thought it was unfair that deals were being made without the public interest.”

Erica Rosenberg, a former president of Western Lands Project, concludes in the introduction to Blaeloch’s report: “Congressional processes threaten to trade away, sell or give away our public land heritage — piece by piece — through a shady world of back-room deals, special interests and cronyism.”

So, Blaeloch, digging into her background as a career environmental planner, has pushed back with the goal of making federal land management agencies accountable by tracking land deals, educating the public at the grassroots, and also by educating Congress on what has long been a veiled aspect of American land use on the federal level.

Free land for railroad and lumber industries

Blaeloch’s report for the Western Lands Project stated that the most opportune era in U.S. history for collusion in acquiring public lands dirt cheap or at no cost at all took place from the mid-1800s up to the early 1900s through manipulative deals benefitting large railroad interests and the fast-growing lumber industry.

“Between 1850 and 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the federal government granted 131 million acres of public land to railroad corporations as incentive for westward expansion. These railroad land grants comprised one of the largest categories of public land disposal in U.S. history, after cash sale, homestead grants to individuals, and grants to the states for education and other purposes.”

For example, Blaeloch reports, “the Northern Pacific Railroad, which was to construct its line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Tacoma, Washington, was granted 38.9 million acres, including 9.6 million acres in Washington state. Several other land grants were added to what would more than a century later become the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe Railroad, for an additional total of more than 47 million acres.”

These generous railroad land grants were typically given in alternating square miles extending out from the railroad lines and forming a “checkerboard” land-ownership pattern of public/private land that is still visible on many maps and to anyone who chances to gaze out the window of an airplane while flying over the clear-cut forests of the Pacific Northwest.

Land giveaways to railroads were originally intended to encourage Western settlement as the American frontier expanded. It was assumed that land along the railroad lines would become desirable, enabling the railroads and federal government to capitalize by selling their alternating public/private parcels to settlers who would benefit from nearby rail service.

“In fact,” writes Blaeloch, “the railroads kept much of their grant land, and the federal government designated many of its checkerboards as national forest. Nearly all of the railroad land ‘grants’ were in fact intended to be temporary transfers of public land that the railroads were supposed to sell in turn to ‘actual settlers’ to raise money for railroad construction.”

Some railroad companies kept their land grants even though they failed to build, and some transferred former public lands and the wealth they generated to cronies, including elected officials.

“By 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the public had grown disgusted with the scandals and waste flowing from the railroad land grants, and this particular brand of public land giveaway ceased. By this time, too, the public was increasingly concerned about having reached the limits of free land and resources, and there was great controversy around the rapid liquidation of the country’s forests.”

By the end of the 19th century, the debate between forest preservation and utilitarian wise use was at full pitch. Preservation was strongly advocated by Sierra Club founder John Muir and his disciples. Utilitarian wise use was advocated by Gifford Pinchot, the country’s first Forest Service chief under President Theodore Roosevelt. Timber and mining industries actively lobbied for Pinchot’s view of the land as commodity, countering Muir’s view of the natural landscape as a necessary and valid public benefit.

Despoiling the garden

In his 1982 book, “Westward in Eden: The Public Lands and the Conservation Movement,” author William K. Wyant, a former Washington correspondent for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, raises, as a popular conception, the idea of the land as ultimately exploitable: “The American has usually seen real estate as expendable,” he writes. “It is something of which there is assumed to be plenty more … somewhere else.”

When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, writes Wyant, the Republican mandate was to shrink government and its influences, and to cut regulations on industry. This afforded a propitious launch of the Sagebrush Rebellion, which advocated shifting federal lands in the West to the states. “The United States had at the outset an incomparable Garden of Eden to dress and keep, as the Old Testament phrases it,” wrote Wyant. “Its husbandry has been at sometimes profligate, greedy and short-sighted and at other times blessed with extraordinary vision.”

Wyant idealistically describes the continental United States as a vast and pristine wilderness, “a domain of incredible richness — virgin forests, great rivers, the prairies and high plains, the shining Rockies, the arid and sandy wastes and the golden Pacific shore. The early settlers found it majestic and unspoiled, and they plunged into it, defiant of restraints.”

But without restraints, the commons suffered immeasurable abuse and exploitation, as a statement from Pinchot made clear in the early 20th century: “Outside the tropics, American forests were the richest and most productive on Earth, and the best able to repay good management. But nobody had begun to manage any part of them with an eye to the future. On the contrary, the greatest, the swiftest, the most efficient and the most appalling wave of forest destruction in human history was then swelling to its climax in the United States; and the American people were glad of it.”

Rapacious companies such as logging giant Weyerhaeuser saw forested public lands not as cathedrals, as did Muir, but as wood lots. By 1974, cites Wyant, Weyerhaeuser owned outright more than 5.5 million acres, a holding bigger than the state of Massachusetts.

U.S. Sen. Gale McGee (1915-92) who served in Congress from 1959 to 1977 as one of the last Democrats to hail from Wyoming, in testimony in 1971, said, “Today, the once-great forests of our nation have been depleted to the point that would shame Paul

Bunyan. It is time to cease measuring the value of our public forests on the scale of board-feet of timber.”

Vast land giveaways were enabled by the 1862 Railroad Act, writes Wyant, when a number of private railroad companies were allocated $65 million in federal loans and handed a total 110 million acres of public domain. In 1864, an even more generous provision was made when the Northern Pacific Railroad, then building a 2,128-mile line from St. Paul to Tacoma received millions of acres of public lands, including about one-fourth of the state of North Dakota and 15% of Montana.

This largesse was coupled with political influence from railroad magnates who lobbied Congress for more land. Support for outrageous public behests also came from politicians who favored rail subsidies in exchange for locating lines in cities and towns that benefitted their constituents in blatant acts of patronage. Industry and business were in on the take at the expense of the commons.

“All in all,” writes Wyant, “Congress gave to the railroads an area nearly twice the size of Colorado and one-third as large as Alaska.” Another gift of the commons came to the railroads in the Forest Management Act of 1897, which allowed land-holders within newly designated and protected forest reserves to exchange, acre-for-acre, their holdings for lands that were outside the reserves.

Under this act, writes Wyant, rail barons were permitted to swap millions of acres of mountainous, desert, cutover or otherwise useless land for “in lieu” timber acreage of far greater value. The railroads then made deals with lumber companies by not only selling their holdings, but transporting for a profit the timber that was harvested from them. Loggers and railroads latched onto the mutual benefits of collusion in the exploitation of public lands, with no evident moral, ethical or ecological considerations.

After a hue and cry of protest from rising ranks of conservationists, the “in lieu” provision was repealed in 1905. However, eight years of rampant profiteering had already privatized huge chunks of the commons.

“In addition to the scars on the land,” writes Blaeloch, “the behavior pattern, too, was carried forward, and the companies established a paradigm that brought them enormous profits at the expense of the public interest, neatly disguised as ‘win-win’ deals. It is a pattern that shows itself time and again in land deals driven by politics, privilege and greed.”

A regional comparison is necessary to grasp the scale of land acquisitions by logging companies: The White River National Forest covers 2.3 million acres, one of the largest forests in the United States. The Emmerson family, which owns and operates Sierra Pacific Industries, a family legacy company since 1949 that logs usable lumber after forest fires and sells it to lumber retailers, owns 2.4 million acres in three Western states: California, Oregon and Washington. How did one family carve out of the American commons acreage greater than the largest national forest in Colorado? Timber.

Still, Wyant surmises, rising ranks of professional and educated conservationists have achieved national influence in the aftermath of public lands feeding frenzies. “An impressive machinery for the defense of the environment and public lands has been built,” he concludes. “Until it is more firmly in place and has the steady acceptance of the American people, we shall owe a heavy debt to the corporal’s guard of environmental lawyers and professional conservationists who man the ramparts while others sleep.”

Congress, freewheeling land deals and FLPMA

The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. — U.S. Constitution, Article IV, section 3, clause 2 (Property Clause)

As environmentalists and public land activists have become aware of the chipping away of public lands through land sales and exchanges, they realized that deals were being made through Congress with questionable legitimacy.

“Congress members,” writes Blaeloch, “were free to wheel, deal, carve up and give away public lands with no rules to hinder them.”

Although some deals were negotiated with bipartisan agreement, many were split down party lines. Geography has also played a role. Blaeloch reports that in the area of protecting public lands, “Republicans favor less of it than Democrats. As a party, Democrats have a far better record on public land protection, but the more consequential split is between Western and Eastern politicians, with easterners being more protective than westerners where public lands are in far greater supply.”

“However, it is by no means just ideology or geography that inspires congressional land deals,” writes Blaeloch. “Frequently, the bottom line is the direct, pragmatic opportunity to reward friends or curry political favor through the gift of public lands.”

In reaction to the gradual expansion of a national conservation ethic, Congress in 1976 passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), which gave broad authority to the BLM and Forest Service to implement land transactions by ideally providing a more rational, consistent and transparent process.

“It was not until 1976,” writes Blaeloch, “with the passage of FLPMA, that Congress officially closed the frontier, declaring that ‘it is the policy of the United States that the public lands be retained in federal ownership, unless as a result of the land use planning procedure provided for in this Act, it is determined that disposal of a particular parcel will serve the national interest.’ FLPMA established procedures, primarily for the BLM, to identify areas that should be retained for conservation purposes.”

According to an artificial intelligence search, FLPMA “mandates a multiple-use and sustained-yield approach, balancing resource extraction and commercial activities with conservation of natural and cultural resources. The act requires the BLM to periodically inventory public lands and their resources to develop management plans that balance various uses. FLPMA also requires the BLM to coordinate with state and local governments and provide for meaningful citizen involvement in land use planning such as land exchanges that allow the BLM to trade federal land for other land of potentially greater public value. FLPMA also mandates the protection of scientific, scenic, historic, ecological, and other resources, and the management of areas like wilderness study areas and Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC).”

Such managerial responsibilities provide oversight, explains Blaeloch, making land transfers more transparent and, as a result of increased public and administrative input, more complex. Many transfers are undertaken to eliminate private inholdings within the public domain, thereby consolidating larger areas of contiguous public land for more effective management. Other benefits include protecting watersheds or other sensitive lands and to serve other genuine public interest purposes.

Regarding the giving away or selling of public lands, writes Blaeloch, federal land agencies have been limited in their authority and they are not allowed to give it away. “By contrast, members of Congress may approve sales or giveaways of any size or nature, limited only by what they believe they can justify.” She warns, however, that congressional exchanges are often subject to little scrutiny or public involvement, with vague language in the FLPMA establishing a guideline that land disposals must “serve the national interest.” Defining “national interest” is key to the future of public lands.

Regarding land transfers, Blaeloch writes: “Perhaps their most basic flaw is that most are designed to serve narrow special interests, even where they purport to serve a greater good. It is now well established that land exchanges and sales implemented by the public land agencies — that is, through the administrative process — can be ill-conceived, badly executed and damaging to the public interest.”

One safeguard is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which provides strict guidelines by requiring environmental analysis and disclosure, as well as opportunities for citizen input. FLPMA dictates that land exchanges must serve the public interest and yield equal value to both or multiple sides in the transaction.

The following protections are required under NEPA and FLPMA against specious land exchanges:

• Public notification to ensure that the affected communities are aware of the proposal and its scope.

• Environmental analysis of the trade’s impacts, including the impact on public lands that would be traded away.

• Analysis of a range of alternatives for the exchange including “no action,” different exchange configurations, outright purchase of private lands, and development restrictions on land traded to the private party.

• Analysis of the ecological and other values on lands that would come into public ownership.

• Formal opportunities for the public to respond to and ask for changes in the proposal, including public hearings and comment periods. In addition, the agency is required to respond to substantive comments and incorporate legitimate concerns into the proposal.

• A “public interest determination” compiled by the agency that outlines the reasons/justification for the trade.

• The right to appeal the decision if it is not in the public interest and/or the right to challenge the adequacy of the NEPA analysis.

• Public disclosure of appraisal information once the agency’s “preferred alternative” is identified and before the land deeds are transferred.

Blaeloch cautions that the administrative route to land sales and exchanges provides a clearly delineated, predictable process. By contrast, she lists the reasons why the congressional route guarantees none of the safeguards provided in statutes and regulations:

•A member of Congress can put any kind of land deal he or she desires into a piece of legislation, and none of the provisions listed above need to be included.

• Public notification is not required; citizens learn about a legislated land trade by luck; by the grace of the proponent or congressional sponsor; in the news; or by searching the congressional website.

• Environmental analysis is occasionally required but is often truncated and far more often omitted altogether.

• Opportunities for public input are available through contacting members of Congress or submitting written or oral testimony for congressional hearings.

• There is no right to appeal a land bill. Citizens cannot file an appeal against or sue Congress. In rare cases, it is possible to sue the agency over its implementation of a legislated exchange if it does not comply with the legislation that directed it.

• There is no requirement for the disclosure of appraisal information. A “summary” of appraisal data may be made available; otherwise, complete appraisal information for a congressional land trade is probably available only after deeds have changed hands — assuming appraisals were conducted in the first place.

“Custom-written bills can provide the proponents with special provisions and guarantees they would not be able to secure through the agencies,” writes Blaeloch. “Proponents can manipulate the appraisal standards, bypass environmental analysis, set an absolute deadline for the transfer of deeds, and add custom provisions that are beneficial to the private parties. This emphasizes why it is a civic duty for American citizens to become involved in any decisions regarding public lands, whether management or transactions.”

Key events in the historic transfer of public lands to private hands (from “Carving Up the Commons,” published in 2009 by the Western Lands Project).

• The Land Act of 1796 authorized public auctions of federal land.

• The General Land Office was created in 1812 to administer the disposal of public lands.

• By 1820, Congress had passed 24 acts granting to settler-squatters the right of preemption, allowing them to buy land without competitive bidding.

• A series of railroad land grants between 1850 and 1870 allowed several dozen private railroads to acquire and sell public lands in order to raise capital to build the nation’s railroad and telegraph systems.

• The 1862 Homestead Act authorized settlers to claim 160 acres of any land subject to preemption, and later to any unsurveyed land. The homestead was granted free for a nominal filing fee, but title was not transferred until the land had been settled and cultivated for three years.

• The General Mining Law of 1872 allowed anyone to file a mineral claim on public lands and receive a patent to the land for $5 per acre or less. Under this law, more than 3 million acres of federal land have been patented. The law is still on the books.

• The Desert Lands Act, Timber Culture Act, and Timber and Stone Act — all of which were advanced in the 1870s — made more land available to settlers and industries.

• By the early 20th century, the federal government had granted or sold more than 1 billion acres, or 70% of the continental United States.",https://aspenjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Olympic_NF_-_Clearcut_patterns_on_Shelton_RD_WA_1957_21851824068-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 00:58:04.344228

Individual and corporate tax rates stay put, qualified small business stock (QSBS) and qualified opportunity zones (QOZ) rules are fortified, and domestic research and development (R&D) expenditures are once again fully deductible.

This article highlights the most important considerations for individual owners and investors.

What Changed and What Didn’t

The OBBBA keeps the 37 percent top individual rate, 21 percent corporate rate and 20 percent capital gains rate, while making Section 199A permanent and leaving carried interest unchanged.

It restores 100 percent of bonus depreciation (for personal property and some real estate placed in service after January 19, 2025) and full domestic R&D expensing (retroactive to 2025, or to 2022 for smaller businesses). Interest deductibility returns to an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) cap, but capitalized interest remains subject to Section 163(j) after 2025.

Excess business loss limits and the ban on miscellaneous itemized deductions are permanent, while several clean energy credits are phasing down. Workarounds related to state and local tax (SALT) deductions and the pass-through entity tax (PTET) deduction continue to be allowed.

Choice of Entity in a QSBS World

For tax planning, entity choice is still very important. LLCs provide one level of tax, flexible allocations, profits interests, and seller‑ and buyer-friendly asset sale treatment, whereas C corporations are compelling where a QSBS election is to be made. OBBBA’s QSBS upgrades strengthen that case for scalable, venture‑style or small businesses.

Hybrid stacks (e.g., an LLC parent owning a QSBS eligible C corporation) can preserve tax effective incentive equity at the LLC while positioning operating stock for QSBS. Fit depends on investor mix, exit path, projected future taxable income and distributions, and compensation strategy.

QSBS: Bigger Caps, Larger Companies and Faster Partial Exclusions

QSBS remains a powerful incentive. For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA:

introduces partial gain exclusions for earlier exits: 50 percent if held for three years, 75 percent if held for four years and 100 percent if held for five years.

raises the per‑issuer gain exclusion cap to the greater of (a) $15 million (indexed in 2027) or (b) 10x the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in the stock.

increases the issuer gross assets cap to $75 million (which increases every year based on inflation).

Fundamentals still apply regarding original issuance in a C corporation engaged in a qualified trade or business. Execution details matter — gifts and partnership distributions of QSBS stock can preserve status, but contributions to partnership of QSBS stock generally do not. Contemporaneous redemptions can taint purported QSBS issuances. Whether a husband and wife are treated as one or two taxpayers is still somewhat unclear. Additionally, state conformity is uneven (e.g., California does not recognize QSBS). If QSBS is a goal, companies should consider converting to a C corporation to start the clock for future appreciation.

QOZs: Permanence, a Rolling Deferral and a Rural Boost

QOZ is now permanent with updated mechanics. Qualifying gains invested in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) receive:

a five‑year rolling deferral starting at investment, with a flat 10 percent basis step‑up if the investment is held for the full five years (30 percent for qualified rural opportunity funds, or QROFs).

a full FMV basis step‑up on sale after 10 years (eliminating gain on appreciation).

a 30‑year ceiling; basis steps up at year 30 and any appreciation after 30 years is taxable.

The QOZ program under the OBBBA regime applies to amounts invested in QOFs after December 31, 2026, but may create a “dead zone” of investment in QOFs between 2025-2026 because investments made under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) QOZ program prior to December 31, 2026, will recognize any deferred gain on December 31, 2026. Taxpayers should coordinate exit dates within the 180‑day window and expect enhanced reporting and penalties. Rural projects may benefit from the higher tax-basis step up and relaxed improvement thresholds.

Preparing for and Structuring an Exit

Begin sale prep early, including accounting and personal assets clean‑up, sell‑side quality of earnings (QoE), contracts/consents, intellectual property and compensation, and business restructuring, since traditional processes run as long as six to nine months.

Consider that buyers prefer asset deals, while sellers favor equity sales. Flow‑through sellers can often accommodate asset sales efficiently; however, C corporation sellers of appreciated businesses usually cannot without double tax. Representations and warranties (R&W) insurance can bridge equity deal risk.

Tax‑deferred rollovers can frequently be achieved via capital contributions to partnerships or corporations. Installment sales can also defer tax (watch out for recapture exclusions and interest on deferred taxes). If QSBS applies, sell stock rather than assets to preserve the full benefit of the exclusion. A parent LLC can facilitate reps/indemnities while holding corporate stock.

State Tax Developments to Watch: The Illinois Shift

Illinois now has adopted legislation to source gains on sales of S corporation shares and interests in partnerships (other than investment partnerships) to Illinois if the entity is taxable there, using an average of the entity’s Illinois apportionment factors for the sale year and prior two years. In a departure from prior commercial domicile sourcing, nonresidents disposing of interests in S corporations and partnerships doing business in Illinois may owe Illinois tax on exit gains.

Practical Takeaways for Individuals

For business owners, founders and investors, three themes dominate:

Align entity choice with exit goals: If QSBS is plausible, test a C corporate path; otherwise, LLCs often maximize after‑tax flexibility, and hybrids can bridge both.

Consider deferring capital gains through the updated QOZ program, tax-deferred rollovers and installment sales.

In conclusion, while the OBBBA offers certainty, it rewards rigorous structuring and early planning to maximize after‑tax outcomes.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-11/IRS%20tax%20forms%20capital%20gains%20income%20tax%20forms%20internal%20revenue%20fiance%20investing.jpg.webp?itok=d999y8gK,N,,2025-11-15 22:58:47.811411

Like zombies rising from the grave to devour the living, old coal power plants have begun to shake off the dust, adding to the burden of skyrocketing electricity costs. Not to worry. They won’t last long. The so-called national “energy emergency” that promised new life to the nation’s fleet of aging coal power plants is already evaporating under the weight of new sodium-ion batteries and other economical energy storage systems that take full advantage of the nation’s abundant, economical supply of wind and solar energy.

The Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Solution

By now, everyone knows that wind and solar — especially solar — are the fastest, most accessible, and most economical domestic energy resources available in the US today, with energy storage systems adding to the mix.

That explains why renewable energy has been the overwhelming choice for new capacity additions in recent years. The numbers don’t lie. In the first half of this year, for example, renewable energy resources accounted for 93% of new capacity additions to the US grid, for a total of 30.2 gigawatts, with solar and energy storage projects accounting for 83%.

All else being equal, wind and solar capacity additions will accelerate as energy storage systems drop in cost. The first half of that equation depends on which way the winds of federal energy policy blow, but the second half is a matter of innovation and investor engagement, and that is where a fresh burst of cleantech activity has already materialized.

In recent years, researchers have been focusing on sodium-ion technology as a more economical alternative compared to the familiar lithium-ion formula for battery energy storage systems (see more sodium-ion battery background here). Advocates for a sodium-ion future suffered a setback earlier this year when the high-profile US startup Natron shut down operations at its North Carolina factory and Michigan headquarters. However, other sodium-ion innovators have already picked up the torch.

The Peak Energy Sodium-Ion Solution

Among the torch bearers is the US energy storage firm Peak Energy. The startup launched only two years ago but it came into the sodium-ion scene with a head start in experience among senior executives, including from Tesla and Apple as well as the leading global energy storage firm Powin.

Peak Energy surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar when it burst out of stealth mode in October of 2023 with a business model based on vertical integration and a cost-cutting passive cooling system, and they hit the ground running. In July of 2024, Peak nailed down $55 million in Series A funding, spearheaded by the Xora Innovation branch of Temasek along with existing investor Eclipse and strategic partner TDK Ventures. Newcomers Lachy Groom, Tishman Speyer, TechEnergy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and DETV-Scania Invest also supported the Series A round.

“Peak Energy claims that its sodium-ion battery technology can offer advantages in cost, supply chain security, scale, and safety over lithium-ion, the industry’s current default battery storage choice. The funding is also expected to lay the groundwork for a domestic, giga-scale sodium-ion battery factory slated to open in 2027,” Mercom Capital reported last year.

Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Coal Power Plants

One advantage of sodium-ion technology over other formulas is its scalability, and Peak already aims to put that to the test. Earlier this year the company launched its grid-scale sodium-ion system into the market, and last week it announced plans to build the largest sodium-ion BESS in the world, in partnership with the up-and-coming independent power producer Jupiter Power.

The initial agreement calls for a 720-megawatt sodium-ion system to be delivered to Jupiter in 2027. With Jupiter holding an option for another 4,000 megawatts between 2028 and 2030, Peak estimates that the total value of the contract could top $500 million.

As for what sparked Jupiter’s interest in a new energy storage platform when the old one is working so well, that’s a good question. There is always room for improvement. In addition to its existing portfolio, Jupiter has a 12,000-megawatt pipeline brewing in the US, and Peak Energy promises to deliver more bang for the buck.

“Peak’s sodium-ion batteries promise less degradation over their lifetime and reduced operations and maintenance costs compared to lithium-ion systems on the market today,” Peak explains, putting the 20-year improvement at 30% compared to other systems.

“Lower system degradation can also reduce augmentation requirements, meaning operators will not have to add additional battery units or components over a project’s lifetime in order to maintain storage capacity over the project’s lifespan,” Peak adds.

Peak also draws attention to its passive cooling system, which enables it to bypass fabrication, maintenance, and repair costs typical of lithium-ion systems while reducing auxiliary power costs by 97%.

Zombie Coal Power Plants Rise From The Dead To Attack The Living

Against the backdrop of falling costs for wind, solar, and utility-scale energy storage systems, it’s difficult to see how any coal power plant in the US can survive much longer. The coal industry was already bending under the weight of low-cost natural gas in the early 2000,’s and now renewables and energy storage have added to the pressure.

In addition, coal power does not necessarily meet the oversimplified, under-defined “reliability” standard set forth by US President Donald Trump’s own American Energy Dominance policy. The 932-megawatt Sandy Creek coal power plant in Texas, for example, suffered a catastrophic failure in April and restoration is not expected until March of 2027.

The pace of coal retirements, though, is complicated by existing grid conditions and rising electricity demand among other factors. In February the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported that the US grid would drop 8.1 gigawatts of coal power this year in scheduled retirements, including some of the nation’s largest: Intermountain Power in Utah (1.8 gigawatts), JH Campbell in Michigan (1.33 GW), and Brandon Shores in Maryland (1.27 GW). However, by February the wheels were already in motion to push the Brandon Shores closure back to 2029. The new date was reached under an agreement between the plant operator Talen Energy, the Maryland Public Service Commission, local ratepayers and utilities, and the Sierra Club among other stakeholders, pending a major upgrade to the regional transmission system.

In addition, coal retirements are not necessarily replaced by renewables. The Intermountain capacity, for example, will be replaced in part by a new gas power plant.

In May US Energy Secretary Chris Wright also shook things up when he summarily ordered the JH Campbell facility to keep running 90 days past its scheduled retirement date of May 31, an order later extended to November despite the extra costs.

The JH Campbell order is just one piece of the coal puzzle. Last spring the Energy Department announced that coal projects will share in a new federal low-cost loan pot of $200 billion, and in October Energy Secretary Wright announced a new round of $625 million in funding specifically aimed at coal, including $375 million set aside to recommission and retrofit old power plants.

Coal industry stakeholders have begun to respond to the new incentives, but one thing is for sure. The sun will rise and the wind will blow long after the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time. When he does, a new generation of reliable, economical energy storage systems will be ready to restore the momentum to the renewable energy transition in the US.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sodium-battery-energy-storage-PNNL.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 19:01:43.829647

But one small program, a $25 million plan to install rooftop solar panels on schools is giving some advocates hope. Others say it is only a tiny step, far too small to fix the state’s long-standing clean-energy gridlock.

In Carlisle, a town in conservative central Pennsylvania, solar power has become surprisingly non-controversial. Superintendent Colleen Friend is leading a project to install solar panels at an elementary school. She said she faced almost no political pushback.

Her district received $252,000 in funding from the state’s Solar for Schools program. The law passed last year with rare bipartisan support. The program just received another year of funding in a budget agreement announced Wednesday.

But the celebration comes with a warning: Pennsylvania is still falling behind on clean-energy progress, and advocates say rooftop solar could be a powerful but underused tool.

A Lone Success in a Stalled Energy Landscape

Pennsylvania has long been known for coal and natural gas, and debates over fracking and joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) have frozen most climate legislation.

But Solar for Schools broke through:

88 schools applied, requesting $88 million — more than three times the available budget.

73 schools received a total of $22.6 million.

Demand shows strong interest across both red and blue communities.

Flora Cardoni, deputy director at PennEnvironment, called the program a “clear success” and said many more schools would install solar if funding expanded.

Why Distributed Solar Stands Out

Distributed solar — small systems on roofs, homes, schools, and businesses — offers several advantages:

1. It avoids grid bottlenecks

Large solar farms must wait years for approval from PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator.

Rooftop systems do not face that delay.

2. It can appeal to conservatives

Deregulation and “local control” messaging help win bipartisan support.

3. It creates more jobs

A state analysis shows rooftop solar would create 3–5 jobs per megawatt, compared to fewer than 2.5 jobs for large utility-scale solar.

4. It provides big savings

In a new PennEnvironment study, Pennsylvania’s 5,000 school buildings could:

Save $342 million over system lifetimes

Power the equivalent of 187,000 homes

Cut emissions equal to 300,000 cars

Distributed Solar Potential (Table)

Benefit Area Impact Job creation 32,000+ potential jobs if rooftop solar reaches 35% of state mix School savings $342M lifetime savings across 5,000 schools Carbon cuts Equal to removing 300,000 cars from the road Rural benefits Rural counties save more per school than big urban counties

Barriers Are Rising — and Time Is Short

Despite strong interest, new challenges could stall progress:

Federal incentives are ending

Many districts planned to pair state grants with federal tax credits covering 30–50% of costs.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled those credits back. They expire next year.

Utilities have long wait times

Solar installers report 1–3 year delays for connecting rooftop solar in areas served by PECO and PPL.

Construction deadlines are tight

Schools must start construction by next summer or risk losing funding.

Some districts are asking for new cost analyses as federal incentives disappear.

A Bipartisan Opening — or a One-Time Win?

Solar for Schools passed with:

10 out of 101 House Republicans

21 out of 28 Senate Republicans

All Democrats

State Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, the program’s sponsor, spent months touring the state and focusing on economic benefits, not climate messaging. She also won support from labor unions.

Advocates hoped this success could open the door for more distributed-solar legislation. But those hopes dimmed once the state’s budget deal removed Pennsylvania from the RGGI program and left major clean-energy bills untouched.

Stalled Bills

Community solar bill — passed the House, stuck in Senate

Solar on municipal buildings — stuck in House committee

Lightning Plan bills — none advanced in the budget deal

Some Republicans, including Rep. Craig Williams, support solar but also push for fossil-fuel expansion. Williams argues the state must adopt an “all of the above” strategy to meet rising energy demand.

Net metering — how solar owners are credited for excess power — is also under debate. Solar advocates worry that proposed changes could make rooftop systems less affordable.

The idea is that if we can dig deeply and cost-effectively enough, geothermal energy could be available, abundant, and financially feasible practically anywhere on Earth.
As a result, enhanced geothermal energy startups are currently generating a lot of buzz.
“His administration is embracing geothermal energy, which is primed for a very American boom,” the Atlantic reported earlier this year.
That’s a huge figure, clocking in at more than three times the current output of the nation’s nuclear power sector – the most productive nuclear power sector in the world.","Geothermal energy is becoming Big Tech’s newest darling. Silicon Valley is upending its deep pockets into enhanced geothermal startups in a bid to stay one step ahead of the massive energy demand growth trend being spurred by the AI boom. Geothermal boasts key advantages over leading clean energy technologies, most notably the fact that it’s a constant, baseload clean energy source and that it’s one of vanishingly few zero-carbon alternatives with broad bipartisan support in the United States. As a result, this relatively niche and nascent technology may finally be ready for its close-up.

Until very recently, geothermal energy was only viable in geologically anomalous places where heat from the Earth’s core naturally made its way up to the Earth’s crust – such as through hot springs and geysers. As such, thermally active countries like Iceland were able to meaningfully integrate geothermal energy into their national energy mixes, but very few other countries and regions could. As such, geothermal accounts for less than 1% of the world’s energy mix today, and just 0.4% of the United States’ utility-scale energy generation.

But all of that is changing as ‘enhanced geothermal’ exits theoretical modelling and enters the real world. Enhanced geothermal borrows drilling technologies from the oil and gas industry’s hydraulic fracturing sector, and is even exploring borrowing tech from nuclear fusion to essentially melt away layers of rock to reach greater and greater depths. The idea is that if we can dig deeply and cost-effectively enough, geothermal energy could be available, abundant, and financially feasible practically anywhere on Earth.

As a result, enhanced geothermal energy startups are currently generating a lot of buzz. One such venture, Houston-based Fervo Energy, is backed by Bill Gates and Google, among other high-powered investors. Fervo has already secured the largest-ever commercial contract for geothermal power, having inked an agreement to provide 320 megawatts of power to Southern California Edison utility.

The firm has proven the efficacy of its enhanced approach at a pilot plant in Nevada, and is now “dramatically” scaling up its operations at a Utah plant and readying itself for commercial operations in 2026, all while showing a “70% reduction in drilling time year on year (see chart) while achieving high temperatures and flow rates” according to a recent report from The Economist, which proclaims that “geothermal energy looks set to go from niche to necessary.”

The United States’ public sector seems to be just as bullish as the private sector. The Trump administration has backed the sector’s development and refrained from slashing funding for geothermal in the same ways it has for other clean energy technologies. “His administration is embracing geothermal energy, which is primed for a very American boom,” the Atlantic reported earlier this year.

The Department of Energy recently revised its outlook to increase geothermal’s projected share of the national energy mix, predicting that by 2050, geothermal technologies could provide up to 300 gigawatts of energy. That’s a huge figure, clocking in at more than three times the current output of the nation’s nuclear power sector – the most productive nuclear power sector in the world. The scale of that projected growth is hard to overstate – today, geothermal produces less than four gigawatts in the United States.

Global geothermal numbers are also set to rise in a dramatic fashion. The International Energy Agency, too, has revised its long-term forecast to give geothermal a larger slice of the pie, reporting that the technology’s global potential is over 800 gigawatts by 2050, up from 15 gigawatts today. This kind of growth would make a genuine impact in global energy and emissions trends, and could be pivotal to avoiding an AI-driven global energy crunch. A report released earlier this year by New York-based research firm the Rhodium Group estimates that “geothermal could economically meet up to 64% of expected demand growth by the early 2030s.”

The Jays’ struggles over the last two games of the series at home was an apt analogy for the climate crisis, with G7 ministers gathered nearby.

They also fell short.

The failure of government environment and energy leaders from around the world, and the particular shortcomings of the hosts, left stakeholders frustrated. As has become the theme in many corners of governance globally, political leaders are clearly more preoccupied with economic hardships that are driving decision making around the world right now.

The G7 conference ignored decisive action required to confront the forces driving the climate change crisis, and like their boss, Prime Minister Mark Carney, his two ministers seem resigned to the new political reality: the environment, for now, is taking a back seat to questionable decisions in the name of bolstering a fragile global economy.

The tone for the series of meetings was set early, when U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright dismissed global climate efforts at a press conference: “We need to stop praying to the climate change God that justifies destroying our energy systems, driving up energy prices and scaring children.”

On the same day, Hurricane Melissa, which had formed on October 21, reached peak intensity, becoming the third-most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record and the strongest tropical cyclone of 2025.

It rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a major Category 4 hurricane in just a day, fueled by Caribbean Sea temperatures around 1.5 degrees Celsius above average and unusually deep heat layers that provided a continuous source of warm water.

Making landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane, Melissa brought unprecedented destruction.

Wright spoke of “scaring children,” yet it was children who paid the ultimate price of climate inaction: 10 lost their lives in Haiti’s southern town of Petit-Goâve when a river burst its banks, sweeping away homes (damaging 450 houses and killing 43 people), roads, and farmland in the relentless floodwaters.

Fueled by the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea, Melissa rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 hurricane by the time it made landfall in Jamaica.

In the Lesser Antilles, gusts reaching 45 miles per hour battered Barbados, Saint Lucia, and Martinique. Puerto Rico endured torrential rains that displaced hundreds.

The Dominican Republic faced widespread flooding that left 1.1 million people without clean water and destroyed vital infrastructure.

Cuba suffered nearly one million damaged homes and 700,000 people were forced into shelters. The Bahamas, Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast also felt Melissa’s ominous reach through severe flooding, power outages and destructive winds.

Hurricane Melissa has claimed over 50 lives and forced more than a million people across the Caribbean from their homes, with Jamaica bearing the brunt as 2.8 million residents faced devastating winds and floods; by November 3, at least 32 deaths had been confirmed, 94 people treated for injuries and over 7,000 remained in shelters.

But it was Jamaica that bore the worst: towns submerged, communication lines down, and up to 90 percent of homes in some parishes destroyed. At least 32 people were killed, and more than a half million were left without power.

The remnants of Melissa also passed near Newfoundland, and gradually weakened over the next few days until dissipating on November 4, southeast of Iceland, impacting nearly 6 million people in total, according to the United Nations.

The storm was yet another display of natural forces at play, and a stark warning of the risks posed by a warming world.

The atmospheric and ocean conditions that enabled this explosive intensification were made six times more likely by climate change, which also amplified the storm’s extreme rainfall by 16 percent and increased maximum wind speeds by seven percent, a recent study by the World Weather Attribution detailed.

In response, G7 nations have advanced efforts on extreme weather prediction, preparedness and response, building on the Kananaskis Wildfire Charter introduced at the G7 meeting in Alberta in June, a direct result of Canada alone experiencing over 6,000 wildfires in 2025, which burned more than 8.3 million hectares and made it the country’s second-worst wildfire season on record.

In June, the U.S. National Interagency Coordination Center deployed federal firefighting crews to help combat wildfires in Manitoba under a cross-border assistance agreement between the two countries that has been in place since 1982.

The member nations also discussed plans to strategically deploy public resources and mobilize private finance for climate and environmental solutions, targeting vulnerable nations, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), while fostering sustainable growth at home.

These measures, though welcomed, arrived too late to fully address the cascading system-wide planetary climate crises engulfing communities all around the world.

The Earth’s oceans are experiencing multiple massive shocks, with coral reef destruction devastating marine food chains, chemical imbalance altering the very nature of the water and temperature changes impacting entire climatic weather systems.

Ground and water surface temperatures are changing the way food is grown, how cities can be inhabited and the cost of delivering basic human services.

Air temperature and quality is changing the way we travel, breathe and survive in a rapidly changing atmosphere (India reported 1.7 million deaths from air pollution in 2022 alone). Flooding, wildfires and other extreme weather events in areas that seldom saw such devastation, now occur multiple times a year in the same places.

Communities in Jamaica are still reeling from the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. On October 29, the World Food Programme launched an urgent appeal for $74 million to deliver life-saving assistance to up to 1.1 million people across the Caribbean.

If you do a simple Google search for the reason behind climate change or our warming planet, this is the result: “The number one reason for the planet's warming is human activity, specifically the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases large amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, leading to rising global temperatures.”

In 2016, the G7 countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, made a commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2025.

Have they met that goal? No.

Was there a clear plan discussed at the G7 energy and environment ministers’ meeting to meet the deadline? No.

“The conversation that we had in the room were very much focused on a few different issues,” Dabrusin told The Pointer, citing discussions around circular economies, disaster preparedness and protecting water and ecosystems, while not answering the question directly.

The oil and gas program manager for Environmental Defence called the answer “disappointing.”

These are “the ministers of the most advanced economies in the world, and this (is the) commitment that they've made to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, and here we are waiting still,” Aly Hyder Ali told The Pointer.

“Instead of ending subsidies, they're writing bigger and bigger checks to polluters. The idea that the environment ministers can't think of one effort to address the climate crisis is just bogus. It's completely unacceptable to not have any sort of plan to follow through on the commitment to end.”

Among the meeting’s key outcomes was the Toronto Action Plan on Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency, a three-year roadmap (2025–2028) targeting waste-heavy industries like plastics, textiles and critical minerals. The plan promotes reuse, recycling and resource efficiency as ideas that could unlock $4.5 trillion (USD) in global economic growth by 2030 while cutting pollution and reducing strain on ecosystems, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The second major framework, the G7 Water Coalition Workplan, launched under Italy’s 2024 G7 presidency and continued under Canada’s (which will soon end), focuses on protecting freshwater systems and addressing the escalating global water crisis.

It emphasizes integrated water resource management, nature-based solutions, and the use of artificial intelligence and remote sensing for monitoring and resilience, with a commitment to collaborate with Indigenous communities, civil society and local governments for more equitable governance.

At a press conference at the G7 meeting, Lee Zeldin, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), also spoke about the importance of protecting the shared freshwater resources between Canada and the United States including the Great Lakes, which supply drinking water to more than 40 million people, including ten percent of the U.S. population and 30 percent of Canadians.

Together, the five Great Lakes contain 21 percent of the world’s surface freshwater by volume, and 84 percent of the surface freshwater in North America.

But the same resources have been jeopardized by the Trump administration’s funding cuts to Great Lakes research.

Earlier this year, U.S. president Donald Trump’s budget proposals and administrative actions targeted agencies such as the EPA and NOAA, leading to job losses at key research labs, the halt of critical monitoring programs, and growing concerns about the ability to track algal blooms, invasive species, and water quality.

When asked whether the administration planned to restore the funding, Zeldin deflected, blaming Senate Democrats for recent government shutdown threats. He claimed that Congressional Republicans had “voted 13 times” for level funding, accusing Democrats of stalling appropriations that would keep EPA employees “working and getting paid.”

Zeldin, who represents New York’s First Congressional District, home to the Long Island Sound and other major estuary programs, insisted the administration did not want to see cuts implemented.

“I do not want to see that cut has to get implemented…we want people to be inside the office…we want them doing these important jobs. We want them to receive their paycheque, and we do not want them disrupted by this shutdown,” he told The Pointer, his comments offering little clarity on whether Great Lakes research funding would actually be reinstated.

Ottawa also made its stance clear on freshwater protection in the latest federal budget by keeping the Canada Water Agency intact after leaked messages, first reported by the National Post, suggested major cuts were on the table, though the commitment rings hollow with the agency set to lose $5 million over four years under a maintenance-level budget.

With 20 percent of the world’s freshwater, Canada has immense responsibility for safeguarding its lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands, but the country’s water systems are in crisis. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) warns that all 167 Canadian sub-watersheds are under threat, with nearly three-quarters showing moderate to high impacts from climate change. In a 2017 report, WWF Canada found that all but 41 sub-watersheds out of 167 have seen moderate or high impacts from climate change. “Even small shifts in temperature and the precipitation that replenishes rivers can have a large impact on ecosystem dynamics, including change in water levels and rate of flow,” the report stated. It noted 53 sub-watersheds were found to have “high or very high levels of disturbance,” with southern watersheds facing greater stress due to higher road densities and the concentration of Canada’s agriculture and industry in the region.

“From a climate perspective, this G7 Ministerial could have been an email,” Climate Action Network Canada (CAN-Rac) executive director Caroline Brouillette said.

“Canada was negotiating in difficult circumstances, given the United States’ climate-destructive presence. But diplomacy requires strategy, and we hope Minister Dabrusin finds one for Canada before COP30—and works with civil society to land it.”

Brouillette’s words carry weight: Wright blamed climate change worries for driving energy prices up, when in actuality, it is wars, fossil fuel subsidies and market distortions that inflate costs and lock in dependence on polluting energy sources.

“In 2023, total G7 fossil fuel subsidies rose by more than US $40 billion above 2022 levels, which in turn were a large increase over preceding years,” an International Institute for Sustainable Development report highlighted.

“These increases were driven by countries’ responses to the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”

Fossil fuel subsidies among G7 nations reached a record US$282 billion in 2023, up 297 percent from US$71 billion in 2016. In 2023, Germany had the highest fossil fuel subsidies among G7 members (USD 83 billion), followed by Japan (USD 70 billion), France (USD 38 billion), Italy (USD 35 billion), the United Kingdom (USD 34 billion), the United States (USD 17.8 billion), and Canada (USD 3.4 billion).

(International Institute for Sustainable Development)

By continuing to prop up fossil fuel consumption instead of investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and support for vulnerable households, G7 nations are not only undermining climate action but also perpetuating price volatility, the problem they claim to address.

Approximately one-seventh of the world's primary energy is now sourced from renewable technologies.

(Our World in Data)

If the final remarks by Ministers Dabrusin and Hodgson are any indication, the summit largely wrapped up focusing on energy security, artificial intelligence, and critical minerals investments only.

Among the announcements, 26 new investments, partnerships, and measures were introduced to accelerate $6.4 billion in critical minerals projects, alongside up to $20.2 million in support for international research collaborations and a commitment to advance standards-based markets.

Ministers endorsed the G7 Energy and AI Work Plan to integrate AI responsibly into energy systems, build trust in digital technologies, promote responsible growth, and issued a Call to Action on Enhancing Energy Security, addressing infrastructure modernization, supply chain security, gas market stabilization, and the first comprehensive statement on Nuclear and Fusion Energy with responsible waste management.

What stood out among a flurry of announcements was Hodgson referring to liquefied natural gas (LNG) as “low-carbon” and emphasizing carbon dioxide removal projects, including Ottawa’s $3.4 million investment in four Canadian ventures through NorthX Climate Tech, Arca Climate Technologies’ 10-year offtake agreement with Microsoft for nearly 300,000 tonnes of carbon removal, and $11 million in federal funding to support carbon utilization and storage research.

The latest Early Estimate of National Emissions (EENE) from 440 Megatonnes shows that in 2024, the oil sands added 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e) to Canada’s total emissions, outpacing all other sectors. Overall emissions remained only 8.5 percent below 2005 levels last year, leaving Canada far from its 2030 goal of reducing emissions by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels.

(440megatonnes.ca Early Estimate of National Emissions)

Hyder Ali says it is frustrating to see Canada framing carbon capture and removal technologies as a climate solution.

“It's been around for 50 years and has barely made a dent in removing emissions. It's preposterous, really, because the same countries that committed to end fossil fuel subsidies are subsidizing technology that doesn't work and only serves to further extend fossil fuel production, and somehow it's supposed to solve the climate crisis,” he noted.

“The evidence speaks for itself. Carbon capture is not a solution; it's a distraction, and it is only being touted as a solution because of the intense lobbying that the fossil industry has done, not only in Canada but across the world, for governments and jurisdictions to continue to advance carbon capture and storage.”

On October 31, more than 50 environmental, health, and Indigenous organizations sent a letter to Carney, Hodgson, and Dabrusin opposing the use of public funds for the Pathways Alliance Carbon Capture and Storage project, arguing the $16.5-billion proposal has a poor record of cutting emissions, serves mainly to prolong oil sands production, and lacks consent from affected Treaty 6 and Treaty 8 Nations.

Pathways Alliance has acknowledged that this costly project would cut only ten to 12 megatonnes of emissions by 2030, roughly five percent of total oil and gas emissions in 2024. Hyder Ali says, “the math doesn’t add up.”

The Pathways Alliance carbon capture and storage project, proposed under Ottawa’s Major Projects list, would run roughly 400 kilometres from over 13 Alberta oilsands facilities in the Fort McMurray, Christina Lake, and Cold Lake regions to a storage site just outside St. Paul, where carbon dioxide would be buried deep underground. Over the years, rural residents along the pipeline’s path have raised concerns about safety, environmental risks, and a lack of meaningful consultation including potential pipeline ruptures, groundwater contamination, threats to Indigenous Treaty Rights, and the discrepancy between ambitious capture goals and historically lower real-world carbon capture rates.

(Canadian Energy Centre)

“Most egregious from a public accounts perspective is that the companies that are petitioning the government for billions of dollars in taxpayer money to build the Pathways project are among the most profitable in Canada,” the letter points out.

“If the companies behind the Pathways Alliance firmly believe that the project will meet stringent GHG reduction targets while providing a strong return on investment - something that is necessary for any business venture - then they should be invited to prove the value of their proposal, and then invest their own capital in the undertaking.”

The coalition is urging the government to reject taxpayer support for the project and instead invest in proven, low-cost climate solutions such as renewable energy, efficient housing, and clean transportation.

How easy is that, when the fossil fuel industry’s claws are sunk so deep into the machinery of our politics?

By June this year, the fossil fuel sector held 355 lobbying meetings with the federal government, including 25 with Prime Minister Mark Carney and Hodgson each.

The top three federal ministries targetted by fossil fuel lobbyists include: Natural Resources Canada (134 meetings), Finance Canada (49), and Environment and Climate Change Canada (37).

Four days after the G7 meeting in Toronto, the Carney government announced its fall economic statement, nixing the oil and gas emissions cap, and announced loosening of Greenwashing rules.

Dabrusin then claimed: “I always try and look for hope when I'm talking about different issues, and I think that this was a real example of how you can see people stepping up and really ready to work together.”

For Hyder Ali, the G7 meeting was “an opportunity” for seven influential countries to come together in the midst of the climate crisis, “to lay out the agenda, to set a path forward, to collectively address the crisis in advance of COP30.”

But “they completely dropped the ball,” he said.

“It was a credibility test, these G7 environmental and energy ministerial meetings, as well as the G7 Leadership Summit, and unfortunately, the countries failed.”

Hyder Ali says he remains “hopeful” ahead of COP30, which kicks off November 10, because “there is a lot of great work happening around the world when it comes to climate action.”

“COP30 will showcase solutions to the climate crisis, and there’s hope that wealthy countries like Canada, whose fossil fuel development has driven much of this crisis, will finally show up. We can’t continue with empty promises…it’s time to back up our words with actions,” he emphasized.

He says it’s optimistic to know that Dabrusin is hopeful and what keeps him going are the “many inspiring examples of communities, activists, and Indigenous governments contributing meaningfully to climate action.”

“Seeing that progress is encouraging,” Hyder Ali said.

“The work we do advocating for stronger climate action is inherently hopeful. We’re striving to create a better world for future generations. We have the knowledge, technology, and capacity to tackle this crisis; it’s just a matter of coming together, collaborating, and prioritizing people over corporate profits.”

The government will spend billions in public funding to reinvigorate U.S. nuclear power, following decades of underinvestment. Unlike renewable energy, Trump views nuclear power as key to expanding the U.S. electricity generation capacity and recently announced the target of quadrupling nuclear capacity by 2050.

In May, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the U.S. to develop 10 new large nuclear reactors by the end of the decade. In addition, several tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, are providing billions in private funding to restart old nuclear plants, upgrade existing ones, and deploy new reactor technology to meet the growing demands from the data centres powering advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence.

The U.S. Department of Energy's (DoE) loan office will dedicate significant funds to the nuclear energy industry to support the development of new reactors. This week, the Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated, ""We have significant lending authority at the loan programme officeâ€¦ By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants - to get those first plants built.""

Wright expects the public support for the sector to encourage private actors to invest more heavily in nuclear power in the coming years. ""When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,"" said Wright.

In October, Trump came to an agreement with the owners of Westinghouse - uranium miner Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management - to invest $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country. Westinghouse plans to construct large nuclear plants to be fitted with its modern AP1000 reactor design, which can power over 750,000 homes, according to the company. Cameco COO Grant Isaac suggested he would look to the DoE's loans office to fund the development of the Westinghouse reactors.

However, critics are not so certain that Westinghouse will be able to deliver on its promises due to the company's poor track record. The firm went bankrupt in 2017 after going over budget on large-scale nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina. Westinghouse will have to prove its ability to build the AP1000 on time and on budget to attract the investment it requires.

The Trump administration has developed various international partnerships to help develop its nuclear power sector in recent months. In September, Japan committed to investing in the Westinghouse nuclear project. The Asian country also agreed on an investment deal for Hitachi GE Vernova to build small modular reactors (SMRs).

Also in September, the U.S. signed a multibillion-dollar deal with the United Kingdom to expand nuclear power across both countries. The new Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy is aimed at accelerating the construction of new reactors and providing reliable, low-carbon energy for high-demand sectors, such as data centres.

The question now is, just how long will it take to achieve the U.S. nuclear renaissance? It typically takes a decade or longer to develop a new nuclear power plant, and while adding additional reactors to existing plants can be faster, licensing and approval can take several years. In addition, after decades of stagnation in the sector, developing nuclear reactors in the U.S. can be extremely costly and slow, due to the lack of expertise, compared to rapidly growing nuclear powers, such as China.

In China, developing a new nuclear reactor now takes between five and six years on average, much faster than the decade-long timeline in most Western countries. This is supported by China's strong regulatory system and tried-and-tested development methods. Meanwhile, in the U.S., just powering up a disused reactor, such as that of Three Mile Island, can take several years to achieve. The projects being funded by tech companies, which focus on the development of SMRs, are not expected to produce power until the next decade, and these are much smaller than conventional reactors.

The Trump administration hopes to speed up the development process through a range of measures. One executive order calls for the nuclear power industry's safety regulator to approve applications in no more than 18 months. The recent funding announcement from the DoE's loan office is expected to help overcome the biggest bottleneck - funding. Congress has also kept its tax breaks in place for nuclear development to attract private funding to the sector.

Thanks to greater political support and public financing, the U.S. nuclear energy sector could rapidly expand its power capacity over the coming decades. However, achieving the level of acceleration in nuclear development expected by the Trump administration is highly unlikely due to a range of challenges hindering development, from expertise to cost and manufacturing capacity. So, while a nuclear renaissance is possible, it is unlikely to be seen within the next decade.

This is the first time since the inaugural Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995 that the U.S. will not be officially represented at the annual climate summit.

However, a large number of state and local representatives — as well as environmental nonprofits based in the U.S. — are in attendance.

A coalition of 100 local U.S. leaders — including governors, mayors and other top city and state officials — made the trip to Belem, Brazil, as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among the notable Americans at COP30, bashed President Donald Trump for disregarding the event, which kicked off Monday.

“While Donald Trump skips the world stage, California is showing up — leading, partnering, and proving what American climate leadership looks like,” Newsom said on Tuesday.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, said in a press conference on Friday that the “Trump administration simply does not represent the American public on climate issues.”

Whitehouse, a ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, accused the current administration of representing the fossil fuel industry, “most particularly the big fossil fuel donors who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s political campaign.”

Why the U.S. did not send any delegates to COP30

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to COP30, according to the White House.

“The U.S. is not sending any high level representatives to COP30,” a White House official told ABC News ahead of the start of the conference. “The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships.”

Last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told The Associated Press that COP30 is “essentially a hoax.”

“It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told the AP, follow a two-day business conference in Athens.

Wright added that he may attend next year’s climate conference “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

The record-breaking U.S. federal government shutdown, which ended late Wednesday, also prevented federal lawmakers from attending the conference.

Who is at COP30?

Most of the nearly 200 countries that participate in the UNFCCC attend COP.

A total of 193 countries, plus the European Union, registered a delegation for the summit. Even North Korea sent a delegation to the climate summit, according to a Carbon Brief analysis.

The only other countries not in attendance are Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino, with each having displayed “sporadic” attendance at past conferences, according to Carbon Brief.

Other notable U.S. politicians who made the event include Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and former Vice President Al Gore.

Several mayors of American cities are also in attendance, including Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson.

American cities have always been at the forefront of innovation and climate action, said Gallego, chair of Climate Mayors and C40 Cities vice chair, in a statement.

“Mayors across the country are doubling down to fill the current void of leadership at the federal level,” Gallego said.

Other notable attendees from the U.S. at COP30 this year include Taryn Finnessey, managing director of the U.S. Climate Alliance.

Why experts say it’s important that the US participates in COP30

It is integral that the U.S., as one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to be present at every COP, environmental advocates told ABC News.

The U.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways, and therefore engagement by Americans signals to investors that the world’s largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes of the energy transition, Maria Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition, told ABC News.

“The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters,” Mendiluce said.

Being on the ground at COP is “essential” so delegations can engage with “full strength,” Max Frankel, director of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Institute, told ABC News.

In addition, the scope and urgency of the climate crisis demands an international response, Max Holmes, president and CEO of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News.

It is important to let other countries know that many Americans are still working to combat climate change, Lynda Hopkins, supervisor of California’s 5th district, County of Sonoma, told ABC News.

Although the White House isn’t in Belem to represent U.S. interest, Americans at COP30 are still working for solutions that are in the best interest of the country, Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told ABC News.

“While the Trump administration retreats, the people and companies here are seizing the opportunity to innovate, create jobs, and build safer, healthier futures,” Krupp said.

Although Hopkins said she and other American subnational delegates were “warmly received” by other countries, some prominent figures at COP30 indicated that the U.S. was not needed at the conference to accomplish goals.

Christiana Figueres, a diplomat from Costa Rica who played a key role in the inception of the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the U.S. would not be able to “do their direct bullying” due to the Trump administration’s boycott of the summit.

“I actually think it is a good thing,” Figueres said during a press conference on Tuesday.

Figueres then said, “Ciao, bambino,” which translates to “Bye, little boy,” in Italian, in response to Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time.

Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, described the Trump administration’s absence as “shortsighted decision” and a “slap in the face” to Americans who want clean air and water and lower energy costs.

“The reality is that this work will continue with or without America,” Frankel said.

His essay, “Three Tough Truths About Climate,” sent a shockwave through the climate movement on the eve of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil. But the essay is less blueprint than Rorschach test, because anyone can selectively quote from its 5,000 words to support a wide variety of viewpoints.

Like many such documents, this one begins with a strawman. In a move more typical of the Breakthrough Institute, a California-based group founded on the premise that environmentalism harms the climate cause, Gates rejects the “doomsday” argument that “nothing matters more than limiting the rise in temperature.” Little does – but Gates chose to go with “nothing,” a much stronger word.

He then argues that climate change, though a “serious” problem, “will not be the end of civilisation.” But supercharged storms and other climate-driven disasters are already upending lives and livelihoods. Of the five recorded storms severe enough to warrant the proposed “category 6” classification, all have happened in the past 15 years.

“

Climate change kills. Economists can now calculate the mortality cost of carbon. Each ton of CO2 emitted today kills around 0.0002 people. Again, such costs can add up quickly. The lifetime emissions generated by every 3.5 Americans today will kill one person by the end of the century.

Moreover, we are not dealing only with massive, headline-grabbing extremes and global tipping points (irreversible planetary changes). There are also the pernicious, often hidden “slow burn” effects, like the 0.04 per cent loss in annual payroll for one additional day above 32°C (90°F) in any given year. Such costs add up quickly. To point out that we can still live with average global warming below 3°C is hardly reassuring, especially for the poor and vulnerable who already suffer the most.

Gates’s reasoning on this socioeconomic dimension is understandable. His second and third tough truths focus on human suffering and prosperity, and these are indeed the criteria against which climate progress should be measured.

Annual greenhouse-gas emissions, their atmospheric concentrations, the resulting warming, and effects like rising seas and more devastating storms are all ultimately proxies for lives that will be disrupted or even ended prematurely.

Climate change kills. Economists can now calculate the mortality cost of carbon. Each ton of CO2 emitted today kills around 0.0002 people. Again, such costs can add up quickly. The lifetime emissions generated by every 3.5 Americans today will kill one person by the end of the century.

True, many people already die from other preventable causes. Gates himself has called out US President Donald Trump’s administration for cutting aid funding in ways that will kill children in some of the poorest parts of the world. In an effort to make up for some of the shortfall with his own foundation and personal wealth, Gates has reduced his giving for climate programs and investments, both in the US and globally.

No one doubts that there are only so many philanthropic dollars to go around. But climate finance goes well beyond charity, as Gates shows by his own actions.

His own total public health and climate funding have increased over time. “Funding,” in this case, includes support for Breakthrough Energy (which has no relation to the Institute), which has invested in more than 150 companies that need help scaling up climate technologies by driving down the “green premium” (the added costs of low-carbon technologies relative to high-carbon ones that pay nothing for their negative externalities).

Reducing this premium is necessary for many early-stage startups that have yet to climb the learning curve and benefit from economies of scale. Fortunately, there are plenty of other climate technologies that are already in the money. Solar power’s rapid growth over the past half-decade is the result of economics, not benevolence. The same goes for battery prices, which have fallen by about 50 per cent since 2010.

While other low-carbon technologies still command a green premium, most are trending toward profitability. Still, we need creative thinking to help them get there. Co-production helps. A company focused on a single product might lose against incumbents, but spreading the green premium across two or more products can cut costs significantly.

The Gates-funded company Brimstone, for example, focuses both on producing lower-carbon cement and on making money from the alumina extracted in the production process. Sublime, a rival cement startup, is pursuing a similar strategy. (I recently co-authored a study with Brimstone’s CEO, Cody Finke, and a half-dozen colleagues, including an employee of another Gates-funded venture, on precisely this point.)

Patience helps, too. Back when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was the governor of the Bank of England, he poignantly described the climate as a “tragedy of the horizon.” Too many businesses feel compelled to focus on short-term earnings, just as political leaders are unable to think beyond election cycles. But some of Gates’s climate investments, like those in the next-generation nuclear company TerraPower, and especially his investments in Commonwealth Fusion, are deliberately structured to yield returns years or even decades from now.

Supportive policies help, such as the explicit carbon prices and decarbonisation targets in the European Union, or the subsidies that are more prominent in the United States. The key, in each case, is to provide long-term investment certainty.

This is an area where Gates’s essay is especially weak. While Gates fully recognises the importance of policy, he has created an opening for those, like Trump, who put their personal, short-term gain first.

But make no mistake: the benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels far outweigh the costs. Gates clearly understands that. Clean energy is about sovereignty, energy security, equity, and, yes, future competitiveness.

Ending reliance on oil, coal, and gas, and embracing technologies that will only become better and cheaper over time, is not just smart climate policy. It is the best way to improve economic competitiveness and human prosperity for decades to come.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/54917963503_83e0b26278_6k.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:23.753055

That's why experts say to work in groups,Caleigh Wells,,,,,https://www.the-independent.com/news/united-states-cop30-donald-trump-brazil-congress-b2865910.html,"Hundreds of global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil.
Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents.
City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Hundreds of global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,"" said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you're trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn't make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

""And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people's behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. ""Most people don’t even realize they’re there.""

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they're protesting or backing. If you like what they're doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn't much you can do about it. ""I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,"" he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

This will be a win-win trade deal between the world’s largest country with 1.45 billion people (India) and the superpower (USA). China is a competitor to the United States in advanced technologies, higher education, and defense investments.

This situation will always push the United States government to have a cautious approach in dealings with China.

With the current tariff levels, exports from China have fallen by 25% since last year, which provides opportunities for other big textile manufacturers and exporters.

Leading economies like the United States and EU will always look for strategic partnerships with countries like India to balance China.

For over two decades now, United States’ administrations have viewed India as a counterbalance to China in the Pacific and South Asian regions.

It is clear from the recent statements by the United States’ President about India being the world’s largest country in terms of its population, the U.S. would want to engage with India for its global political strategy and exporting advanced products and defense technologies to India.

While the current tariffs for imports from India are still at 50%, as I have opined, the 25% additional tariff for Russian oil imports by India is being used as a negotiating tool by the United States to restrict funds flowing to Russia. On Nov. 10, President Donald Trump announced that the tariff on India will be reduced, and a win-win deal will be forthcoming.

I believe the tariff rate for India will be about 15-20%. My estimate is based on the existing global base rate of 10% and other pollical scenarios.

Given that President Trump is a firm believer in tariffs as a way of balancing the trade with nations and revamping domestic manufacturing, a zero-tariff regime is highly unlikely. If the deal of 15-20% comes through, India’s tariff rate will be half that of China. China’s rate which includes the Section 301 tariff will be 45 percent. India will come out competitive against China and on par with Bangladesh and other textile exporting nations.

How a favorable U.S.-India trade deal can benefit West Texas

A favorable trade deal with India will be beneficial to the High Plains’ cotton sector in a medium to long run. India has waived its import duties on cotton till the end of this year.

Recent reports have shown that cotton imports to India have risen. India may need a good supply of cotton at competitive rates if it can replace some amount from the Chinese export market. Cotton from West Texas has been having a positive reputation in India in terms of less trash, fewer breaks while spinning and overall quality based on my interaction with a general manager of a South India-based textile mill which has over 70,000 ring spindles which spins fine count yarns.

With the trade deal optimistically expected by the end of the year, it is important to enhance engagement between the United States and India, not only at the government levels, but also trade bodies and professional associations in the textiles sector have important roles to play to prepare for rebooting and boosting trade.

In line with this strategy, two leading professional associations in the field of textiles are engaging on a global platform in India.

India-based world’s largest textile professional association Textile Association (India) through its South India Unit [TAI-SIU] will host the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) this Nov. 21-22, in its annual conference to be held in the textile hub, Coimbatore. With over 600 industry personnel expected to participate, the event will boost confidence and provide opportunity to meet with the representative of a major association from the United States which has leading brands such as Nike, and Under Armour as corporate members.

Gregg Woodcock, executive director of AATCC, will be visiting India for the first time ever, trying to build a solid bridge between the textile sectors of the two nations. He will be talking about the importance of color fastness and physical properties in textile evaluation, which are vital parameters in export trade. Engagement with AATCC is important for boosting bilateral as AATCC is a leading association focusing on quality aspects and standards.

For the Indian textiles industry to be competitive, in addition to the cost factor, improving its product offerings and quality are valuable.

The collaboration between two major nations in trade and the cooperation between the world’s leading associations in the field of textiles will go a long way in boosting trade and relationships between two nations.

This Summer as the Ambassador of AATCC for India, I worked to initiate collaboration in the form of establishing student chapters for AATCC in India. By the time Woodcock arrives in India, four student chapters of AATCC will be in the making in India in institutions located in Bengaluru, Coimbatore, and Chennai.

The Textile Association (India), TAI-SIU event is timely and will be a reboot the textiles trade and technical relations between India and the United States.

Now that the United States’ longest government shutdown has ended, efforts will go into high gear related to trade and foreign policy engagements and hence diplomatic and professional interactions between both countries will be strategically helpful.

During the past week’s deliberations, Brazil has placed people, knowledge, and culture at the centre of COP30.
For Brazil, the new roads, transit corridors, and bigger airport are not just cosmetic changes; they have succeeded in placing the Amazon at the centre of global climate discourse.","When President Lula da Silva announced in 2023 that Brazil would host COP30 in Belem — the capital of Para, better known for its rivers, forests and Amazonian air than for roads, hotels or meeting halls — many Brazilians were surprised. Most people doubted whether the city could host one of the largest gatherings in the world. Yet for the past 10 days, world leaders, scientists, activists, diplomats, and fossil fuel lobbyists have been flying into this city as delegates from about 200 countries to debate the climate crisis. For the first time, the UN Climate Conference is taking place on the doorstep of a region — the Amazon — that embodies both the scale of the problem and the solutions needed to save the planet.

The first week of COP30 ended with major deadlocks unresolved, as talks happened in the shadow of COP29 in Azerbaijan, where rich countries had pledged to provide $300 billion annually to developing countries by 2035. Now, the rich world is dragging its feet, while the Global South is stepping in. Andre Correa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat presiding over COP30, summarised the mood on the eve of the meeting’s opening: “Somehow the reduction in enthusiasm of the Global North is showing that the Global South is moving. It is not just this year, it has been moving for years, but it did not have the exposure that it has now,” Mr. Correa do Lago said last Monday.

Fractured front

However, COP30 is buzzing with debates and activities even as the rich world takes a back seat on emissions reduction and financing the climate action plan to the tune of $1.3 trillion by 2035. This year, the U.S. — historically the world’s biggest emitter — quit the Paris Agreement; and the White House has not sent a delegation to Belem. Europe is present but divided, with its 2040 targets stalled by political infighting and a rising far-right, forcing the EU governments to retreat from their commitments.

But the Global South — led by Brazil — is not playing the victim. It has responded with ambition. During the past week’s deliberations, Brazil has placed people, knowledge, and culture at the centre of COP30. In a dialogue with civil society, Mr. Correa do Lago stressed that climate action “is built through cooperation among peoples” to ensure that the energy transition creates jobs and reduces inequalities. The host country has launched several initiatives: the “Belem Health Action Plan” puts climate-resilient health systems at the core of adaptation, while a “Green Education” proposal highlights how teachers and students can prepare their societies for a world which is getting hotter. Brazil has also launched a “Commitment Letter”, backed by 130 organisations, to combat climate misinformation globally.

COP30 is shaping up to be the most ambitious climate conference yet, with far bigger goals. The best example is the “Belem Declaration for Green Industrialisation”, which calls on nations to accelerate energy transition while creating new green-economy opportunities, especially for developing countries. Its core message is clear: without strong and inclusive economic growth, true decarbonisation will not occur. Brazil’s Vice President Geraldo Alckmin summed it up on Friday: “Climate goals must go hand in hand with real economic transformation… ensuring that all countries, especially those in the Global South, can lead and benefit from this new era of sustainable prosperity.”

At the inauguration of COP30, President Lula had declared that Belem “will not be the same city” once the meeting ends. For Brazil, the new roads, transit corridors, and bigger airport are not just cosmetic changes; they have succeeded in placing the Amazon at the centre of global climate discourse. With negotiations running until November 21, Brazil is now pushing for COP30 to give a clear blue-print for a better climate action plan.

Belem, a city once doubted for its capacity to host a global meeting, may end up adopting the declaration named after it — and deliver a solution the world needs desperately.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/n6ygtk/article70285102.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-11-14T154446Z_1005411045_RC2FWHA7HYQS_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATE-COP30-GERMANY-PROTEST.JPG,N,,2025-11-15 18:00:14.161049

In April, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said the company is actively seeking suppliers outside China to ease tariff pressures.","On Friday, Nov. 14, The Wall Street Journal reported that electric-vehicle maker Tesla has begun requiring its suppliers to remove China-made components when producing vehicles for Tesla’s U.S. factories.

Sources told the Journal that under CEO Elon Musk’s direction, Tesla and its suppliers have already replaced some China-made parts and plan to shift all remaining related components to production outside China within the next one to two years.

The report noted that years of ongoing U.S.–China trade disputes—and the constant tariff adjustments that come with them—have complicated how automakers set pricing strategies.

A Reuters report in April said Tesla had significantly increased its reliance on North American suppliers for its U.S. factories over the past two years to counter the risk of rising tariffs.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s performance in the Chinese market has been uneven. Earlier this month, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed that Tesla’s China-made EV sales reached 61,497 units in October, down 9.9 percent year-on-year, reversing the 2.8 percent year-on-year growth seen in September.

Production of the Shanghai-built Model 3 and Model Y (including exports) also fell 32.3 percent from September.

Reuters reported that growing U.S.–China tensions throughout 2025 have kept auto-industry executives in “crisis mode.” Under President Trump’s tariff policies, along with repeated panic over rare-earth bottlenecks and chip shortages, more automakers are re-evaluating their dependence on China as a key source of components and raw materials.

GM orders suppliers to remove China-made parts

This week, General Motors (GM) was also reported to have instructed thousands of suppliers to remove China-made parts from its supply chain.

According to a Nov. 12 Reuters report, GM issued the directive to strengthen the company’s “resilience” amid geopolitical tensions. Some suppliers were told to fully end procurement from China as early as 2027.

GM began conveying this requirement to certain suppliers in late 2024, but the rapid escalation of the 2025 U.S.–China trade war has made the process more urgent. GM executives said this move is part of a broader strategy to improve supply-chain stability and control.

Industry sources said that geopolitical tensions, fluctuating tariffs, and supply-chain risks involving rare earths and chips have kept auto executives in “emergency response mode” throughout 2025. The Trump administration’s push for reshoring investment has also driven companies to reassess their long-term dependence on China.

Reuters noted that GM has already been restructuring its EV battery-material and chip supply chains, partnering with U.S. rare-earth companies and investing in Nevada lithium mines. But the new directive is broader in scope, targeting more fundamental and high-volume components and raw materials.

GM CEO Mary Barra said in a quarterly earnings call that the company has spent recent years building supply-chain resilience and aims to source as many parts as possible in the same country where vehicles are assembled. GM’s global purchasing chief Shilpan Amin stressed that supply-disruption risks mean automakers can no longer rely solely on the lowest-cost country.

The report added that China dominates fields such as automotive lighting, electronics, molds, and stamped parts, making supply-chain relocation slow and costly. Colin Shaw, head of the U.S. Vehicle Suppliers Association, said many supplier relationships took 20–30 years to build, and dismantling them in just a few years is “nearly impossible.”

Although China and the U.S. agreed to roll back some tariffs and export restrictions after the late-October Biden–Xi meeting, concerns continue to rise over rare-earth export controls and chip-supply disruptions. For example, China’s recent suspension of shipments to Nexperia triggered industry warnings of potential large-scale factory shutdowns.

Tesla and Samsung in talks as Tesla advances ‘de-China-ization’ of its supply chain

At the same time, Tesla is aggressively restructuring its supply chain for its energy and storage business. According to a Reuters report on Nov. 4, South Korea’s Samsung SDI confirmed it is in talks with Tesla to supply energy-storage batteries—considered another key step in reducing Tesla’s reliance on China-made critical components. Samsung SDI said the deal is not yet finalized.

The Korea Economic Daily reported that the potential three-year contract could exceed 3 trillion won (about US$2.11 billion). China’s “Autohome” later reported, citing Samsung SDI regulatory filings, that the discussed volume is 30 GWh of storage batteries over three years—about 10 GWh per year—valued at 1–1.5 trillion won annually.

If finalized, the deal would mark a major shift in Tesla’s energy-storage business. According to Chinese media, Tesla currently relies heavily on Chinese suppliers (especially CATL) for storage batteries, and U.S. tariffs have had an “excessive impact” on Tesla’s energy division.

In April, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said the company is actively seeking suppliers outside China to ease tariff pressures.

Tesla has also signed chip and battery-supply agreements with Samsung Electronics and LG Energy Solution. In July, LG Energy Solution announced a three-year, 5.9-trillion-won LFP battery order widely believed to be from Tesla.

Analysts say that if Samsung SDI successfully enters Tesla’s North American storage-battery supply chain, Samsung and LG would form a “dual-insurance” setup. This would help Tesla meet Inflation Reduction Act tax-credit requirements, reduce costs, and strengthen competitiveness.

Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents.
City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Hundreds of global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,” said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you’re trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn’t make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

“And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people’s behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. “Most people don’t even realize they’re there.”

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they’re protesting or backing. If you like what they’re doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn’t much you can do about it. “I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,” he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

Texas Pacific Land Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Texas Pacific Land shareholder, you need to believe in the sustainability of its robust royalty income and expanding water services, both driven by continued high operator activity in the Permian Basin. The latest quarterly results, including record production and strong earnings, further supported these core strengths, while the recent shareholder vote outcome on governance does not materially alter the biggest near-term catalyst, ongoing production growth, or the most prominent risk, which is concentrated exposure to Permian development trends.

The reaffirmed quarterly cash dividend of US$1.60 per share speaks directly to Texas Pacific Land’s consistent approach to shareholder returns, reinforcing expectations for resilient cash generation as growth in oil, gas, and NGL production sustains substantial free cash flow.

But while top-line numbers and distributions impress, investors should not overlook the concentrated geographic risk that comes with heavy reliance on the Permian Basin…

Texas Pacific Land is projected to reach $895.3 million in revenue and $610.3 million in earnings by 2028. This forecast assumes a 7.2% annual increase in revenue and a $150.1 million increase in earnings from the current level of $460.2 million.

Energy companies have realised the potential of flooding abandoned coal mines to provide vast quantities of geothermal power, as water in coal mines can reach a temperature of up to 20 degrees Celsius.
Mine water geothermal heat (MWGH) systems use the water from flooded coal mines, which is heated through a natural process, to supply clean heat to houses and businesses in the surrounding area.

The authority also launched the Gateshead Mine Water Heat Living Laboratory this year to study thermal and hydrogeological behaviour across operational MWGH projects.","Coal mines are finding a second life as companies invest in repurposing huge, disused coal sites into geothermal power projects. In the U.K., the government and energy companies have been discussing the idea for several years, and it seems to be gaining momentum with the launch of the first geothermal mine projects this year.

Energy companies have realised the potential of flooding abandoned coal mines to provide vast quantities of geothermal power, as water in coal mines can reach a temperature of up to 20 degrees Celsius. Mine water geothermal heat (MWGH) systems use the water from flooded coal mines, which is heated through a natural process, to supply clean heat to houses and businesses in the surrounding area. This works by using heat exchangers and pumps to recover the heat and distribute it to buildings via district heating networks.

Heating currently contributes around 40 percent of energy use in the U.K. The country’s building heating is a major contributor to emissions, accounting for between 17 and 18 percent of total greenhouse gases, primarily from burning natural gas. Therefore, developing cleaner heat production methods is key to decarbonising the U.K. in line with government climate targets.

A recent report suggests that around a quarter of U.K. homes sit on top of sites where MWGH could be used to provide low-cost, low-carbon heat. “With the right support in place, MWGH could be built out at scale within five years. It’s not technologically complex, relatively speaking, but it takes some governance and social organisation,” Simone Abram, the co-author of the report, explained. Abram used Denmark as an example of where the technology has already been successfully rolled out.

In addition to providing clean energy, the redevelopment of coal mines could bring energy jobs back to former mining areas, with the need for specialists in drilling, engineering, and operations. This could help reinvigorate struggling economies across the country. The authors of the report also highlight the importance of community consultation to gain support for development. Community engagement will help demonstrate how MWGH projects can bring economic growth back to disadvantaged towns and cities, as well as provide clean heating and new job opportunities.

Despite the ongoing discussion between energy companies and the U.K. government about the potential for MWGH, the U.K. has been slow to develop its first geothermal projects of this type. This is largely due to the high set-up cost and the complex regulatory environment. To support development, the U.K. government must update its energy regulations to allow companies to develop this type of geothermal project. The provision of grants and low-interest loans by the state could also help to encourage higher levels of private investment in the sector.

Earlier in the year, the Mining Remediation Authority (MRA), formerly known as the Coal Authority, launched the U.K.’s first MWGH project near Ammanford in Wales. The project uses floodwater from an abandoned mine as a renewable source of heating for a warehouse. Roughly 25 litres of water per second is pumped from the Lindsay pit each day, before being treated and filtered through natural waterways.

The MRA hopes to develop several other MWGH projects in south and north-east Wales to develop it into a geothermal energy hub. However, some projects have been hard to get off the ground due to the lack of familiarity with the energy source. For example, a similar heat scheme was halted by Bridgend council in 2021 over concerns of rising costs. However, the Welsh government has acknowledged the “significant role mine water heat can play in our journey to net zero.”

The MRA also commenced construction works in March on the Dawdon mine in County Durham, in the north of England. The MWGH project is expected to provide heating for a new housing development, a new primary school, a village centre, and innovation hubs once complete. Vital Energi has been appointed to design, build, and operate the system, which is expected to provide clean heat for the next 40 years.

The authority also launched the Gateshead Mine Water Heat Living Laboratory this year to study thermal and hydrogeological behaviour across operational MWGH projects. It is thought to be the first project of its kind globally.

Fiona Todd from the MRA explained, “Our Living Laboratory will provide invaluable insights into the behaviour of mine water heat systems and help us understand how multiple schemes co-exist within the same region… This research is crucial for maximising the opportunity presented by mine water heat and supporting its development as a reliable, low-carbon heat source across the U.K.”

The U.K. sees significant potential in the repurposing of coal mines to develop geothermal energy projects, to provide clean heating for up to 25 percent of the country’s population. However, to accelerate the growth of the sector, the government must revise its energy regulations to simplify the framework for developing such projects. The introduction of financial incentives from the state could also help to attract more private investment to the sector.

The $206.9 million project is expected to create 1,200 jobs in Mecklenburg County.

The company’s new 300,000-square-foot corporate headquarters, located at Plaza Midwood Commonwealth, will serve as the home base for research and development, IT, finance, sales, marketing, and other corporate functions.

“Charlotte is the ideal home for Scout Motors – a place as dynamic as our people and brand, where heritage and pride meet progress and innovation,” said Scott Keogh, President and CEO of Scout Motors. “With a thriving talent pool, world-class universities, and a deserved reputation as a launchpad for bold ideas, Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably. We’ll build a headquarters that reflects our culture, empowers our teams, and connects us to a region that’s fast becoming a national hub for mobility and manufacturing.”

The project will be supported, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $4.8 billion. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs and capital investment, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $46,524,750, spread over 12 years. State payments occur only following performance verification by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets.

The project’s projected return on investment of public dollars is 67 percent, meaning for every dollar of potential cost to the state, the state receives $1.67 in state revenue. JDIG projects result in positive net tax revenue to the state treasury, even after taking into consideration the grant’s reimbursement payments to a given company.

“Scout Motors carries forward a proud American legacy of innovation and craftsmanship to North Carolina,” noted N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “We’re honored that this storied brand is building its next chapter here—joining dozens of world-class companies that have chosen to invest in our state. With our talented workforce, strong business climate, and exceptional quality of life, Scout Motors reinforces why North Carolina remains America’s Top State for Business.”

Because Scout Motors chose a site in Mecklenburg County, which is classified by the state’s economic tier system as Tier 3, the company’s JDIG agreement also calls for moving as much as $15.5 million into the state’s Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account. The Utility Account helps rural communities anywhere in the state finance necessary infrastructure upgrades to attract future business.

What's happening?

The report determined that plant retirements, coupled with a failure to add capacity, could lead to a ""surge in power outages,"" particularly as growing demand from artificial intelligence data centers strains grids.

Data centers require immense amounts of electricity. Although some use clean energy sources like wind and solar, they will consume twice as much energy by 2030, per Scientific American.

If the U.S. can't keep up with demand, ""most regions will face unacceptable reliability risks within five years,"" the report found.

The department projected a 104-gigawatt loss due to plant retirements by 2030, which could lead to more than 800 hours of outages annually. It further recommended adding capacity via coal and gas.

""President Trump's administration is committed to advancing a strategy of energy addition, and supporting all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure,"" said energy secretary Chris Wright. ""If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.""

Why is this concerning?

Large-scale blackouts pose a serious threat to the economy, national security, and daily life, and vulnerable communities — including low-income households and those with underlying health conditions — bear the most risk.

Moreover, the DOE's claims that clean energy sources are exacerbating blackouts have been debunked by Princeton University's ZERO Lab, as Canary Media explained.

The current energy crisis is driven by several factors, including a massive boom in data center deployment, increased extreme weather, and skyrocketing demand for electricity for AI applications.

But as the energy experts explained, clean energy sources are not fueling the risk of blackouts.

According to ZERO lab, the DOE overestimated plant retirements and underestimated new generation capacity anticipated in the same period. Researchers believed the DOE intentionally omitted data to prioritize dirty fuels and undermine the clean energy boom.

With battery energy storage systems rapidly coming online — Utility Dive reported that capacity is expected to more than double by 2027 — experts expect significant grid stability even as power plants are phased out.

How can you prepare for potential outages?

Going solar is one of the most effective ways to slash utility bills and your home's environmental impact.

EnergySage provides instant solar quotes and connects you with vetted contractors at no cost, ensuring your lights stay on — even during increasing blackouts, when paired with a battery backup.

Its free mapping tool even shows customers average local home solar costs, available incentives, and rebates on a state-by-state basis. On average, EnergySage users save up to $10,000 on new installations.

For those on a budget, Palmetto's LightReach leasing program has $0 down options, allowing customers to lock in low energy rates and reliable service without a large upfront investment.

Pairing solar with an energy-efficient heat pump boosts energy savings by $400 a year on average, according to Rewiring America — and Mitsubishi makes it easy for homeowners to find the right heat pump and installer for their needs and budget.

Those who plan to claim a 30% solar or heat pump tax credit should act before they expire at the end of 2025, per Canary Media.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jn9qIx3DO7rGOWJ73nWN.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/0e34b804d1aa8c9af9e08c799b671b63,N,,2025-11-16 00:58:12.654248

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

It’s not a novel observation to say that supporters of President Donald Trump and supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders find common ground on many issues. They often share a skepticism of entrenched power and a desire to dismantle systems that they think have ceased to serve everyday people.

In Indiana, this agreement includes a distrust of data centers.

“The MAGA crowd and the Bernie bros have both figured out that they’ve been getting duped,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy nonprofit. “It was data centers that really brought it all together.”

Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.

He has received an emphatic response, with groups from the left, right and in-between booking him for speaking engagements and offering their assistance.

Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.

Much of the discussion is about data centers, which are often large developments used to support cloud computing or artificial intelligence. But the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.

“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”

I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.

Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.

Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.

It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.

Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.

Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.

He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”

He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.

Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.

“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.

The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.

Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.

“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.

Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.

But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.

From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.

Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.

Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is “disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.

In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocate jointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

IEA Report Points to Oil Peak and Continuing Renewables Surge, But Trump Has Hurt Progress: The world remains on track to reach peak oil in about 2030 if countries stick to their stated policies, according to the new edition of the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency. But this outlook is worse for the climate than the one issued last year, due in large part to changes in climate policy by President Donald Trump, as my colleague Blanca Begert reports. One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.

How the Trump Administration Is Seeking to Gut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The Trump administration is proposing a $0 budget for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, underscoring how far the office has fallen since it was a key part of planning for the country’s energy future, as Maria Gallucci reports for Canary Media. The office, which is part of the Department of Energy, was created by Congress in 2021 and received $27 billion to fund projects to scale up clean energy technologies. The sudden shift in funding priorities is ceding leadership to other countries, especially China, and is baffling to people who were connected to the office.

Sunrun Reports a Quadrupling of Participation in Virtual Power Plants: Sunrun, the rooftop solar and battery company, said 106,000 of its customers are now participating in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs, which is an increase of more than 400 percent from a year ago, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. Sunrun also said its business model, which encourages solar leasing and monthly subscription fees, positions the company to maintain growth even after an expected sales cliff in the rooftop solar industry when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year.

While it would be ideal for this funding to go toward the development of solar-powered phones, the company's investment in energy offsetting is quite impactful.

Apple has signed contracts with multiple solar farms across Europe, totaling 650 megawatts of renewable power, according to TechCrunch. This power offsets more energy use of 1.5 billion iPhone users worldwide, as well as Mac Pros and Apple Watches, which together account for almost one-third of Apple's carbon footprint.

The solar farms will be spread out across Europe in Greece, Latvia, Spain, Poland, Romania, and Italy. Currently, more than 90% of Apple's manufacturing in China is powered by renewable energy, and it will also invest $150 million to raise that percentage further.

A notable fact about this news is that Apple has announced it on all of its international websites but not on its U.S. press site, potentially to avoid drawing attention or backlash from the Trump Administration, which has ended multiple clean energy projects and removed incentives.

Apple earned almost $400 billion in revenue from iPhones alone in 2024, according to Business of Apps. As one of the most profitable businesses in the world and one with a high carbon footprint, its energy offset is an incredible step toward reducing that.

Apple's goal is to power 100% of its products with clean energy by 2030. This sets a stellar example for other companies around the world to do the same. Its investment also helps lower the overall cost of solar and wind power, as their prevalence increases, making it more affordable for everyone.

Fossil fuels, also known as dirty energy, are non-renewable and expected to deplete over the next 30 to 60 years, according to Investopedia. Exposure to these fuels in our air can also cause respiratory issues, such as asthma and lung cancer, and stroke.

Welcome back to the Pfluger Fly-By, a roundup of events and updates to keep you informed about everything I’m doing week by week to represent you in Congress.

This week, I was back in Washington to reopen the government after six weeks of Democrats’ obstruction and harmful political theatrics to keep it closed. Throughout the entire shutdown, my team and I worked diligently to ensure constituents in every corner of Texas-11 had the resources needed to navigate the chaos and care for their families. Now, I am ready and eager to get back to governing in Washington to continue delivering on the mandate we were given by the American people last November.

Below, you’ll find photos and highlights from the week, plus information on how my office can assist you with any federal concerns. As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Best,

The Longest Government Shutdown in History is Over

While I am thankful the government is finally reopened, I am painfully aware of the impact it has had on communities in Texas-11 and across America. It is important to remember that both the shutdown and the pain it inflicted were entirely preventable.

Weeks ago, I did the responsible thing and voted to keep the government open with a clean, nonpartisan continuing resolution (CR). This was the same CR that Democrats supported 13 times under President Biden. Yet this time under President Trump, nearly every single House and Senate Democrat changed their vote, shutting the government down and hurting American families in the process.

For more than six weeks, Democrats proceeded to hold our country hostage over demands for taxpayer-funded health care for illegal aliens and trillions in wasteful spending. The irony is that, despite all their threats and lies, we are still in the same place with the same deal we had on day one of the shutdown. Democrats gained nothing because Republicans stayed united and refused to cave to the Democrats’ radical demands to waste your hard-earned taxpayer dollars.

This week, on November 12, 2025, we passed the same clean CR to open the government that we passed weeks ago, funding critical programs like WIC, SNAP, and Child Nutrition, paying federal workers, service members, and air traffic controllers, and supporting veterans’ health care and benefits. Yet once again, the majority of House and Senate Democrats voted against it. Thankfully, the political pressure from their own party did not prevent a few reasonable Democrats from coming to the table this week and voting to reopen the government.

Now that President Trump has signed the CR and the government is open, federal workers will begin receiving back pay, specialized training at Goodfellow Air Force Base and Fort Hood will resume, small business loans will resume being approved, and airports will return to full staffing ahead of the busy holiday travel season.

As I mentioned earlier, I am ready and eager to get back to governing in Washington to continue delivering on the mandate we were given by the American people last November. If you have questions about the government reopening, especially if you were impacted by the shutdown, please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office.

Reimbursing Texas for Biden’s Border Crisis

Today, I was proud to lead the entire Republican Texas congressional delegation alongside U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) in a letter to the U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS), urging them to prioritize the State of Texas when disbursing the $13.5 billion in border security reimbursements I helped secure earlier this year.

The devastating impact of the previous administration’s open border policies has been felt nationwide—but no state has carried the burden more than Texas. Texas spent $11.1 billion on border security, including $5.87 billion on personnel costs and $4.75 billion on border wall and barriers. When the federal government failed to secure our border and protect our communities, Texans stepped up. We will not rest until Texas is paid for what it’s owed.

EPA Grants Texas Primacy Over Class VI Wells

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it was granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells. Under the previous administration, the permitting process for Class VI wells was painfully slow. I am grateful that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recognized this and placed his confidence in state experts who know their geology and how to support it in the best way possible.

Far too often, bureaucratic red tape gets in the way of those who know the energy industry best, stifling production and disincentivizing innovation. I introduced legislation alongside my colleague Congressman Dan Crenshaw (TX-02) to expedite state approval of these wells. Texas leads the way in efficient energy production nationwide, and we intend to keep it that way.

Southern Border Apprehensions Hit Lowest in Half a Century

This week, the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security released its latest “Border Brief” factsheet, detailing that apprehensions by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol hit record lows in half a century for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. After four years of the Biden-Harris Administration’s disastrous open-border agenda and reckless catch-and-release policies, I am thankful the American people are finally seeing a return to law and order at our southern border.

Thanks to the strong leadership of the Trump Administration, our borders and our homeland are more secure today than they have been in years. House Republicans have also delivered real solutions at the border by passing legislation that invests in cutting-edge technology, modernizes critical equipment, and expands the Border Patrol workforce to protect the homeland from nefarious actors. I look forward to continuing this mission on the House Homeland Security Committee and building on this historic success to keep our borders and communities safe for years to come.

State of Texas Files for Rural Health Transformation Fund

I am thrilled to support the State of Texas’s application to receive funding from the newly announced $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, made possible through the historic Working Families Tax Cuts Act that I proudly voted for earlier this year.

The funding in this program will provide significant support to rural hospitals and health care providers in Texas by equipping them with the necessary equipment and resources to deliver vital care to patients in need. This is critical, as many of my constituents often have to drive long distances to see health care providers in larger cities rather than where they live. While this is merely an inconvenience for routine check-ups, it is a serious issue when unexpected medical emergencies occur, and time is of the essence.

The response was varied, with some putting their full support behind a project that they see as a fix to an unreliable energy grid and a job generator. Others are pushing back, concerned the operations will drain groundwater reserves and disrupt their bucolic lifestyle.

The Independent Energy System Operator, or IESO, has said it needs the fast-acting power generators to replace coal-fired power plants, which have to be retired by 2030. Plus, it said it needs a backup power source to prevent outages as more wind and solar power comes online.

Put another way, wind and solar plants produce energy intermittently, and the grid needs fast-acting backup power to fill in the gaps.

“I think it's a great thing,” local resident John McLeod said in an interview at one of the IESO’s public information sessions this week.

The IESO hosted sessions in Salt Springs and Marshdale, where the plants might be built. The sites were identified because of their proximity to an existing natural gas pipeline and power lines.

McLeod said he sees the project as necessary for improving the power grid, and an economic boon for Pictou County.

“That's a plus here because you don't [have] many jobs being created here in this area,” he said.

The IESO says each plant could create between 100 and 125 jobs during construction and between 10 and 15 jobs during operations.

But Holly Irons, another local resident, said she’s disappointed and worried.

“I don’t want it,” said Irons, who lives about a kilometre from the proposed site in Salt Springs, in an interview at the same session.

Water usage

Her primary concern is that the project will impact her well. The IESO says a 300-megawatt fast-acting generator requires a volume of water that’s equivalent to what’s used by 750 average rural households.

IESO project manager Aaron Long told CBC News they’ll drill deeper than most residential wells, tapping into separate aquifers. He said the plant operator would help find a remedy if wells are impacted.

That’s little comfort to Irons, who said she cherishes her well for its quality and reliability, even through this summer’s drought.

“I don't want the municipal water coming in to give me water while they take our beautiful well water that I love so dearly.”

The plan

The IESO is doing some preliminary work on the projects, including field work to make an application for environmental assessment by the province. It has also signed options to purchase and lease the required land. It will later hand over the reins to a private developer.

The IESO plans to open bids in the new year for a contract to build and operate the plant, or plants. Long said the winning bidder will pay the full cost of construction, which he estimates to be about $800 million for one 300-megawatt plant.

Long said he knows a project of this scale is “a big change,” for a rural community, which is why the IESO visited both proposed areas this week for open house sessions.

“The organization is committed to transparency and openness,” he said. “And that extends just beyond the regulatory sphere.”

Artificial intelligence is driving a surge of power consumption globally. Electricity demand from AI training and services is set to grow four-fold in the next 10 years, according to BloombergNEF. Although fossil fuels are expected to fill the initial gap, power generators such as Solaria are positioning themselves to supply renewable power as large technology companies have set ambitious clean-energy goals to operate the facilities in the long-run.

Spokespeople for Solaria and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

In the European Union alone, growing data-center energy demand implies as many as 35 gigawatts of new solar capacity may be needed through 2030, according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.

That’s led energy transition stocks, including Solaria, to surge in 2025. The Madrid-based company’s shares have soared 99% for the year to date.

In Spain, where power distribution networks are nearly saturated, Solaria has already secured data center grid access for 1.2 gigawatts and has about 3 gigawatts in clean-energy assets operating or under construction, as well as about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) of networks.

The company signed a memorandum of understanding in 2024 with Japan’s Datasection Inc. to build a data center with a capacity of as much as 200 megawatts in its plant in Puertollano.

The agreement entailed the construction of an AI facility in an area as large as 100,000 square meters (1,076,000 sq feet). The plant is equipped with highly insulated clean rooms, once used to make photo-voltaic cells, that would be adapted to house the technological component of the data centers.

That's why experts say to work in groups,CALEIGH WELLS,,,,,https://www.kens5.com/article/syndication/associatedpress/cop30-makes-individual-climate-actions-seem-small-thats-why-experts-say-to-work-in-groups/616-de59a5de-8820-459e-884f-dbd41a1dba6a,"Global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil.
Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute.
Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.","Global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,"" said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you're trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn't make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

""And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people's behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. ""Most people don’t even realize they’re there.""

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they're protesting or backing. If you like what they're doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn't much you can do about it. ""I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,"" he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

Many urgent actions are required to secure a livable planet and protect millions of lives. But all of them – every breakthrough, every shield of resilience – depend on one essential driver: financing.

On Saturday, discussions at the UN climate change conference, as the annual COPs are formally known, revolved around financial mobilization, or what leaders called the engine of climate transition.

A question of survival

Convening the Third High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance, COP30 heard from representatives of nations deeply affected by climate impacts, many of whom described access to financial resources as “a matter of survival.”

UN General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock said in her opening remarks that COP30 should mark the beginning of implementing up to $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance – disbursements that “reach those most in need, quickly, transparently and fairly.”

She stressed that climate action and social justice are “inseparable,” noting:

“Climate insecurity fuels hunger and poverty, poverty drives migration and conflict; and conflict, in turn, deepens poverty and deters investment.”

Breaking this vicious cycle, she said, is essential to deliver on global climate goals.

Renewable energy takes the lead

Reflecting on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, Ms. Baerbock recalled that in 2015, many delegates had been moved to tears by the historic outcome that produced the first legally binding global climate treaty, involving more than 190 countries.

She noted that at the time, renewable energy was widely considered “unrealistic.” Today, it is the fastest-growing energy source on Earth.

In 2024, global investment in clean energy reached $2 trillion – about $800 billion more than in fossil fuels. Solar power has become the cheapest form of electricity in history.

Africa’s untapped potential

Yet Ms. Baerbock warned that “vast potential remains untapped because capital is still not flowing to where it is most needed,” particularly in Africa.

More than 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity, even though the continent’s renewable energy potential is 50 times greater than the world’s projected electricity demand for 2040.

She urged developed nations to fulfill their technological and financial commitments and to advance reform of global financial institutions.

The ‘lifeblood’ of climate action

UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell also addressed the meeting, underscoring the transformative power of climate finance.

He described finance as the “lifeblood of climate action,” capable of turning “plans into progress” and “ambition into implementation.”

Mr. Stiell stressed that the most vulnerable countries continue to face major challenges, accessing funds that have long been pledged.

‘When finance flows, ambition grows’

Despite billions invested worldwide in clean energy, resilience and just transitions, Mr. Stiell said the total volume remains “neither sufficient nor predictable enough,” and not equitably shared.

At COP30, the world is looking for proof that climate cooperation delivers.

“Real finance, flowing fast and fair, is central to that proof,” he said, urging delegates to not only demonstrate that climate cooperation is working, but that investments made now can shape the “growth story of the 21st century.”

The UN climate chief emphasized:

“We are doing aquifer sustainability related research,” said Mark Hamilton, the executive director of aquifer management services at the Edwards Aquifer Authority.

Hamilton has worked for the authority for two decades.

“Working on this now almost five years,” Hamilton said. “And we feel like we have some of the best drought related data you could hope to have.”

In 2019, the aquifer acquired a property in northeast San Antonio where they focus on environmental research inside a 151-acre field research park.

“A lot of our work is based on improving soil health so that the soil will soak in more water,” Hamilton said. “It will hold more water. And it also provides a benefit to the ecosystem.”

Sustainability manger Thomas Marsalia says while some data is collected electronically, some — like soil samples — is collected manually.

Researchers are working to slow, sink and spread water runoff so that unnecessary debris won’t enter the creek.

“Giving nature a nudge in the right direction if you will,” Hamilton said. “Let it do what it already wants to do. So, we’re just trying to help.”

The Edwards Aquifer supplies water for 2 million people across Central Texas. The work being done at the research park is an effort to better preserve that resource.

Hamilton says healthy grasses and trees are like anchors to stabilize the soil — important even in a drought to maintain the aquifer.

“When this creek floods, if we don’t have this vegetation, you can imagine all of this soil is just going to get washed away,” Hamilton said.

Marsalia says man-made, one-rock dams are designed to slow down water and stabilize the soil.

“Just two rain events they’re almost covered up already,” Marsalia said. “In which a lot of this sediment would have just washed downstream if it weren’t for these structures.”

Preservation is a team effort. The experiments worked on in the field are all explained inside the Education Outreach Center, where families can learn about the aquifer’s conservation efforts for free.

This editorial is based on “Gauging the costs for clean energy transition” which was published in The Hindu Business Line on 10/11/2025. The article brings into picture the affordability of the clean energy transition for emerging economies, requiring just $121 billion by 2030, with India leading at $57 billion to raise renewables to 63% of capacity amid sharply falling solar, wind, and battery costs.

For Prelims: India’s clean energy transition,India’s COP26 commitment, International Energy Agency, National Green Hydrogen Mission, International Solar Alliance, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, Green Bonds, Critical minerals, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)

For Mains: Major Milestones in India’s Transition Towards Renewable Energy, Major Challenges Hindering India’s Renewable Energy Transition.

A new study reveals that the clean energy transition for emerging economies is far more affordable than previously thought. Between 2024 and 2030, nine major G20 emerging markets will need just $121 billion in climate finance for power generation, merely the incremental cost above business-as-usual investments. India leads this transformation, requiring $57 billion to boost its renewable share from 45% to 63% of installed capacity. Dramatically falling costs of solar, wind, and battery storage down 83%, 42%, and 90% respectively since 2010, have made this transition economically viable. For India specifically, while fossil-fuel power investments will decline by $43 billion, renewable spending must increase by $90 billion, positioning the country at the forefront of the green energy revolution with the largest climate finance requirement among emerging economies.

What are the Major Milestones in India’s Transition Towards Renewable Energy?

Surpassing the Non-Fossil Fuel Capacity Goal Ahead of Time: India has already achieved its COP26 commitment to have 50% of its installed electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, showcasing exceptional policy effectiveness and rapid execution.

This early achievement demonstrates a decoupling of energy growth from carbon-intensive sources, providing strong global confidence in India's net-zero 2070 pathway and enabling further ambitious clean energy targets.

As of September 2025, the installed non-fossil capacity has crossed 250 GW, representing over 50% of the country's total power capacity, successfully meeting the 2030 target five years early.

Global Leadership in Solar Capacity and Manufacturing Growth: Solar energy is the central pillar of the energy transition, and India is asserting itself as a global solar powerhouse through massive capacity addition and domestic manufacturing support.

The success of national schemes and low tariffs, driven by reverse auctions, makes solar the most cost-competitive and rapidly deployable source of new power generation, reducing the need for imported fuel.

India's cumulative solar capacity has reached around 130 GW (as of October 2025), and domestic solar module manufacturing capacity has nearly doubled from 38 GW to 74 GW in FY 2024–25, driven by the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.

Launch of the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM): The launch of the National Green Hydrogen Mission marks India's aggressive move to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like fertilizers, refining, and heavy industries, shifting the focus beyond just the power sector.

The mission establishes a comprehensive ecosystem for green hydrogen production and utilization, positioning India as a potential global hub for green hydrogen export, which is crucial for long-term energy security.

The mission targets developing a Green Hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) per annum by 2030, which is expected to attract over ₹8 lakh crore in total investments.

Decentralization of Renewable Energy through Rooftop Solar Schemes: A major shift is the focus on democratizing power generation, moving beyond large utility-scale projects to empower households and farmers as producers of clean energy.

The widespread adoption of decentralized solar, particularly rooftop and agricultural pumping, significantly reduces transmission losses, enhances grid resilience, and directly impacts consumer's electricity bills.

The PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched in February 2024 with a ₹75,021 crore outlay, targets rooftop solar installations in one crore households.

Financial Incentives for Energy Storage: Recognizing the intermittency challenge of solar and wind, the government has prioritized energy storage, including Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and pumped storage projects (PSP), to achieve a Round-the-Clock (RTC) reliable power supply.

The introduction of targeted financial mechanisms is essential to bridge the current cost gap, making storage projects viable and facilitating high penetration of variable renewables into the grid.

The Cabinet has approved a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for BESS, in September 2023 with an initial allocation to support the development of 4,000 MWh of BESS projects.

Advancing into the Frontier of Offshore Wind Energy: To diversify the renewable mix and exploit vast untapped potential, India is strategically moving into the high-capacity factor, higher-cost domain of offshore wind, which requires substantial government support.

This pioneering step opens a new vector for clean energy, especially along the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, simultaneously catalyzing a new domestic manufacturing and supply chain for large turbines and structures.

The government recently approved a VGF scheme of ₹7,453 crore for India's first 1 GW of offshore wind projects, targeting a potential of 30 GW by 2030.

What are the Major Challenges Hindering India’s Renewable Energy Transition?

Grid Instability and Curtailment due to Low Storage Capacity: The core challenge is the intermittency of solar and wind power, which is severely restricted by the lack of sufficient grid-scale energy storage and the inflexibility of traditional coal power plants.

This mismatch between daytime supply and evening demand forces operators to curtail or waste clean energy, undermining the economic viability of new projects and necessitating fossil fuel use during peak hours.

Recent data shows solar power curtailment rates in some regions rose to as high as 12% in late 2025, and on certain days, up to 40% of solar output was denied access to the grid due to oversupply, proving that capacity addition is outpacing grid readiness.

Pervasive Counterparty Risk and Financial Distress of DISCOMs: The financial health of state-owned Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) poses the single largest credit risk to renewable power developers, stemming from delayed payments for procured electricity.

These poor financials are rooted in high Transmission & Distribution (T&D) losses, poor billing/collection efficiency, and unrecovered costs due to subsidized tariffs, driving up the overall Cost of Debt for clean energy projects.

Also, Many distribution companies require 8 to 17 months of payment support to achieve a viable credit rating.

Deep Reliance on Imported Components and Raw Materials: Despite ambitious 'Make in India' and PLI schemes, the renewable energy supply chain, especially for solar and battery storage, remains heavily dependent on imports for crucial upstream components and critical minerals.

This import dependency exposes the sector to geopolitical risks, currency fluctuation, and global supply chain disruptions, threatening the long-term goal of energy sovereignty.

According to CEEW, India continues to rely heavily on imports of solar modules and lithium-ion batteries, with China accounting for nearly 80% of its battery imports in 2023.

Need for Massive and Affordable Climate Finance Mobilization: The transition requires colossal cumulative investment, and the domestic financial ecosystem, despite positive steps like Green Bonds, still lacks the depth and long-term, low-cost capital needed for capital-intensive, high-risk, emerging technologies like Green Hydrogen and Offshore Wind.

Without innovative blended finance and risk-sharing mechanisms, the cost of capital will remain high, making the transition significantly more expensive than planned.

To achieve its Net-Zero 2070 target, India is estimated to require $10 trillion in cumulative investments, yet it faces a huge long-term financing gap of approximately $3.5 trillion that must be bridged by external and innovative capital.

Regulatory and Contractual Inconsistencies Across States: The renewable energy framework is often hampered by inconsistent policy implementation and retroactive changes at the state level, creating significant regulatory uncertainty for investors and developers.

Ambiguities in areas like curtailment compensation, land acquisition rules, and Green Open Access implementation lead to prolonged legal disputes and deter much-needed long-term private investment.

Recent reports show that Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies have issued Letters of Award (LoAs) for over 43 GW of capacity where Power Sale Agreements (PSAs) with end procurers remained unsigned, reflecting market misalignment and uncertainty regarding project execution.

Land Acquisition Concern and End-of-Life Waste Management: The transition to utility-scale renewable energy is highly land-intensive, creating unavoidable conflicts over land use—often leading to the displacement of communities, diversion of grazing/agricultural land, and contentious land acquisition processes that raise issues of inadequate compensation, consent, and transparency.

Furthermore, the future challenge of managing e-waste from retired solar panels and batteries is a ticking environmental time bomb that requires the immediate scaling up of national recycling infrastructure to avoid future ecological damage.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India currently generates around 100,000 tonnes of solar waste, but by 2030 this figure could swell to 600,000 tonnes.

Critical Shortage of a Skilled Green Workforce and Training Mismatch: Despite the promise of ""green jobs,"" the rapid scaling of the sector is severely constrained by a significant skills gap and a mismatch between academic curricula and cutting-edge industry needs.

This shortfall affects everything from highly-specialized manufacturing and R&D roles to basic project installation and maintenance, leading to project delays and sub-optimal operational efficiency.

India is projected to face a critical shortage of 1.2 million skilled workers in the renewable sector by 2030, directly impacting project timelines and costs.

Regional Disparities and Energy Access: Some regions will face far greater social and economic impacts during the clean-energy transition than others.

For example, coal-dependent states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha may experience job losses and revenue decline, while renewable-rich states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu stand to gain from increased investment and green jobs.

This uneven distribution complicates the goal of ensuring a nationally just and balanced transition.

Weak Data Governance and Transparency: Inadequate, inconsistent, or delayed energy-sector data severely limits informed policy-making and undermines efficient market functioning.

The absence of real-time, verified data on generation, storage, transmission capacity, and state-level transition progress reduces accountability, weakens investor confidence, and restricts the ability to design evidence-based interventions.

Also, lack of standardization and granularity provides fertile ground for ""greenwashing,"" undermines the credibility of climate commitments, and increases due diligence costs for investors trying to accurately assess portfolio-wide environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk.

What Steps Can India Take to Fast-Track Its Renewable Energy Transition?

Implement Performance-Linked Financial Discipline for DISCOMs: Financial viability of Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) must be secured through a non-negotiable performance-based funding model, moving away from past bailout failures.

This requires a strict, enforced linkage of central government funding (like RDSS) to tangible, measurable reductions in Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses, full cost-reflective tariffs, and mandatory Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of subsidies.

The measure involves mandating real-time digital monitoring of loss reduction targets and strictly enforcing the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) Rules to ensure timely payments to generating companies (GENCOs), thus dramatically reducing counterparty risk for private investors.

Establish a National Grid Flexibility Market and Storage Mandate: Treat grid flexibility and energy storage as a standalone, essential service, rather than a mere ancillary component of solar and wind projects, to incentivize rapid deployment and manage intermittency.

This requires launching a market mechanism for fast-response resources and dynamic dispatch, fully valuing the services provided by Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), Pumped Storage Projects (PSP), and gas-peaker plants.

This measure involves the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issuing a National Energy Storage Obligation (NESO) framework, replacing the current Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) system, with targets that explicitly define the MWh storage capacity required for Round-the-Clock (RTC) power.

Launch a Green Hydrogen Demand Creation Mandate: To realize the ambitious Green Hydrogen Mission, the government must strategically create anchor demand by mandating blending quotas in key high-carbon industries, providing the crucial offtake certainty needed for massive project financing.

This policy signal de-risks early investments in large-scale electrolyser manufacturing and downstream infrastructure, accelerating cost decline curves through guaranteed economies of scale.

The measure involves notifying a mandatory Green Hydrogen consumption quota for core ""hard-to-abate"" sectors, starting with fertilizer production, petroleum refining, and steel, alongside Viability Gap Funding (VGF) schemes targeted specifically at early commercial-scale Green Ammonia export facilities.

Enable Virtual Net Metering and Decentralized Energy Trading: Rooftop solar growth must transition from individual house installations to a community-wide, virtual model to overcome physical rooftop limitations and fully leverage the potential of distributed generation across urban areas.

This requires enabling regulatory frameworks for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading and Virtual Net Metering (VNM) across multiple locations owned by one entity or within cooperative societies.

The measure involves the Ministry of Power (MoP) amending the Green Open Access Rules to allow aggregated VNM for commercial and residential complexes, incentivizing land-constrained entities to invest in off-site or shared community solar projects, drastically increasing the urban adoption rate.

Create Single-Window Mega-Site Clearances for RE Zones: Long-standing delays in land acquisition, Right-of-Way (ROW), and inter-state transmission clearances remain the biggest execution bottleneck, necessitating a radical simplification of the permitting process.

A dedicated, fast-track mechanism for nationally significant projects would cut down the time from tender award to commissioning, dramatically improving project execution timelines.

This measure involves establishing ""Renewable Energy Investment Zones (REIZ)"" with pre-cleared land banks, pre-approved environmental permits, and a Single Project Clearance Board comprising Central and State representatives, reducing the average project approval cycle from over 18 months to less than 6 months.

Upskill Human Capital through Specialized Green Technology Institutes: Current engineering and vocational training pipeline is insufficient for the demands of highly technical, next-generation renewable technologies like high-efficiency TOPCon cells, large-scale BESS deployment, and offshore wind maintenance.

A coordinated national effort to create a specialized workforce is essential for sustained growth and true self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat).

The measure involves launching a National Green Skill Development Mission to create Centres of Excellence (CoEs) in partnership with industry leaders, focusing on Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, Green Hydrogen plant operations, and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) deployment and data analytics.

Mandate Retrofit Flexibility in Existing Coal Power Fleet: The argument is that instead of outright immediate retirement, a cost-effective and immediate strategy for grid stability is to mandate technical retrofits (e.g., boiler modifications) in the existing coal power fleet to enable flexible operation and two-shift cycling capability.

This ensures that traditional plants can ramp up and down quickly to support high variable Renewable Energy (RE) penetration, effectively serving as a synthetic energy storage solution until BESS costs decline further.

The measure involves the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) issuing new technical standards that make flexible operation mandatory for all thermal power plants older than 15 years, penalizing plants that fail to meet minimum ramp rates and offering incentives for fast part-load operation.

Accelerate Bioenergy Deployment Across Sectors: Bioenergy provides both waste-management solutions and clean energy. India can scale up by:

Converting agricultural residues (e.g., crop stubble) and municipal solid waste into energy, reducing pollution while generating power

Producing liquid biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel to decarbonize road transport

Expanding gaseous biofuels such as Compressed Biogas (CBG) under initiatives like SATAT for use in vehicles, shipping, and aviation. This supports circular economy goals and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.

Deepen International Collaboration and Cross-Border Energy Cooperation: India’s leadership in global platforms must be leveraged further:

International Solar Alliance (ISA), Mission Innovation, and India’s climate leadership during G20 have positioned India as both a provider and recipient of green technology and finance

Strengthen regional electricity trade with ASEAN, SAARC, BIMSTEC, and emerging green hydrogen partnerships with the Middle East

Promote joint R&D, battery storage innovation, and low-cost finance through multilateral cooperation. This accelerates technology diffusion and lowers financing costs.

Promote Community Participation and Gender Inclusion: A people-centric transition ensures long-term success. This includes: Community ownership models, local co-operatives, and revenue-sharing frameworks for solar and wind projects

Gender-focused interventions that increase women’s workforce participation, leadership roles, and access to green livelihood opportunities.

Such measures build trust, improve adoption rates, and make energy transitions socially sustainable.

Towards Just Transition: India must ensure that coal-dependent states and vulnerable workers are not left behind. This includes: Reskilling and redeployment of coal-sector workers, diversifying state economies (e.g., Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha)

Without a just transition, rapid shifts may trigger social resistance, widening regional inequalities.

Even well-intentioned policies—such as the E20 fuel policy or Delhi’s vehicle scrappage policy—risk backlash if introduced without adequate preparedness, supply-chain readiness, or public awareness.

India must ensure phased rollouts, stakeholder consultations, infrastructure readiness, and affordability safeguards to avoid disrupting livelihoods and mobility.

Conclusion:

India’s renewable energy transition stands at a decisive inflection point driven by technological advances, strong policy backing, and falling costs. Yet, realizing its full potential demands financial innovation, institutional reforms, and grid modernization. Accelerating this shift will not only secure energy independence but also generate green jobs and inclusive growth. Aligned with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), India’s transition embodies the path toward a sustainable and resilient future.

Buying electric vehicles from the end of September and on will no longer net you any tax breaks at the end of the year.","Products rise and fall like the changing tides of the sea. Some go away, new ones launch — it's a never-ending dance between manufacturers and consumers that touches nearly every industry, including automotive. Vehicles can get phased out because they don't sell well, new or improved models become available, or something else entirely, like the parent company going under. In any case, there are a host of electric vehicles on the market this year that look like they won't be around for much longer, and certainly not in 2026.

If you're interested in owning one, you might want to hurry up and order, funds willing, because once they're gone, they're probably gone for good. Depending on how much used stock is available, that may or may not be an exaggeration. It depends on the market and how in demand these vehicles truly are.

Just to provide a few quick examples, some electric vehicles that are already gone, but not forgotten, include the Ford Focus Electric, Ford Ranger EV, Fiat 500e, BMW i3 (here's what happened), Toyota RAV4 EV, and Chevrolet S-10 EV (here are 13 EVs that have been discontinued in the U.S.). As for the electric vehicles that won't make it to 2026, here are five others that will make a few folks wince.

In September 2025, Acura officially announced that the ZDX, its first electric vehicle, would be discontinued. Part of the reason is because of slow EV adoption across the board, causing some automakers to backtrack on EVs. The electric model of the ZDX debuted in 2024, just a year prior to its cancellation. While not necessarily a standout in its class, the Acura ZDX is capable and enjoys a roomy interior. It features good fuel economy ratings (for an EV, anyway), with 313 miles per charge estimated for the rear-wheel-drive version and 278 miles per charge for the all-wheel-drive model. (The real-world results are lower for the all-wheel-drive model, according to Car and Driver's test of the vehicle.) Of course, if you know what you're doing, you can extend your electric vehicle's range in a few ways, hybrid or all-electric included. That could help eke out a little more range out of something like the Acura ZDX EV.

The ZDX EV was a suitable alternative to the Chevy Equinox, though a bit pricier than some of the other options in its class. That may change now that it's being discontinued, especially when it comes to used and pre-owned models. It remains to be seen how or if the discontinuation will change demand going forward. For now, it's worth noting that if you've been looking into the ZDX, you might want to pull the trigger soon. Or, you could wait until prices drop and dealerships are clearing out excess stock.

Dodge unveiled the Ram 1500 REV, an all-electric full-sized truck, in 2023, but it never quite made it to market. After several delays, Ram officially cancelled plans in September 2025, which means its rendition of a supercharged electric truck will never see the light of day. According to the company, it did so because of the slow demand for EVs in North America, but it's entirely likely the hassle wasn't worth the investment in the end. Consumer reports show that EV trucks are among some of the least reliable on the market, after all. You won't be able to buy the Ram 1500 EV new or used — you won't even be able to buy this model at all, actually. But don't fret: If you are looking for an EV truck, the REV models are staying in production, like the plug-in hybrid Ram 1500 planned to release soon.

The all-EV model is gone, but the Ram 1500 Ramcharger is still around the corner. The extended-range hybrid has two electric motors working together to produce 663 horsepower and 615 pound-feet of torque. It also uses a liquid-cooled battery pack offering up to 141 miles per charge. But that, too, has been delayed a year — it's set to release in early 2026 — and it remains to be seen what changes or upgrades will make it into the production model. The all-electric Ram 1500, on the other hand, was only ever a concept, and that's all it will ever be now.

The Dodge Charger electric, the Daytona EV, comes in two trims for the 2025 model year, the Scat Pack and the R/T. Well, after just a year in production, Dodge is already phasing out the Daytona R/T model, leaving the would-be electric muscle drivers with just one option in 2026. While the EV model will technically still be around, which is a positive, it's sad to see some of that variety go. There are also rumors that Dodge cancelled development of another, even more powerful model called the Banshee EV. It's unfortunate to see because it's not like the muscle car EV market is flooded with options.

The model saying bye was capable of 496 horsepower, had all-wheel drive, and gave 308 miles per charge, a slightly better fuel economy than the 241 miles from the Scat Pack. No doubt the range difference is due to the higher horsepower and better performance in the Scat Pack model. Still, with a 0 to 60 miles per hour time at 4.7 seconds, the Dodge Charger Daytona R/T was impressively fast, but it didn't come close to some of the fastest electric vehicles in the world. That doesn't really matter, though — it still stings to see an EV that's fun to drive go away, even if it is only half of the model being postponed.

Launched in 2023, the Nissan Ariya EV is apparently no more. According to the automaker, production has been officially halted for the U.S. market, but Nissan did say ""paused"" and not necessarily discontinued. The company has mentioned they're reallocating resources to the Leaf EV, another electric vehicle, so it's not abandoning the technology completely. The Leaf is also going to be more accessible, with a lower planned MSRP, which could be another reason why the Ariya is being phased out.

The 2025 Nissan Ariya is a compact all-electric SUV. Drivers can expect 205 miles from the Engage e-4orce model to 289 miles per charge from the Evolve+ option, and there's plenty of room inside with five available seats. It features a handsome yet unique design inside and out. The sophisticated cabin is a stunner, which is what makes the loss of this vehicle sting a little, more so because it's only been on the market for a short while. It will be interesting to see how well-received the upcoming Nissan Leaf EV is and also how long that one stays in production versus the Ariya's short but notable run. It does seem like most manufacturers are shifting focus to hybrid models overall rather than all-electric models, likely due to market demand cooling.

The Genesis Electrified G80 was an electric car that looked nothing like an electric car. From the outside, you'd probably clock it as a luxury sedan, and that was certainly the goal. But it was also pretty expensive, starting at $77,000, up to an estimated $82,000 depending on the trim and features you choose. Maybe that's why it didn't sell as well, or maybe it's just that EVs in general aren't as exciting. Either way, Genesis announced that the Electrified model won't be returning in 2026. Initially, the company simply removed the vehicle's information from its website. It seemed like the EV would go quietly into the night, but Genesis did eventually make an announcement through the media.

What is somewhat surprising, if you can call it that, is that the Genesis Electrified G80 faithfully recreated the bulky sedan styling of its gas-powered sibling, the standard G80. People still weren't buying it. It appears consumers aren't all that interested in EVs that mimic gas counterparts well, beyond your average electric model, possibly indicating that no EVs are going to land the popular vote. No matter what they achieve and what they look, sound, or feel like. There's also the point that the federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases expired in September 2025. Buying electric vehicles from the end of September and on will no longer net you any tax breaks at the end of the year.",https://www.bgr.com/img/gallery/5-electric-vehicles-that-wont-make-it-to-2026/l-intro-1762266973.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 13:59:32.633827

The Bureau of Land Management will move forward with managing the reserve under new 2025 regulations that align with those originally established in 1977, according to the Department of the Interior website. The Biden administration in 2024 had begun to study and seek public input on the need for additional environmental protections for certain lands on Alaska’s North Slope.

“By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.”

The action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to “modernize resource policy in Alaska,” according to the Interior Department. In October, the department announced actions that include reopening the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing and the completion of right-of-way permits for the Ambler Road project, which would provide access to an area rich in critical metals.

Other actions to increase Alaska energy production include a land exchange to facilitate the construction of a road between King Cove and the airport at Cold Bay which will convey approximately 490 acres within the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to King Cove Corporation in exchange for 1,739 acres to be added to another part of the refuge.

Could the EU-Serbia Lithium Agreement Signal Your Next Investment Opportunity?","Understanding the EU-Serbia Lithium Agreement Framework

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement represents a fundamental shift in Europe's approach to critical mineral security, establishing comprehensive frameworks that extend far beyond traditional extraction partnerships. This strategic alliance operates through five interconnected pillars designed to create an integrated battery materials ecosystem spanning raw material extraction, processing, manufacturing, and workforce development.

The partnership emerged under the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), which entered into force on June 14, 2024, providing the legal foundation for Europe's diversified mineral sourcing strategy. Furthermore, this initiative aligns closely with broader critical minerals energy transition strategies across the continent. The CRMA establishes a tiered approach where strategic projects receive coordinated EU institutional support, member state backing, and enhanced financing access through mechanisms including European Investment Bank loans and Innovation Fund resources.

Strategic Implementation Architecture

The agreement's operational structure integrates multiple governance layers to ensure comprehensive supply chain security. Strategic projects designated under the CRMA receive priority treatment through coordinated Commission resources, while supply chain partnerships create integrated frameworks connecting extraction to European manufacturing capabilities.

Key implementation mechanisms include:

• Value chain development for raw materials and electric vehicle integration

• Research collaboration initiatives linking Serbian geological expertise with European battery technology

• Environmental and social governance standards embedded throughout operations

• Financial instrument mobilization through EU funding programs

• Workforce development programs targeting high-quality employment opportunities

In June 2025, the European Commission officially designated Serbia's Jadar project among 13 strategic critical materials initiatives in third countries, positioning it as a cornerstone of Europe's mineral security architecture.

Serbia's Jadar Project: Technical Specifications and Market Impact

The Jadar Valley development serves as the primary driver of the EU-Serbia lithium agreement, containing an estimated 200 million tonnes of lithium-borate ore with approximately 2.4 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE). This deposit's significance stems not from absolute size but from its strategic geographic proximity to European markets and processing infrastructure.

Project Specifications and Production Capacity

Metric Value Estimated Reserves 200 million tonnes lithium-borate ore Lithium Carbonate Equivalent 2.4 million tonnes LCE Potential EU Market Share 10-15% of lithium demand Annual Production Capacity 50,000-75,000 tonnes LCE EV Production Support 1.1 million vehicles annually Projected Revenue (10 years) €4 billion Serbian Treasury Revenue €300 million

The project's 10-15% of European lithium demand translates to approximately 50,000-75,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent annually, based on current EU consumption patterns of 500,000-750,000 tonnes LCE per year. This production capacity theoretically supports 1.1 million electric vehicles annually, assuming approximately 75 kg of lithium carbonate equivalent per EV battery pack.

Technical Processing Requirements

Jadar's lithium-borate ore composition requires specialized processing methodology distinct from conventional hard-rock lithium extraction or geothermal lithium extraction techniques. The ore processing involves:

• Acid leaching of boron-containing lithium silicate formations

• Lithium hydroxide precipitation following solvent extraction

• Water consumption of approximately 500-800 gallons per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent

• Processing timeline targeting 2030-2032 commercial production commencement

Unlike lithium resources in South America's Lithium Triangle or Australian lithium innovations, Jadar offers substantially reduced transportation costs and supply chain complexity, potentially reducing final battery manufacturing costs by 8-12% compared to non-European sourcing.

Economic Impact Analysis and Benefit Distribution

Serbian officials project the EU-Serbia lithium agreement will generate approximately 20,000 new employment opportunities across the lithium value chain, encompassing direct mining operations, processing facilities, manufacturing, and supply chain support services.

Employment Distribution Analysis

The 20,000 employment figure breaks down across multiple economic sectors:

• Direct Employment: 2,000-4,000 jobs in mining and processing operations

• Indirect Employment: 6,000-8,000 jobs in supply chain support, equipment provision, and logistics

• Induced Employment: 8,000-10,000 jobs from secondary economic activity generated by wage spending

This employment multiplier effect assumes approximately 3-5 secondary jobs created per direct mining position, consistent with International Monetary Fund estimates for extractive industries in Central and Eastern European economies.

Revenue Distribution Concerns

Financial analysis reveals significant disparities in benefit distribution, with €4 billion in projected 10-year revenues generating only €300 million (7.5%) flowing to Serbian Treasury. This benefit-sharing ratio reflects patterns observed in other developing-economy mineral extraction projects, where operator profits typically represent 70-85% of total value.

The 92.5% value capture by international operators versus 7.5% to local government suggests limited Serbian negotiating leverage, particularly considering global capital requirements for large-scale lithium processing infrastructure.

Downstream Manufacturing Integration

Beyond extraction, the agreement encompasses downstream processing through partnerships including InoBat AG's battery manufacturing facility. The Slovak company committed to factory construction beginning in 2025, supported by €419 million in Serbian government subsidies.

However, battery manufacturing value chain analysis reveals:

• Raw materials: 15-20% of final cell value

• Cell production labour: 10-15% of value

• Technology licensing and IP: 40-50% of value

• Capital equipment: 15-20% of value

This distribution indicates that 80-90% of battery cell manufacturing value typically accrues to technology licensing and intellectual property holders rather than host countries.

Environmental Opposition and Water Resource Concerns

Environmental groups cite multiple technical risks associated with the EU-Serbia lithium agreement's implementation, focusing particularly on water resource protection and community displacement concerns.

Water Contamination Risk Assessment

The Jadar River valley system serves approximately 100,000-150,000 people in surrounding agricultural regions dependent on river water for irrigation and domestic consumption. Environmental opposition focuses on three specific technical risks:

1. Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)

Boron-rich lithium ore oxidation produces sulfuric acid capable of dissolving heavy metals (aluminium, iron, manganese) into groundwater systems. Without perpetual active management, AMD contamination can persist 50-100+ years post-mining operations.

2. Saline Discharge Impact

Lithium extraction produces high-salinity wastewater that, if released into freshwater aquifers, renders water unusable for agriculture due to osmotic stress effects on crop production systems.

3. Cumulative Contamination Loading

Industrial operations within 50 kilometres, including phosphate fertiliser plants and copper smelters, create compound contamination risks if lithium mining adds pollution loading to existing stressed water systems.

Aquifer Vulnerability Analysis

The Jadar Valley aquifer sits approximately 50-200 metres below surface in regions of moderate geological containment, presenting theoretical contamination risks if spillage or seepage occurs during processing operations.

Lithium processing water requirements of 500-800 gallons per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent produced raises sustainability concerns given regional water availability constraints. Consequently, proper mine reclamation innovation becomes essential for long-term environmental protection.

Permitting Process Transparency Issues

In 2021, the Serbian government revoked Rio Tinto's permits following mass protests, indicating both public opposition success and government responsiveness to pressure. This permit revocation delayed project commencement by approximately 3-4 years (2021-2024/2025 recovery phase).

Recent political developments have revived project prospects, though environmental groups continue challenging transparency in:

• Environmental baseline data availability and accessibility

• Independent verification processes separate from operator assessments

• Community consent mechanisms enabling meaningful local participation

• Adaptive management requirements with permit suspension triggers

Europe's Supply Chain Diversification Strategy

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement operates within Europe's broader strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese-controlled mineral processing and supply chains. China currently controls approximately 60-70% of global lithium processing capacity despite controlling only 15-20% of primary lithium reserves.

Strategic Diversification Mechanisms

Since 2021, the European Union has established critical materials partnerships with 14 countries, creating a diversified network including Argentina (lithium), Norway (rare earths), and Zambia (copper and cobalt). This multi-country approach operates through dual mechanisms:

1. Supply Source Diversification

Reducing reliance on single-source lithium suppliers, particularly Chile's dominance of 28-32% of global production and Australia's 50-55% of hard-rock production output.

2. Processing Repatriation

Building European battery manufacturing and lithium processing capacity to reduce Chinese value-capture dominance, as approximately 85% of lithium battery cell production currently occurs in China or China-adjacent Asian facilities.

Climate Neutrality Timeline Alignment

The partnership directly supports the EU's 2050 climate neutrality objectives established under European Climate Law (EU Regulation 2021/1119). Interim targets include:

• 2030: 55% greenhouse gas emission reduction compared to 1990 levels

• 2035: Phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicle sales

• 2040: 90% emission reduction milestone

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement provides essential materials for renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle production necessary to achieve these legally binding targets.

Governance Challenges and Democratic Oversight

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement faces significant governance challenges related to democratic oversight, transparency, and accountability mechanisms within Serbia's current political framework.

Democratic Institution Concerns

Critics argue that Serbia's governance framework lacks sufficient transparency and accountability mechanisms for responsible resource management. Concerns about rule of law, media freedom, and democratic institutions raise questions about effective oversight implementation throughout the project lifecycle.

Parliamentary Opposition Response

Serbian opposition parties have consistently challenged lithium mining through legislative channels. In September 2024, parliament rejected an opposition bill proposing a complete ban on lithium mining activities, highlighting ongoing domestic political divisions regarding the project's implementation.

The parliamentary opposition argues that the EU-Serbia lithium agreement proceeds without adequate public consultation and democratic approval processes, potentially circumventing constitutional requirements for major resource development decisions.

Institutional Capacity Questions

Effective environmental monitoring and enforcement require institutional capacity that may exceed current Serbian regulatory capabilities. Key concerns include:

• Technical expertise for ongoing environmental monitoring

• Financial resources for independent oversight operations

• Legal frameworks enabling permit suspension or modification

• International arbitration mechanisms for dispute resolution

Automotive Industry Strategic Partnerships

Major international automakers view the EU-Serbia lithium agreement as a strategic opportunity to establish integrated supply chains from extraction through vehicle production, reducing dependence on Asian supply chains.

Direct Supply Chain Integration

Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis have expressed interest in establishing direct supply agreements with Serbian lithium operations, creating vertically integrated supply chains that could provide competitive advantages in electric vehicle manufacturing costs and supply chain resilience.

These partnerships potentially enable:

• Cost reduction of 8-12% compared to non-European sourcing

• Supply security independent of geopolitical disruptions in maritime chokepoints

• Quality control through integrated processing and manufacturing systems

• Carbon footprint reduction via shortened transportation distances

Battery Technology Development

The agreement facilitates collaboration between European battery technology developers and Serbian mineral resources, potentially creating competitive advantages in next-generation battery chemistry research and development.

European automakers are particularly interested in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technologies that could utilise Jadar's specific ore composition for cost-effective energy storage solutions in mass-market electric vehicles. In addition, this collaboration aligns with broader trends in mining industry evolution towards more sustainable practices.

Balkan Geopolitical Implications

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement carries significant implications for regional power dynamics and Serbia's complex geopolitical positioning between European integration and traditional alliances with Russia and China.

EU Accession Process Considerations

The partnership raises critical questions about how resource extraction agreements interact with Serbia's EU accession negotiations. Traditional accession processes emphasise governance reform requirements, rule of law strengthening, and democratic institution building.

Some analysts worry that economic partnerships might overshadow these governance reform requirements, potentially allowing Serbia to access EU economic benefits without implementing comprehensive democratic reforms expected of membership candidates. However, critics argue this approach undermines democratic values within EU expansion strategies.

Regional Influence Dynamics

This agreement positions Serbia as a strategically important partner in Europe's green transition, potentially affecting regional relationships and Serbia's diplomatic balancing act between major powers.

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement may influence:

• Regional competition with other Balkan states seeking EU investment

• Russian influence in Serbian domestic politics and energy policy

• Chinese Belt and Road Initiative projects in the Western Balkans

• NATO relations and regional security cooperation frameworks

Long-term Strategic Positioning

Serbia's role as a critical minerals supplier could provide enhanced negotiating leverage in future EU accession discussions, while potentially creating economic dependencies that limit policy autonomy in other areas.

The agreement establishes Serbia as a strategic energy transition partner rather than merely an accession candidate, potentially altering traditional EU expansion dynamics in the Western Balkans region.

Investment and Market Psychology Considerations

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement reflects broader shifts in critical minerals investment psychology, driven by supply chain security concerns rather than purely economic optimisation considerations.

Risk Premium Calculations

European willingness to accept higher extraction costs in Serbia compared to established suppliers reflects geopolitical risk premiums increasingly incorporated into strategic planning. The agreement prioritises supply security over short-term cost minimisation, indicating fundamental shifts in resource investment criteria.

Market Timing and Cyclical Factors

Lithium market dynamics suggest the agreement's timing may coincide with supply shortage periods projected for 2026-2030, when global electric vehicle adoption could outpace production capacity increases from traditional sources.

This timing positions the EU-Serbia lithium agreement to capture premium pricing during anticipated supply constraints, potentially improving project economics beyond baseline financial projections.

Coal was first discovered in West Virginia in 1742, natural gas was first struck in 1815, and the state’s first oil-producing well was completed in 1860. Each of these discoveries happened before West Virginia was recognized as the nation’s 35th state. In fact, West Virginians were enjoying public electric streetlamps a full three years before electric lights were installed in the White House in 1891. When it comes to energy, West Virginia has always led the way.

West Virginia energy has been used to fortify our country, connect our communities with reliable infrastructure, and provide affordable electricity that Americans need and deserve across our country. This duty is part of the shared identity between West Virginians and is a central aspect of the culture and history here that has withstood the test of time. That tradition is something to be proud of, and something that Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration are committed to continuing.

West Virginians know too well the attacks that have targeted our way of life, first by President Obama and later by President Biden. These attacks sought to harm our states’ energy and infrastructure industries. Thankfully, we’ve been able to work together to right the wrongs of the Obama and Biden EPA in just the first 300 days of the Trump administration, and our visits across West Virginia this past week highlighted the impact our policies are making.

We began by hosting a roundtable discussion in Charleston with energy and manufacturing leaders who are making important investments in energy security and economic development. We’ve reached a pivotal moment for American energy and manufacturing, America’s economic backbone, and how we strengthen these industries today will shape the future of communities across the nation. In talking with industry leaders, it was clear that quick deregulatory actions by EPA this year are already making a difference.

Next, we visited the John Amos Power Plant in Winfield to see operations firsthand as coal-fired electricity generation is increasingly necessary to meet power demand. For years, we have warned about the consequences of Democrats’ “Clean Power Plan 2.0” that aimed to shut down power generation through coal and natural gas. Under President Trump’s leadership and his support for coal, EPA has begun the process of ending this reckless and unconstitutional policy, and is making needed investments in coal-fired power from states like West Virginia.

We then visited the Toyota plant in Buffalo that employs thousands of West Virginians to meet with their leadership and hear about their growth over the past year. Facilities like Toyota were under threat from the Biden administration’s EV mandate that would have banned the sale of gas-powered cars across 30% of the U.S. market, eliminating jobs and consumer choice. The good news is that we worked together to reverse this policy earlier this year and preserve employment opportunities up and down the automotive supply chain. West Virginians don’t want an EV mandate, and we’re proud to have led efforts to protect American workers and consumers from this radical and drastic policy.

Finally, we traveled to Apple Grove and visited Nucor Steel as they move toward becoming fully operational. Nucor Steel is vital to manufacturing in West Virginia and has already made a major economic impact. Nucor also provides an important perspective on our country’s broken permitting and environmental review process, as lengthy delays and red tape nearly halted the facility’s construction. The Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have made permitting reform a central priority and continue to work to reform this burdensome process while ensuring our environment continues to be protected.

Our visits displayed directly how early successes and policies we’re working on in Washington are making a difference in West Virginia. Our country needs to be able to build again, we need to be able to generate reliable and affordable electricity, and we must be able to invest in our communities. Together, the EPA and the EPW Committee are working to unleash American energy, spur economic development, and create good-paying jobs while always protecting the air, land, and water of our communities.

While this is a great start, more work remains to be done, and we’ll continue to work for West Virginians and Americans across our great nation.

Laborup screens workers like machinists, technicians and welders to create free profiles that show off their skills. The process is designed to connect recruiters to blue-collar workers, rather than workers having to apply for dozens (or hundreds) of jobs.

Nearly 40,000 users in East Tennessee have been screened on the platform, said Simba Jonga, the app's founder and CEO and an alumnus of the University of Tennessee. Laborup reports an average 30% pay increase for its users.

While the platform is available to users around the U.S., it launched in 2024 with a focus on East Tennessee. It has since expanded its focus statewide and into Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina and Ohio.

The company has an office in Knoxville focused on sales and business operations and an office in Nashville focused on software engineering, with around 15 employees between them. Chattanooga makes sense as the next market to attract users and potentially open an office, Jonga said on a visit to the city.

Chattanooga is home to heavy equipment manufacturers like Astec and Miller Industries and a hub for logistics. Manufacturing is the third-largest employment sector in Chattanooga, with 40,500 jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""It's really at this nexus of the different states we want to expand into,"" Jonga said in an interview. ""There's a reason why logistics boomed here ... Everything has to go through Chattanooga at some point.""

Users can create a Laborup profile in a web browser like Google Chrome or Safari. The start-up plans to launch a mobile app in December as it attracts more users in urban areas, Jonga said.

Laborup uses artificial intelligence to build detailed profiles faster than individual human recruiters can. Its primary value is for employers who spend lots of money and time hiring workers, only to lose them a shortly thereafter.

Laborup says it speeds hiring processes by five to 10 times, increases retention by over three times and costs companies more than 50% less than traditional hiring processes.

""Usually, the person we're talking to is a stressed-out operations manager or HR manager,"" Jonga said. ""They're in a hiring crunch. There's a lot of downtime. Machines are not running because they don't have enough people.""

The app is like a LinkedIn focused on blue-collar workers and employers, and it has attracted major Silicon Valley investors.

MILLIONS RAISED

Laborup raised $7.7 million in two fundraising rounds in 2024 and 2025, it announced in August. Its individual investors include Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Jeff Jordan, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and a board member at Airbnb.

The app has some of the same early investors as platforms like LinkedIn did. This provides a major advantage for getting connected to clients, Jonga said.

""Most of these investors are usually making 10 to 20 unique investments a year, so it's largely about the mission,"" Jonga said. ""It helps a ton to share an early investor with a company, because usually they have the ear of the CEO.""

Jonga, who immigrated to Tennessee with his family from South Africa as a teenager, graduated from UT in 2022. He studied AI as a graduate student at Stanford University before taking leave to create Laborup in 2023.

The app's clients include East Tennessee manufacturers from Bush's Beans in Knoxville to HCB Yachts in Vonore. Its broad focus so far is industries that cut or shape metal.

Laborup is designed to attract clients in markets that are growing quickly, like the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge or the distribution industry in Nashville, Jonga said. The startup has met with Siskin Steel in Chattanooga.

Laborup begins the process of working with companies by indexing the physical layout of their plants, including the number of machines and floor plan.

""What you do, and the machines you have and the people you have and those work instructions determine who you're trying to hire,"" Jonga said. ""We want to understand the whole operation of the company.""

Jonga said Laborup wants to expand its work with chemical companies like Wacker, which operates a large polysilicon plant in Bradley County north of Chattanooga.

Wacker, Astec and Miller Industries are among Hamilton County employers that laid off workers earlier this year. Some local business leaders pointed to tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump as a cause of uncertainty in their markets.

State and federal data, however, points to growth in manufacturing and a growing need for workers.

THE OPPORTUNITY

Tennessee's advanced energy sector, which includes nuclear power and electric vehicle manufacturing, generated $56 billion of gross domestic product and supported nearly 421,000 jobs with an average salary of $74,000 in 2024, according to a report from the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council.

Manufacturing is projected to be the state's second-largest sector by employment through 2032, behind health care and social assistance, according to state data. Workers in the sector saw wage growth as the average hourly pay rose from $23.68 to $24.54 in 2024.

But many jobs in the sector go unfilled. There were 409,000 job openings in the U.S. manufacturing industry in August, down from 438,000 in July, according to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The bureau has not published employment reports for two months during the longest government shutdown in history.)

(READ MORE: Chattanooga start-up uses AI to make podcasters more money)

The sector could have 3.8 million job openings by 2033, according to a report from the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte.

Recruiting and retaining quality workers was cited by 47% of manufacturers as a top challenge in a quarterly survey published in September by the National Association of Manufacturers.

Laborup hopes to take advantage of a moment when bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. is a bipartisan issue.

""We firmly believe it's the greatest country in the world, and I think you can't not have an industrial base,"" Jonga said. ""The physical world is still the substrate, even for the services of the software world.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/11/17/103848168_073125-MASTER-MACHINE-003_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-11-15 13:01:59.781269

Today, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava alongside the Department of Solid Waste Management (DSWM) County officials and the Miami-Dade Innovation Authority (MDIA) proudly announced the winners of MDIA’s fifth public innovation challenge. This challenge focused on solutions that will divert waste, particularly organic waste, from County landfills, enhance recycling efforts, and strengthen strategies to reduce waste and educate and engage residents.

Miami-Dade County produces over five million tons of waste annually. According to Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) only 37 percent of the County’s waste is actually recycled with a contamination rate of approximately 39 percent. Piloting innovative technologies and easy‑to‑use tools will help the County increase recycling participation, divert more material, increase re-use of organic waste and recyclables, and reduce environmental impact.

The announcement event included demonstrations of the three winning technology solutions. Beginning in 2026, two of the startups will participate in a pilot test conducted at South Dade Landfill and Old South Dade Landfill; the other pilot will be deployed county-wide to educate residents on how to sort their waste. The selected winners include two local South Florida companies: Clean Earth Innovations, which will process organic waste through a rotary pyrolysis to create nutrient-rich biochar; and Fertile Earth Worm Farm, which deploys a composting solution to create high-quality, organic soil blends. The other winner is Scrapp, whose phone-based app educates and engages residents on proper waste disposal practices.

“As we advance our Zero Waste Master Plan, Miami-Dade is taking bold action to reduce landfill waste and build a more resilient Miami-Dade by pressure testing these solutions in real-world settings,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. “We’re running out of space in our landfills, and the time to act is now. Every innovative step we take helps protect our planet, reduce waste, and create a cleaner, more sustainable future for generations to come, which is why we’re positioning Miami-Dade County to lead in Zero Waste innovation while solving real problems for the residents we serve.""

Piloting the innovative technologies selected through the Public Innovation Challenge will inform and complement the County's Zero Waste Master Plan, a comprehensive roadmap that outlines a path forward to divert, reduce, and reuse overall waste in our community.

“Miami-Dade's new waste mandates require at least a 40% reduction in waste sent to landfills and such a substantial portion could be composted or reused,"" said Leigh-Ann Buchanan, President and CEO of MDIA. “Through the pilots of these winning solutions, we're demonstrating that innovation and technology can be at the forefront of optimizing efficiencies in waste diversion.”

MDIA’s Public Innovation Challenge sources, selects, funds, and facilitates pilots by early‑to growth‑stage companies to help solve high‑impact public problems. MDIA, in partnership with DSWM, selected the Public Innovation Challenge winners from a competitive pool of over 80 applicants, including local and global technology companies, after the challenge launched in March 2025. Each selected company will receive funding for $100,000 and the opportunity to test and validate their solutions with DSWM in a pilot setting.

""Our commitment to serve Miami-Dade residents means constantly improving how we manage waste and protect our environment,” said Miami-Dade County DSWM Director Aneisha Daniel, PhD. “By partnering with startups through this challenge, we’re exploring practical, sustainable solutions that serve our communities better and ensure a cleaner, healthier future for Miami-Dade County residents.""

As the County’s population continues to grow, waste diversion remains a critical strategy in mitigating environmental impact. By reducing the amount of waste being disposed of, communities can conserve natural resources, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, prevent soil and water contamination, and reduce the need to extract new resources for manufacturing. The four companies selected as winners of this Public Innovation Challenge will support these efforts and position Miami-Dade County as a leader in pursuing innovative approaches to its solid waste challenges.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among the notable Americans at COP30, bashed President Donald Trump for disregarding the event, which kicked off Monday.

“While Donald Trump skips the world stage, California is showing up — leading, partnering, and proving what American climate leadership looks like,” Newsom said on Tuesday.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, said in a press conference on Friday that the “Trump administration simply does not represent the American public on climate issues.”

Whitehouse, a ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, accused the current administration of representing the fossil fuel industry, “most particularly the big fossil fuel donors who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s political campaign.”

Why the U.S. did not send any delegates to COP30

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to COP30, according to the White House.

“The U.S. is not sending any high level representatives to COP30,” a White House official told ABC News ahead of the start of the conference. “The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships.”

Last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told The Associated Press that COP30 is “essentially a hoax.”

“It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told the AP, follow a two-day business conference in Athens.

Wright added that he may attend next year’s climate conference “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

The record-breaking U.S. federal government shutdown, which ended late Wednesday, also prevented federal lawmakers from attending the conference.

Who is at COP30?

Most of the nearly 200 countries that participate in the UNFCCC attend COP.

A total of 193 countries, plus the European Union, registered a delegation for the summit. Even North Korea sent a delegation to the climate summit, according to a Carbon Brief analysis.

The only other countries not in attendance are Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino, with each having displayed “sporadic” attendance at past conferences, according to Carbon Brief.

Other notable U.S. politicians who made the event include Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and former Vice President Al Gore.

Several mayors of American cities are also in attendance, including Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson.

American cities have always been at the forefront of innovation and climate action, said Gallego, chair of Climate Mayors and C40 Cities vice chair, in a statement.

“Mayors across the country are doubling down to fill the current void of leadership at the federal level,” Gallego said.

Other notable attendees from the U.S. at COP30 this year include Taryn Finnessey, managing director of the U.S. Climate Alliance.

Why experts say it’s important that the US participates in COP30

It is integral that the U.S., as one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to be present at every COP, environmental advocates told ABC News.

The U.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways, and therefore engagement by Americans signals to investors that the world’s largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes of the energy transition, Maria Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition, told ABC News.

“The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters,” Mendiluce said.

Being on the ground at COP is “essential” so delegations can engage with “full strength,” Max Frankel, director of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Institute, told ABC News.

In addition, the scope and urgency of the climate crisis demands an international response, Max Holmes, president and CEO of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News.

It is important to let other countries know that many Americans are still working to combat climate change, Lynda Hopkins, supervisor of California’s 5th district, County of Sonoma, told ABC News.

Although the White House isn’t in Belem to represent U.S. interest, Americans at COP30 are still working for solutions that are in the best interest of the country, Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told ABC News.

“While the Trump administration retreats, the people and companies here are seizing the opportunity to innovate, create jobs, and build safer, healthier futures,” Krupp said.

Although Hopkins said she and other American subnational delegates were “warmly received” by other countries, some prominent figures at COP30 indicated that the U.S. was not needed at the conference to accomplish goals.

Christiana Figueres, a diplomat from Costa Rica who played a key role in the inception of the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the U.S. would not be able to “do their direct bullying” due to the Trump administration’s boycott of the summit.

“I actually think it is a good thing,” Figueres said during a press conference on Tuesday.

Figueres then said, “Ciao, bambino,” which translates to “Bye, little boy,” in Italian, in response to Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time.

Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, described the Trump administration’s absence as “shortsighted decision” and a “slap in the face” to Americans who want clean air and water and lower energy costs.

“The reality is that this work will continue with or without America,” Frankel said.

COP30 is scheduled to run through Nov. 21.

Li Shuo, a veteran observer of China at U.N. climate talks who heads the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, countered that China's technology position was already a show of political leadership because its companies were making U.N. pledges achievable.","With the United States absent from the U.N. annual international climate summit for the first time in three decades, China is stepping into the limelight as a leader in the fight against global warming.

Its country pavilion dominates the entrance hall of the sprawling COP30 conference grounds in Brazil's Amazon city of Belem, executives from its biggest clean energy companies are presenting their visions for a green future to large audiences in English, and its diplomats are working behind the scenes to ensure constructive talks.

Those were Washington's roles, but they now reside with Beijing.

""Water flows to where there is space, and diplomacy often does the same,"" Francesco La Camera, director general at the International Renewable Energy Agency, told Reuters.

He said China's dominance in renewable energy and electric vehicles was bolstering its position in climate diplomacy.

China’s transformation from a quiet presence at the U.N.’s Conference of the Parties summits to a more central player seeking the world’s attention reflects a shift in the fight against global warming since U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to office.

Long a skeptic of climate change, Trump has again pulled the United States - the world's largest historic emitter - from the landmark international Paris Agreement to limit global warming. This year, for the first time ever, he declined to send an official high-level delegation to represent U.S. interests at the summit.

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters.

But critics warn the U.S. withdrawal from the process cedes valuable ground in the climate negotiations, particularly as China, currently the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, rapidly expands its renewable and EV industries.

""China gets it,"" said California Governor Gavin Newsom during a visit to the conference earlier this week. ""America is toast competitively, if we don't wake up to what the hell they're doing in this space, on supply chains, how they're dominating manufacturing, how they’re flooding the zone.""

Beautiful world

Unlike previous years, when China had a modest pavilion with just a handful of seats available for mostly technical and academic panels, its COP30 pavilion occupies prime space near the entrance next to host country Brazil.

Cups of sustainable Chinese single-origin coffee, panda toys and branded swag lure in passers-by who can watch presentations by Chinese officials and executives from the world's biggest renewable energy companies.

""Let's honor the legacy and fulfill the Paris guided by the vision of shared future,"" Meng Xiangfeng, vice president of China's CATL, the world's largest battery maker, told an audience on Thursday.

""Let's advance climate cooperation and build a clean, beautiful world together.""

The battery giant already supplies one-third of batteries for EV makers including Tesla TSLA.O, Ford F.N and Volkswagen VOWG.DE. It was CATL's first time hosting an event at a COP, seeking to reach an audience of governments and NGOs.

Earlier that afternoon, China's vice minister of ecology Li Gao told a packed audience that China's status as the world's leading producer of renewable energy ""brings benefits to countries, particularly in the Global South"".

China's State Grid, the world's largest electric utility, and solar giants Trina and Longi also made presentations.

Chinese electric auto giant BYD introduced a fleet of plug-in hybrid vehicles compatible with biofuel manufactured at its plant in Bahia, Brazil, for use at COP30.

Both COP President Andre Correa do Lago and COP30 CEO Ana de Toni have praised China's role as a clean energy technology leader.

""China has shown leadership not only by carrying out its own energy revolution, but with China's scale capacity, we can now also buy low-carbon... at competitive prices,"" de Toni told Reuters.

""China is very determined not only to continue to be a very stable leader in the Paris Agreement, strengthening climate governance, but also to take very practical actions to support other countries.""

Behind the scenes

China is playing a more subtle role behind the scenes in the negotiations by filling a void left by the United States, which was known for rallying governments toward agreement, according to current and former diplomats involved in negotiations.

""Little by little, China is acting as a guarantor of the climate regime,"" said one senior diplomat from an emerging economy. ""They invested a lot on the green economy. If there's any kind of involution, they will lose.""

One Brazilian diplomat said China played a key role in helping reach an agreement over the COP30 agenda before negotiations even began, whereas in previous years its diplomats would not get involved unless there was some key issue for them.

Sue Biniaz, who served as U.S. deputy climate envoy under John Kerry and was a key architect of the Paris Agreement, said China had the ability to bring together the wide-ranging interests of the developing world, from major emerging economies like the BRICS to small developing nations. She worked closely with Chinese counterparts on four bilateral climate agreements, including the one that unlocked the Paris deal.

""They tend to be very tough, take on tough positions like the U.S. did, but then be pragmatic towards the end,"" she told Reuters. ""They have to come up with an outcome that nobody thinks is bad enough to block.""

Biniaz said she was not yet convinced that China was playing a leadership role beyond the pavilions.

""If they had wanted to, they would have put in a more ambitious emission reduction target,"" she said, referring to China’s announcement in September that it would cut emissions at least 7% from their peak by 2035.

Li Shuo, a veteran observer of China at U.N. climate talks who heads the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, countered that China's technology position was already a show of political leadership because its companies were making U.N. pledges achievable.

We can argue about the precise extent but Shetland needs the energy transition.
The energy sector is still male-dominated and fixing that will take intervention.
There are now national plans for jobs in renewables and the energy transition.","It’s probably a sign of something when the oil and gas industry and the renewables sector are holding hands.

At the recent celebration of the 50th anniversary of Sullom Voe Oil Terminal being built, everyone involved emphasised how it had been an opportunity for employment, indeed careers for local people. Many of those who’ve benefited from those opportunities were in the audience.

EnQuest managing director Steve Bowyer and SIC convener Andrea Manson both highlighted the ever-nearing transition to clean energy as critical to continuing such opportunities.

While rightly focused on the community’s involvement throughout the history of the terminal, there was a recurring refrain of the oil industry welcoming the net zero future.

At the same time last week, the trade body Scottish Renewables, perhaps surprisingly, leapt to the support of oil and gas businesses, calling upon the chancellor to reform the windfall tax to protect investment in the North Sea.

The urgency of our climate breakdown has been highlighted at COP30 in Brazil this week, lending weight to the many voices calling for the government to stop licensing fossil fuel projects and start ending our crippling dependency on burning dinosaur remnants.

However, even the most vociferous Just Stop Oil campaigners admit that we’re at least going to have to wind down the existing infrastructure.

Without going as far as “drill-baby-drill”, renewable energy leaders wrote to support slowing the pace of decline in North Sea oil and gas while speeding up the deployment of renewables.

The common thread within both these items was jobs.

The risks of losing an existing skilled workforce; the challenges trying to find and fill new posts; and the opportunity to use the former to meet the latter. A just transition. But that might not be enough in Shetland. It’s hard to miss that local businesses are struggling to find staff.

There are serious challenges for important local services. It’s almost as if Shetland doesn’t have enough working people. We need more.

The numerous major energy projects reported (in these very pages) worry many but do represent an opportunity for new jobs that other regions already envy.

Quite reasonably the community is questioning the balance of costs and benefits. Of gains and losses. Of desirable economic activity or industrialisation.

We can sell how wonderful Shetland is for visitors but people need good jobs to actually live here.

We could cease all energy development, but when they start shuttering Sullom Voe Terminal then we might have bigger problems than the view. Grangemouth anyone?

We can argue about the precise extent but Shetland needs the energy transition.

We arguably don’t have a choice and need now to recognise the importance of planning ahead to have enough clean energy roles locally to give options for the declining oil and gas sector and to offer more of the types of skilled trades and professional positions that people and families living here can build lives around.

The thing that’s going to keep school-leavers living in, or returning to, Shetland is tangible pathways from entry level to skilled worker to supervisor to professional to advisor.

Once we have clear policy signals for what’s going to be developed around Shetland then that allows our local businesses and supply chain to invest in hiring for the future.

Apprenticeships will be the critical pathway. Plenty of local firms give, or want to give, chances to local youngsters. Plenty of local firms are also using temporary incoming workers. That’s fine too but it could be even better if we can get those workers to stay and bring their families here as well.

Back in the museum for the 50th anniversary event, sitting alongside locals who jumped at the chance to get jobs at Sullom Voe were many who came north for a project but ended up settling.

Another important way to address the skills gap will be by supporting women to join the workforce in different capacities.

The energy sector is still male-dominated and fixing that will take intervention.

Encouraging the uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects, providing funding for professional development training for women, and ensuring inclusive work environments will be required so more women gain the relevant skills for Shetland’s clean energy jobs.

In fairness, bodies such as Highlands and Islands Enterprise are undertaking considerable work to examine local capability and identify gaps where support for apprentices or women could help.

There are now national plans for jobs in renewables and the energy transition.

When co-ordinated, these together should help that local planning I mentioned.

Local businesses are vital to the challenge. Members of the Shetland Net Zero Energy Forum are particularly engaged but are not alone in giving attention to every stage of learning, including the earliest stages of skills support. From site visits to schools engagement to tertiary input for our sector.

The Careers Fair remains an annual highpoint for many.

As if last week didn’t have enough going on, my company supported the delivery of the second year of the reintroduced Shetland Science Fair for all of Shetland’s secondary one and two pupils plus many of the secondary threes.

Some 650 local pupils getting encouragement to develop the skills that could eventually lead to qualifications or trades that could then meet the jobs that Shetland desperately needs to remain sustainable.

If we get this right then 50 years from now there’ll be events in the museum discussing how Shetland transitioned from oil and gas to renewables and clean energies and how the community continued to take the opportunities created.

For years, President Trump has lamented the United States’ embrace of the renewable energy sector, with wind having a particular place in his apparent dislike for the industry. Now, industry leaders have pointed out that his administration’s cutbacks on wind power permits and cancellations of projects have effectively paralyzed the offshore wind industry in the United States. With the rest of the world embracing the renewable energy sector, the US stance is a far cry from the global adoption that the industry has seen.

Industry analysts point out that U.S. shipbuilders and port operators have been hit the hardest by Trump’s wind power policies

U.S. shipbuilders and port operators have seen serious damage to their profits and overall competitiveness due to the wave of project cancellations and stop-work orders that have been flowing out of the Trump administration since he took office for the second time.

The previous administration implemented policies to boost wind power in the United States, which has subsequently been essentially reversed by Trump. Stop-work orders, permit delays, and project cancellations have been the name of the game for Trump, as he aims to “drill, baby drill.” We suspect that what he meant by that is to bring back the reliance on coal and oil in the US and do away with the policies aimed at increasing federal assistance for the renewable energy sector.

Trump has publicly expressed his dislike for the wind sector on many occasions. The question is why

Trump calls offshore wind turbines “unsightly” and has, on several occasions, stated that the huge wind turbines are “making the whales a little bit batty”, whatever that means. Some have said that his disdain stems from a wind project in Scotland that spoils his view from his golf course as the main driver for his dislike for the sector, although there is no way of definitively proving that.

The impact of Trump’s policies has substantially affected the wind power sector

The US’s embrace of the renewable energy sector has hit a snag, with Trump’s policies affecting millions of dollars of profits for the shipbuilding sector, which relies heavily on contracts to transport workers and turbines to offshore projects.

The reported impacts include the more than $679 million worth of canceled Department of Transportation financing for ports that feed the offshore wind sector in the United States. This includes a $34 million grant for a facility in Salem, Massachusetts, which would have generated millions in tax revenue and created thousands of jobs for locals.

The Trump administration is not backing down, and claims the shipbuilding industry can be saved by them, of course

Mr Trump’s administration has stated that it can easily revive the US shipbuilding industry without the support of the offshore wind sector. One questions the reasoning and logic, as the wind sector has been proven to save billions in the long run, evidenced by the recent reports that the UK has saved billions over the past decade due to its embrace of the offshore wind sector.

The North Carolina Ports Authority asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to evaluate a proposal to deepen the Cape Fear River channel. The goal: to improve efficiency by better accommodating the larger Post-Panamax cargo ships that now dominate global trade.

According to USACE’s “Wilmington Harbor 403: Draft Environmental Impact Statement,” the project is intended to “contribute to national economic development by addressing transportation inefficiencies for the forecasted vessel fleet, consistent with protecting the Nation’s environment.” In 2020, Congress conditionally approved $834 million for the project, pending environmental review. A cost-sharing agreement between the USACE Wilmington District and the NC Ports Authority followed in 2022, and the “Wilmington Harbor 403 Draft Environmental Impact Statement” was released in September 2025.

Public comment was solicited multiple times on the proposal, with USACE scientists presenting a summary of their findings to the public on October 8, 2025. Although the draft includes three options: No Action (NAA), AA1 (dredging to 47 feet), and AA2 (dredging to 45 feet), only NAA and AA1 remain under consideration after the draft. USACE accepted written public comments until November 3, 2025.

Two Options Now Under Consideration

USACE is charged with choosing the option that Brett Walters, Chief of the Planning and Environmental Branch, explained, “best balances the costs, benefits, and adverse impacts.”

No Action Alternative (NAA) — maintain the current 42-foot channel with regular maintenance dredging.

Alternative Action 1 (AA1) — deepen the channel by 5 feet, plus 2 feet for error, to 47 feet and deepening to 49 feet from Battery Island into the ocean to reach deeper water. Widening the river channel in many areas and adding a channel prism (an angle to the sides) to reduce shoaling.

The project would relocate dredged material to several local beaches, marshes, islands, and eroding river shorelines. The plan also includes a mitigation plan to offset environmental impacts.

Since a thousand acres of freshwater wetlands are predicted to become brackish or salt marshes, the mitigation plan includes purchasing and protecting from development 500 acres of freshwater marsh around the Black River, a tributary that joins the Cape Fear River about 10 miles north of downtown Wilmington.

The mitigation plan also includes attempting to remove persistent invasive species from a different salt marsh to improve the habitat, and rerouting fish, like striped bass and endangered sturgeon, around and over dams they can't traverse when spawning. If approved, construction of AA1 would begin in 2030 and take six years, optimistically.

Potential Benefits of AA1

USACE says AA1 will give Post-Panamax ships more room to navigate and cause less erosion to riverbanks because there will be more ship clearance. According to USACE Oceanographer Dr. Grace Maze, deeper water would reduce stress on the riverbed by giving ships more clearance between their hulls and the channel bottom.

Shipping companies would also save money. Currently, larger cargo ships must “light load” to navigate the Cape Fear, meaning they carry less cargo and make more trips. They must also time their arrivals and departures with high tide, which creates inefficiency and increased cost. If ships could enter fully loaded, the Corp states that fewer trips will be needed. According to the Draft Report, the average annual net benefit would be $15,874,000, producing a cost-to-benefit ratio of 1.3.

“This is not fantastic,” said geologist Roger Shew, a retired UNCW professor, “but it meets the criteria” for the government to remain interested in the project.

USACE states the plan is unlikely to harm regional drinking water. Clarissa Murray, P.E., lead civil engineer in hydraulics, notes that water wells in Carolina Beach, Kure, and Bald Head Island should not experience saltwater intrusion from the project. In addition, David Connelly, also with USACE, adds that in Wilmington, impacts to salinity at the supply wells are small and unlikely to be noted.

Because of the loss of freshwater wetlands and impacts to aquatic habitat, mandated mitigation in the project includes improved fish passage around Lock and Dam 1, LD1 (near Reigelwood), and a rock arch rapid at Lock and Dam 2, LD2 (near Elizabethtown), potentially helping some fish reach their spawning grounds. In addition, purchasing about 500 acres of freshwater marsh near the Black River will protect it from development.

Roughly half of the dredged materials are earmarked for beneficial use, including rebuilding eroded beaches, marsh areas, and shorelines, areas on the Cape Fear River, and the Wilmington Offshore Fisheries Structure.

“The rocks will provide important reef habitats in the offshore environment,” explained Shew.

Environmental Concerns

Critics of the AA1 plan warn that the ecological costs could outweigh the economic benefits. Endangered species such as green sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon could be harmed by both the deepening process and its long-term effects. Increased water particles and rock blasting vibrations may greatly impact sturgeon. Blasting impacts might be minimized with proper procedures, noted Shew.

Below: Adapted from the draft report. This table shows the animals in the area, whether or not they might be affected by the project, and how likely the effect might be.

Other species, like oysters, southern flounder, spot, and striped bass, will be negatively affected by the project. Wildlife, including turtles, can be trapped and killed in the machinery, and moving sediment to beaches could interfere with turtles during nesting and hatching. Shew pointed out that removing sediment will likely impact creatures living on and in the riverbed, like crabs.

The NC Audubon Society expressed concern in an online statement about “heavier ships and larger wakes into the river, which erode nesting islands, increasing overwash of nests, and will destroy over 1,000 acres of wetlands that support bottomland forest birds, fisheries, [and] water quality.”

Other scientists warn of subtle but lasting physical changes to the river system. USACE’s Dr. Maze noted that tidal range and storm surge would increase only slightly—about 0.11 feet at high tide. Even minor changes can compound with sea-level rise.

Shew explained that Wilmington is “having one of the larger rises in sea level on the East Coast since 2000 and is a compound flood area... This will have even more impact in the future…Even with no sea level rise, a 500-year storm event, a surge in a deepened river would increase peak water levels by 3.1% at Wilmington and expand the total inundation area by 0.5% compared to taking no action.”

Erosion and bed stress would also continue.

“Regardless of the action, increased vessel traffic over time would continue to elevate sediment disturbance and shoreline vulnerability through Wilmington Harbor,” said Maze.

Cargo volumes will continue to increase and, “the vessel fleet serving the US East Coast is expected to continue to shift to larger vessels in the future,” said David Connelly, Chief of Public Affairs for USACE.

Maintenance dredging would not end either—in fact, it could accelerate. Maze explained that deepening has historically increased the rate by 6 to 34% in some places without sea level change. The channel becomes shallow again from sediment accumulation, requiring more frequent dredging and associated costs. Maze adds that as sea levels rise, the rate will increase further.

Climate change may compound these risks.

“We have seen the impact of 500 and even 1000-year flood events caused by heavier rainfall,” Shew wrote in a summary he shared with the public. “When coupled with the higher tides, storm surge, and sea level rise, our area businesses and property are even more at risk.”

Saltwater intrusion is another growing concern. Deepening the channel allows denser saltwater to move farther upstream, converting freshwater wetlands to brackish and killing centuries-old trees.

“Saltier water damages freshwater plants and also causes the breakdown of freshwater organics/mud in the soils,” Shew explained. “This breakdown will lead to even more erosion and subsidence in the adjacent land areas dominated by the freshwater tidal wetlands.”

A recent UNC Wilmington study found that some trees near the danger zone are over 400 years old, with one dated to at least 800 years. This study also shows a tie between saltwater intrusion and the increase in the size of the ghost forest. Shew shared Google Earth photos taken roughly twenty years apart in the same season, and the evidence of the expansion of the ghost forest is clear. Although the mitigation plan includes protecting some existing freshwater wetlands, it does not restore those that will be lost.

Below: Images shared by Shew, showing the conversion of the Town Creek area from forest to marsh. The change is attributed to soil and salinity changes, resulting from storms and a 2005 dredging project that deepened the Cape Fear from 38 to 42 feet.

The plan includes fish-passage improvements, but the LD2 rock ramp may not be effective, especially for the cost of $32 million.

“A rock ramp was built at LD1 [in 2012 and modified in 2021] as mitigation for previous harbor modifications, but successful passage of Atlantic Sturgeon via the rock ramp has not yet been documented,” according to the draft report. Shew suggested that instead of building another rock ramp at LD2, the funds could be used to remove or partially remove the dam since it isn’t used for storage, allowing fish to use this part of the river naturally. “This would promote upstream migration and provide funds for rock arch rapid construction at LD3, which would possibly allow full passage up the Cape Fear,” Shew explained.

Another issue not yet addressed in the draft report is PFAS contaminated river sediments. Shew pointed out that PFAS information is not addressed since it’s not currently regulated by the EPA. However, it will be regulated in 2031—only one year into this project. Several studies have shown PFAS is present in Cape Fear River sediments. PFAS are dangerous chemicals that can lead to myriad health problems, e.g., cancer, birth defects, thyroid disease, lowered response to vaccination. According to a 2024 study, PFAS can be absorbed through the skin.

“Knowing the level of contaminants in the sediment before dredging is important to determine possible human/wildlife impacts,” said Shew.

No Action Alternative

Choosing NAA would avoid new environmental disturbances, but it wouldn’t eliminate maintenance dredging, which would continue to place materials on Brunswick County beaches and Eagles Island. Larger ships would still need to light-load and rely on high tides, increasing inefficiency and cost. Dr. Maze noted that NAA could actually increase erosion and bed stress by 20% compared to the deepening proposal given the higher number of vessels required.

Conclusions

Critics note that if the AA1 plan is followed, it will bring environmental harm without delivering significant economic benefits. It will increase the loss of trees, salt marsh vegetation, and wildlife, threaten endangered turtles and sturgeon, and increase flooding.

Although the USACE public comment period has closed, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is now accepting public input on the project. A public hearing will be held on November 17, 2025, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the Skyline Center.

It demonstrated that a just transition is possible and that social dialogue with trade unions must be the first step” Riera said.
A just transition for renewables: Why COP30 must put people before power Lessons learned: from energy to social transition But the experience has also exposed key limits.
The next phase for just transition UGT is now working with its federations to shape Spain’s next Just Transition Strategy (2026–2030).
“This is not only about jobs,” Riera said.","Unions in Spain are calling for a new just transition strategy that goes beyond plant closures to revive the fabric of life in affected regions, linking public services with jobs and investment.

“When a power plant closes in a rural area, you don’t just lose jobs,” said Manuel Riera of UGT, one of Spain’s largest unions. “You risk losing the life of the place – the families, the neighbours, the school, the bus line. To keep people rooted, we have to rebuild whole economies.”

The end goal is to safeguard workers, diversify rural economies, and keep families rooted.

Spain’s breakthrough: dialogue and territorial pacts

Spain is among the few countries to have managed coal closures through negotiated territorial pacts. Since 2018, 15 agreements have been signed between national, regional and local governments in areas hit by mine and power plant shutdowns. The government also reached tripartite accords with unions and coal companies, guaranteeing solutions for affected workers.

“For the first time, workers and their communities had a seat at the table. It demonstrated that a just transition is possible and that social dialogue with trade unions must be the first step” Riera said. “That gave people dignity in a moment of loss.”

These frameworks funded retraining, supported job-creating projects and ensured public participation. They became an international reference for how social dialogue can guide decarbonisation.

A just transition for renewables: Why COP30 must put people before power

Lessons learned: from energy to social transition

But the experience has also exposed key limits. Job creation alone has not been enough to sustain rural life.

“Again and again we heard: in addition to employment, what decides if families stay is whether there is transport, housing, health care, education,” Riera said. “That is what keeps a territory alive. We have to move from an energy transition to a social transition.”

Judit Carreras Garcia, director of the Instituto para la Transición Justa (ITJ), reflected on the government’s efforts to respond to these challenges:

“Over the years, we have sought to make the just transition a reality through concrete policies and actions — walking the talk through a wide range of measures that include employability schemes, training, funding lines for job-creating business initiatives, just transition energy tender grids, municipal support programmes and environmental restoration,” she explained.

“All of them aim at minimising the impacts of decarbonisation and optimising outcomes based on participation and social dialogue. This effort has come with its own challenges — from managing timing gaps to addressing very different territorial starting points — but our commitment remains firm.”

Both unions and government acknowledge that anticipation is crucial: closures must be aligned with new opportunities, and support must adapt to vastly different territorial realities – from regions facing depopulation to those with stronger infrastructure.

The next phase for just transition

UGT is now working with its federations to shape Spain’s next Just Transition Strategy (2026–2030). Visits to pact areas, including Aragón, where a coal plant closed in 2020, reveal a rising sense of frustration.

“People are tired of waiting,” Riera said. “We have projects on paper, but they don’t see them materialising. Without effective coherent planning, workers retrain and then have to move to Madrid or Barcelona. That is not territorial justice.”

The unions’ demand: keep the territorial approach, but expand it across ministries and sectors, ensuring that services and infrastructure grow alongside jobs.

For Indian women workers, a just transition means surviving climate impacts with dignity

Behind the technical debates lies a deeper fear: the hollowing out of rural Spain, where thousands of villages have already lost their young people and their future. A mishandled transition could accelerate that trend.

“This is not only about jobs,” Riera said. “It is about whether towns survive at all. When a power station shuts, it’s not just the jobs inside the gates that disappear. The bus stops running, the school risks closing, the clinic can’t keep going, housing starts to deteriorate. Families leave, and a town empties. And once they leave, they rarely come back.”

Sharing lessons internationally

In September, Riera met unions from around the world to share Spain’s experience. His message was simple: we must fight for social dialogue and territorial agreements, but these are the beginning — not the end — of a just transition.

“If decisions are only made in the capital, they miss what life is like in a village. What Madrid sees as energy policy, a small town sees as survival: will there still be a bus, a clinic, a school? That is why workers and communities must always be in the room.”

For Riera, the work that goes into the just transition is also a chance to imagine something new.

“We can use this moment not just to protect people from loss, but to renew rural life — to make villages places where families want to stay, where children can imagine their future. This is about dignity, but also about love: love of place, love of community, love of life itself.”

“Water is worth more than lithium,” Indigenous Argentine community tells COP30

A call for Belém – and beyond

Now in Belém for COP30, Riera is bringing a clear message to world leaders: Spain’s experience shows that the just transition must be built from the ground up. The Belém Action Mechanism that has been proposed, he argues, should require cross-sector transition plans – not just energy policies; guarantee participation from workers and communities; and secure public finance capable of delivering not only jobs but the services that sustain life around them.

“The Global South faces the same challenge: how to transition without abandoning people. Without public finance, that is impossible,” he said. “If we treat the just transition as a bargaining chip, we betray them. But if we take it seriously, we can create hope — from Spain to Brazil, from Santander to Belém.”

“This is not only about closing coal or opening renewables,” he added. “It is about whether people can imagine a future for their children. That is what the just transition means.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/Pic-Andorra-2.png,N,,2025-11-15 11:04:25.026161

Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,” said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you’re trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn’t make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

“And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people’s behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. “Most people don’t even realize they’re there.”

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they’re protesting or backing. If you like what they’re doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn’t much you can do about it. “I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,” he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

While energy may account for just 7% of America’s GDP, former FERC Chair Mark Christie claims, “it’s the foundational seven percent, everything else in our economy and lifestyle flows from it.”

Between grid overload and extreme weather, sudden power outages cost the U.S. economy an estimated $150 billion per year. The 2021 Texas freeze alone inflicted $130 billion in losses from property damage, lost business, and cascading supply chain disruptions.

We face a simple reality: Our 20th-century grid wasn’t built to support a 21st-century economy. We need leaders who will step up and demand that we upgrade U.S. grid infrastructure—because without a modern, robust grid, our economy, national security, and global standing are at serious risk.

DEMAND IS SURGING AND THE GRID’S NOT READY

According to the latest forecasts, electricity demand is expected to rise sharply over the next few decades, increasing by over three-quarters (78%) by 2050. Electrification and AI have already begun to blindside grid planners. Major utilities report load forecasts five times higher than in 2023, driven by the opening of hyperscale data centers across states like Virginia and Texas.

We can’t afford complacency while demand grows, extreme conditions escalate, and our rivals invest in modernization. While our legacy infrastructure works today, we’re vulnerable to foreign supply chains, and our system is strained by transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and a shortage of skilled workers. We’re struggling to deliver power The gap between what our industries require and what the grid can deliver is growing.

We need to change direction, collectively. But change doesn’t happen without a catalyst. Business leaders often think their technology will create its own demand. But there needs to be a catalyst for change. I would argue that these converging pressures are creating a catalyst like we’ve never seen before. True leadership requires seeing around corners and investing in solutions today.

HOW WE GET THERE

The energy revolution we need goes beyond adding more wind turbines and solar batteries. It demands a complete reorg of grid architecture, technology, and management. We need to move from analog to digital thinking. A digital, AI-enabled grid can slash technical losses, enable real-time balancing of supply and demand, and support clean power at scale. New and refreshed technologies, such as grid-enhancing technology (GETs), fusion, and advanced nuclear, need to be part of the solution.

But modernization is complex. Without a collaborative, stable foundation built through public-private partnerships, investments in new technology, grid permitting reform, and strengthening our U.S. workforce, manufacturing, and supply chains, we will never get there.

LEAD BEFORE THE NEED

Across the U.S., nearly 75% of the country’s 35 leading utility companies have reported data centers are demanding more electricity, a demand that will continue to climb. Industry leaders need to make big moves and take bold bets. Investments in grid resilience show a high ROI. A $1 investment in preparedness can yield up to $6 in savings by reducing lost economic activity and recovery costs.

Visionary leaders are already partnering across sectors to reduce constraints to modernization and strengthen our talent pipeline. Microsoft and Google are taking on risk and working with utilities and start-ups to pave the way for innovative energy projects, with companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Antora, and Helion, building domestic solutions, supply chains, and workforce capacity well before full-scale commercial fusion, thermal storage, or grid-scale batteries are the norm.

BUILD RESILIENCE: POLICY, PEOPLE, AND PARTNERSHIPS

Policy is moving in the right direction. A recent White House Executive Order directs the use of all available power generation and decisive steps to prevent grid failures. The CIRCUIT Act and One Big Beautiful Bill Act—along with initiatives like the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act, Advancing GETS Act, and Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act—also support U.S. manufacturing and supply chain expansion. Meanwhile, the DOE’s Speed to Power and workforce innovation programs respond to grid operators’ calls for faster permitting and a new generation of technical talent.

But policy alone won’t solve this problem. We need utility leaders, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), investors, and technology innovators to shoulder the risk, share best practices, and push for scalable market solutions.

Leaders should take the following steps to prepare:

Build U.S.-based supply chains. Source advanced energy components like high-performance capacitors, solid-state transformers, and power electronics through American suppliers to protect against global disruptions, reduce long-term costs, and build a strategic edge.

Invest in workforce development. Train future scientists, engineers, and skilled tradespeople through training programs, partnerships, and upskilling. Growing talent now ensures readiness as grid needs evolve.

Partner early, act urgently. Rather than waiting for new mandates or market saturation, engage utilities, policymakers, technology innovators, investors now to test, scale, and set standards ahead of rising demand, position your organization as a decisive leader.

A TEST OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP

America cannot afford to sit on its heels. Those who invest in the workforce, scale robust supply chains, and co-create with customers will shape our energy future, paving the way for a modern digital grid, commercial fusion, and beyond.

Business and government leaders must act today to strengthen America’s national security and global competitiveness. If we settle for anything less, we risk America’s future as an economic powerhouse and innovation leader. The world’s strongest economy demands the world’s best grid.

“The (Electric Vehicle Transition) bill in the Senate shows that our society is responsible.
Also, his company, Cedric Masters Group assembles JIM-ISUZU, a brand of electric vehicles in Lagos.
He also lauded the promoter of the bill, Senator Kalu, particularly for the potential help the law would be for investors in the EV sector.
Chief Chukwuma said the proposed bill is part of President Bola Tinubu’s green mobility strategy which seeks to promote the use of Compressed Natural Gas and electric vehicles.","The Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill, 2025, has been lauded by some automotive sector chieftains since it came up for second reading on Wednesday, November 5th, 2025.

The proposed legislation, introduced by Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, the Senator representing Abia North, seeks to establish a national framework for the transition to electric vehicles, encourage local manufacturing, and strengthen Nigeria’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

When the proposed legislation had its second reading, lawmakers overwhelmingly supported it, describing it as a necessary step to diversify the economy and align with global clean energy trends.

Senator Kalu had informed the senate that the legislation aims to transform Nigeria’s automotive and energy sectors, foster innovation, and create jobs throughout the manufacturing value chain.

Key highlights of the bill include: tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, and subsidies for electric vehicle users and investors; and making it mandatory for all fuel stations to install charging points

The bill further requires foreign automakers seeking to sell electric vehicles in Nigeria to partner with licensed local assemblers and establish domestic assembly plants within three years.

It also aims to compel companies to source at least 30 percent of their components locally by 2030, while violations could attract fines of up to N250 million per breach, even as unlicensed importers risk penalties of N500 million and confiscation of goods.

The legislation, which is expected to position Nigeria as a potential hub for electric vehicles production in Africa, would incentivise investors who establish charging infrastructure by availing them with government grants and tax credits.

These automotive industry chieftains believe the proposed law is capable of improving the domestic automotive industry, particularly if it is assiduously implemented.

Commenting on the fine points of the proposed law, the Director General of the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Joseph Osanipin said, “We at the NADDC have said it time and time again, that the future of mobility is in electric vehicles, and it is commendable when your legislators see it the way it is.

“And they have also shown that they are aware that we in Nigeria don’t have to sit back and allow the whole world to move far away and leave us behind, only for us to complain later.

“It will not be good to do nothing now and start complaining later. It is always good that whenever we want to take action, we don’t take action based on policy alone, but also back whatever we are doing with law.

“The (Electric Vehicle Transition) bill in the Senate shows that our society is responsible. It shows that our government is responsible. It shows that all of us are responsible, and it is also good to note that the sponsor of this bill, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, is a member of the Senate committee on Industry that has oversight on NADDC, and he understands the issues involved.“The Senate Committee on Industry is one of the committees where you have many legislators who have held the executive position in their various states. So, Senator Orji Kalu understands what it takes to grow this industry.”

Osanipin said though he had not seen the details of the bill, it was clear to him from what he had read so far that it is all about the development of the auto industry, and about “putting in place the necessary infrastructures, and the necessary support that are going to drive this industry.”

He said many countries have set target dates to end the production and sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles in their efforts to fully transition to electric vehicles and reduce carbon emissions.

“In some countries like China, for example, they have already set a target to stop the manufacture and use of petrol and diesel vehicles, and before that deadline, their people are free to register their vehicles just the way you do your licence every year here.

“But, after that time which I think is in the next eight years or so, you cannot get a licence for your vehicle again if the vehicle is not EV.”

“With various developed economies, including European countries, setting targets of between 2030 and 2040 to completely phase out the manufacture and use of fossil-fuel vehicles.

“We are pushing to get to a point that by 2035, the adoption rate of electric vehicles (in Nigeria) will be much higher,” Osanipin said.

He said, “We also have to develop and prepare, because if we are not looking at taking action today, those vehicles they can no longer register in China and other countries, what do you think will happen to them? Your guess is as good as mine.”

NADDC, he said, would be willing to give any kind of support needed to ensure the bill is passed into law and vigorously implemented. “We are ready to honour their invitation, if they call us to give support. If they need any questions, if they need any information, we are always available. We are happy that our legislature is taking this to the next level.

“It is always good when you have people that are ready to give you legislative backing. We are ready to work with the National Assembly. If they call us for a presentation, we’ll be there. We are ready to work with them.”

The National Coordinator, Automotive Local Content Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (ALCMAN), Chief Anselm Ilekuba, described the proposed law as a welcome development, considering their efforts to manufacture auto parts for vehicle production in the country and to drive the domestic auto industry towards developing the electric vehicle technology.

Also, his company, Cedric Masters Group assembles JIM-ISUZU, a brand of electric vehicles in Lagos.

He also lauded the promoter of the bill, Senator Kalu, particularly for the potential help the law would be for investors in the EV sector.

He presented his EV lineup, stating that “Apart from the rugged 2.4 litre JIM ISUZU Re-Max 4×4 pick-up which has already started making a mark in the market as a reliable work horse, Cedric Masters is also ushering into the Nigerian market the Leapmotor brand known for its affordable and tech-focused new energy vehicles (NEVs).”

He said the company is also introducing into the local market the Voyah brand of luxury electric vehicles. “Our subsidiary, Cedric Clean Energy Solution, which has an electric charge station assembly plant in Lekki, Lagos State, sees this as a wonderful development and calls for greater stakeholder involvement, especially with NADDC and ALCMAN.

“I commend Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for this laudable bill which shows vision and will serve as a cursor to the long-awaited Nigerian Automotive Industry Development Programme.”

The Chairman, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company Ltd (IVM), Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, CON, said the eventual outcome of the bill would tie in with some of the aims of the Nigerian Auto Policy (Nigerian Automotive Industry Development Programme, NAIDP).

Chief Chukwuma, who is building a completely new multibillion naira auto plant in Nnewi, which was conceived to manufacture only EVs and other vehicles that run on Compressed Natural Gas, suggested that the bill should be made to also accommodate the deepening of CNG utilisation.

He said Nigeria has abundant gas, adding that users of CNG-powered vehicles enjoy tremendous advantages, including cheaper cost per kilometre, and considerably low maintenance expenses.

Chief Chukwuma said the proposed bill is part of President Bola Tinubu’s green mobility strategy which seeks to promote the use of Compressed Natural Gas and electric vehicles.",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/pick-up-4-online.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 13:01:09.907049

Energy Transfer has let investors down before And Energy Transfer's distribution cut in 2020 wasn't the only time it made a troubling call.","Most investors examining Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) today are likely excited by the approximately 8% distribution yield of the master limited partnership (MLP). That's a lot of income if you are trying to live off dividends in retirement.

Just don't get so enamored of the yield that you overlook the full story. Here's why Energy Transfer may not be the stock to set you up for a lifetime of reliable income -- but one of its industry peers could be.

What does Energy Transfer do?

Energy Transfer operates in a sector known for its high volatility. Oil and natural gas prices can fluctuate dramatically and rapidly in response to factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical conflicts, and the economy.

Except that the energy sector isn't one monolithic business. It is actually broken down into three segments.

Energy producers operate in what is known as the upstream segment. Companies that use the upstream output to produce chemicals and refined products, such as gasoline, operate in the downstream segment. Both of these are commodity-driven businesses, with the downstream facing commodity volatility on both the input and output sides of the business.

Energy Transfer operates in what is known as the midstream; this segment connects the upstream to the downstream and the rest of the world. Energy Transfer collects fees for the use of the energy infrastructure it owns, such as pipelines.

Demand for energy is more important than the price of the commodities flowing through its system. Given the importance of oil and natural gas to the world's economy, volumes tend to remain fairly robust even during economic downturns, such as recessions.

From this perspective, Energy Transfer's business is attractive. It gets even more attractive when you see that the MLP produced cash flow that covered its distribution by 1.8 times through the first nine months of 2025. That's strong support for the distribution and gives investors a good reason to believe that Energy Transfer could set them up with a lifetime of reliable income.

Energy Transfer isn't the only midstream giant

Energy Transfer's business isn't unique; there are other midstream businesses that are just as well-positioned. For example, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) has a nearly 7% distribution yield and an investment-grade balance sheet, and its distribution is also well covered. Despite the similarities, though, don't just assume the higher yield is the better choice.

The distributions paid by Energy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners are approved by each one's board of directors, just like at any other company. Enterprise has increased its distribution annually for 27 consecutive years. Energy Transfer's distribution has increased for four years, if you include 2025, which isn't over yet. Its distribution was cut in half in 2020 so the MLP could focus on strengthening its finances.

When the coronavirus pandemic was raging in 2020, there was a huge amount of uncertainty, including in the energy sector. So it isn't unreasonable that Energy Transfer cut its distribution. But that cut came right when most investors would probably have been hoping for continuity.

Enterprise, by contrast, stuck by its distribution through that difficult period and many that came before it, too. If you are a conservative dividend investor, sacrificing a little yield here might be a good strategy.

Energy Transfer has let investors down before

And Energy Transfer's distribution cut in 2020 wasn't the only time it made a troubling call. In 2016, the company inked a deal to acquire the Williams Companies but then backed out of it because its industry was in a rough state.

The effort to scuttle the deal included issuing convertible securities, a significant portion of which went to the CEO at the time. Those convertible securities would likely have protected the holders from the impact of a dividend cut, which Energy Transfer warned was a possibility if the Williams deal went through.

That deal was called off, so no material harm was done, and the dividend was not cut. However, the 2020 distribution cut, combined with the 2016 situation with Williams, should likely leave investors with trust issues.

There are no similar trust issues with Enterprise Products Partners. That's why Enterprise is probably a better option for conservative investors seeking to set themselves up with a lifetime of reliable income.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2025-11-15 13:02:16.000263

Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents.
City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Hundreds of global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,"" said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you're trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn't make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

""And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people's behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. ""Most people don’t even realize they’re there.""

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they're protesting or backing. If you like what they're doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn't much you can do about it. ""I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,"" he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

Forterra Developers plans to build duplexes and townhomes on a 50-acre lot right off State Highway 29 West in Georgetown.

In most cases, a developer would go through several meetings with city council and the public to approve such a development. In this case, the developer does not have to go through that many hurdles because they deannexed the land from Georgetown’s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ).

The ability to do that became possible through a law passed during the 2023 Texas legislative session. Senate Bill 2038, authored by Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, allows residents and property owners in an ETJ to apply for removal from the ETJ.

Since that law passed, the City of Georgetown said they have had:

105 disannexation requests

91 accepted disannexation requests that met all needed requirements

3,965 acres total disannexed

“What it creates is what we call the Swiss cheese effect, where you’ll have a parcel that is completely surrounded by the City of Georgetown—that is not in the City of Georgetown,” said Josh Schroeder, the Mayor of Georgetown.

Or we’re providing trash service all around an area, but not within that area,” Schroeder said. “Or we’re providing wastewater service all around an area, but not within that area—and that little donut hole of an area may have their own wastewater plant.”

Community members who live close to where the wastewater treatment plant would be built voice concerns over its possible effects to the environment.

“We are sitting right in the middle of the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone—so a really sensitive area,” said Rebecca Burnett, who lives nearby.

“We really fear what will happen with the water quality and the pollution because bad things happen, mistakes happen,” said Danette Ray, who also lives nearby.

Satish Babu Chakka is the CEO of Forterra Developers, and he says the reason why they deannexed is because it was too expensive to build infrastructure to connect Georgetown’s wastewater system due to the location of the development.

“You would have to spend about $40 million or $50 million to bring that infrastructure—and we are the small developers, building only 350 units,” Chakka said. “That’s humongous cost.”

Chakka said that they are following the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s (TCEQ) guidelines to build the water treatment plant.

“We are following those guidelines at the end of the day, and we want to be a good neighbor,” Chakka said.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-202451.png?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 13:01:46.730484

The fist-pumping billionaire is buzzing, testing the limits of his safety line.

Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest, the minted miner turned renewable energy zealot, has made a life pushing the boundaries.

He's been up the turbine longer than expected, and behind calm faces, his minders make mental tweaks to the day's schedule.

After a socially intense morning of handshaking, backslapping and small talk, the bloke is probably happy to have a moment to himself. Alone at the top.

Hours earlier, Forrest jetted in from overseas and choppered up to cut the ribbon at Clarke Creek, the biggest wind farm opened in Australia this year.

It's something of an achievement given the growing political and community resistance slowing down the rollout of big renewable projects.

""I'd just love it if every Australian could get up here — it's just the most beautiful feeling in the world,"" Forrest says after finally descending and de-harnessing.

It is the middle of a heatwave, and a hot wind has started whistling through the blades of the nearly 100 wind turbines dotted along the Broadsound Range, between Rockhampton and Mackay.

""It's just this strong, gentle breeze — the beautiful state of Queensland rolling out over these incredibly gracious wind towers,"" Forrest says, like he's been meditating up there.

""It's just slowly evolving, and you know that they're doing so much good every time they turn … it's an emotional feeling.""

You can almost picture Forrest on his private jet, unwrapping his new high-vis Squadron Energy shirt, ""Andrew"" embroidered on the chest.

The work boots he wears are fresh out of the box, too. The worn-in kit is probably still at the back door of the homestead at the family's Minderoo Station, in Western Australia.

""I grew up with the mentorship of two old stockmen — one was Indigenous, one was white,"" Forrest says.

""They both really stressed … you've got to do your best in life, you have to be as useful as you can.""

As a boy on the cattle station, Forrest was given the Aboriginal name Nyidinghu, meaning youngest in the family, and offered some simple advice:

""Don't not enjoy it, mate,"" he recalls his mentors telling him.

“I think the younger Nyidie … would think, 'Yeah, alright mate, now have a proper crack.'""

While Forrest may have been tight with the local mob on Minderoo, having a crack has created serious tensions with the traditional owners of land he's since made billions from.

The legal battle between Fortescue Metals Group and the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation has been going for years, with a landmark federal court decision looming on a $1.8 billion damages claim.

Forrest will deal with that when he has to — today, there's a performance to deliver.

In front of a press pack, he could have been holding court at a stock camp.

Fending off attempts to draw out a headline-worthy political punch, he praises the media for ""barbecuing"" the climate change-denying Donald Trump.

Mining billionaires and the conservative side of politics are often seen as a natural fit, but Twiggy has short shrift for the Coalition decision to ditch a net zero target, in fact he wants to go much further.

""There's an excrement which my cattle put out regularly which I'd call net zero,"" he says.

""Net [zero] allows for a whole heap of fakery, for a whole heap of ducking and dodging and spinning yarns just to make a quid or two.""

Instead of relying on offsets to reduce carbon emissions, Forrest is ploughing ahead with a plan to make his iron ore operations ""real zero"" — electrifying his fleet of machinery, ramping up renewable energy input and battery storage, and, despite the setbacks, building his own hydrogen-fuelled green steel operation.

On a national level, the massive Clarke Creek Wind Farm, set to include battery storage, solar and another 88 turbines by the time it's complete, will also be a key contributor to Australia's goal of reaching 82 per cent renewable energy generation by 2030.

But the transition is getting harder. There is growing pushback from political opponents and some rural community groups, who are understandably stunned at the scale of the industrialisation of once-quiet country areas.

Since the change of government at last year's Queensland election, there has been a notable decline in enthusiasm for the renewables transition.

Coal-fired power stations have had their lifetimes extended, while legislated targets for renewable energy have been dumped, with several projects put on ice.

Just a few years ago, Forrest was standing over a shovel at a world-leading hydrogen electrolyser plant in Gladstone, preaching about how the technology would transform the energy industry.

Today, that project has been scrapped, with the state government looking to recoup the $65 million in taxpayer funds already invested.

Presumably, this was just part of Forrest ""having a proper crack"". He accepts there are ""hard roads ahead"" for hydrogen, but failure only seems to fire the man.

""Success isn't a formula, it's being prepared to tolerate failure time and time again,"" Forrest says.

""The fast track to success is failing your way — failing your way to success, failing the way to the top.""

The bottom of the hill

Forrest's wind farm is just one of many renewable projects under construction on the Broadsound Range.

Last year, investment in the renewable energy sector hit a historic $12.7 billion. The main problem now is finding the people to build it.

Most of the workforce executing the visions of mega investors like Forrest are new to town, living on site in demountable camp accommodation.

Among them is Bull, who's part of a construction team working on a nearby solar farm.

""There's a lot of big projects about to start that support renewables, but getting them across the line and keeping people employed seems to be hard at the minute,"" Bull says.

""I've seen a lot of lack of coordination — they all seem to start at the same time, and then there's always a lack of manpower.""

But there's plenty of work if you want it.

When there's downtime, Bull and his workmates enjoy returning to real life. As the sun sets, they join truckies and tourists taking a break overnight at the makeshift campground behind the Marlborough Hotel.

""It's demanding at times, but it's nothing we're not used to — hot, windy,"" Bull says.

""We come to get away from the camp just for our own personal time.""

Despite some of the hostile signage and political corflutes in the region, he reckons the workforce at least is largely welcome.

""It's keeping a lot of people employed through a stagnant civil construction industry at the minute, because I know where I live, it's a little bit quiet,"" Bull says.

""Generally, the blokes on the projects have a great relationship with the locals … the political side of it is more in the development approvals.

The township of Marlborough is a quiet, peaceful place — aside from the odd train that roars through.

For Sue Bruce, the owner of Grandma's Groceries and Cafe, it has been home for two decades.

""We're cattle-raising country, but with old-fashioned country values,"" she says.

Between wrangling rowdy kids after school and haggling over the price of a slurpy depending on available cash, Sue is a sounding board for locals.

""We look after each other … look after your mates, we still bring a plate to functions,"" she says.

Between Grandma's and the pub next door, this is the main supply point and beer-drinking destination for the workforce at the surrounding solar and wind farms.

""It brings in a huge volume of itinerant workers … which brings extra camps … puts pressure on the already existing services of a small community,"" Sue says.

She's not against the renewables industry taking over parts of the area — from all accounts, she's been able to squeeze money out of companies like Forrest's Squadron Energy to help support community events.

But there is the perennial problem all regional towns around Australia rank as number one: the bloody roads.

""The roads are crumbling,"" Sue says.

""Roads are our biggest concern because the trucks are going over that old highway that was never built to sustain those weights.""

Marlborough sits just off the Bruce Highway, between Rockhampton and Mackay, at the nexus of three council areas. It's in the Livingstone Shire, which has far fewer ratepayers than the big cities to the north and south — and presumably, less to spend on the roads.

Maybe a Fortescue Roads company could be Forrest's next venture?

It is the subject of many a conversation outside Grandma's, and one that a chat with cattle producer Mandy White soon turns to.

""We were having problems before wind farms came along,"" she says.

""So to have that on top, particularly over the range where it's a narrow road and it's in bad need of repair …""

But Mandy, too, has benefited from the community grants offered by the renewable companies, and hopes that in the long term, the industry will help underpin her town.

Sue is hoping the energy transition might see another family like hers choose to relocate to Marlborough.

""We need sustainability, we need people to not come and go, we need people to stay,"" she says.

The growing pains of industrialisation

For a long time, this part of Queensland has been known for cattle and coal, with both industries commanding a certain loyalty.

But as big resources companies like Rio Tinto commit to ambitious carbon reduction targets, the area is also leading the way with power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy companies, driving future development in the region.

Coal isn't dead yet, but the demands of renewable companies are changing the dynamics of nearby industrial centres like Rockhampton.

James Selman has been working as a boilermaker in Rocky for the last 15 years. Recently, his company has begun writing some big invoices for renewable energy projects.

""We've built a lot of framework for solar farms — quite a lot, maybe about a thousand frames,"" he says, casting a line into the Fitzroy River.

""It's a growing demand, everybody wants solar in this region.""

One of his set lines starts to bend violently. A fish breaks the water, and there's a brief hope it could be a decent sized barramundi or threadfin salmon.

As it gets closer to the bank, the head of a small bull shark breaches the surface. The trace jags on a tooth and it's lost to the river.

Rockhampton is hoping to host the 2032 Olympic rowing around here, provided Queensland senator Matt Canavan can convince the committee that crocodiles won't be an issue.

But arguably the hottest topic around town is renewables. Senator Canavan and his Nationals colleague Michelle Landry, the local member for Capricornia, are among the most vocal political critics.

James is too busy working or fishing to be caught up in that.

""I don't really follow it, but I think maybe they're trying to cover themselves,"" he ponders.

It's difficult to distil what's driving this regional resistance into one simple truth.

Much of the anti-renewables rhetoric that generates headlines is tangled with political interest or framed in a way that amplifies the city-country cultural divide.

Research has shown there is a gap in public perceptions here, too. Broadly, views on climate change and renewable energy in regional and rural areas are similar to those of city-dwellers, but people believe they're different.

Renewables proponents argue this is part of a strategic campaign to mislead people into believing regional Australians, and specifically farmers, oppose renewable energy.

It's familiar subject matter for social researcher Rebecca Huntley, who has been spending lots of time talking to people in communities on the frontline of the renewables rollout.

""The biggest thing people say is, don't make the problems we have worse, and do the kinds of things that will help us trust that you'll actually deliver on the promises that you're making to the local community,” she says.

Generally, Dr Huntley says about 5 to 15 per cent of people who live in renewable energy zones (REZ) are ""angry enough to join a Facebook group"".

""Some of that resistance is just resistance, and some of it's genuine,"" she says.

Dr Huntley estimates about 20 to 30 per cent are generally supportive of the renewable energy transition and the associated economic activity, and the rest are unsure or ""hopeful it'll be OK"".

""The reality is there's probably more support than opposition, but the predominant sense is: 'I don't really know what's happening, what's the plan, and what is the local benefit?'"" she says.

There's certainly some ""genuine"" resistance around Rockhampton.

A large battery energy storage project, or BESS, in the nearby community of Bouldercombe has recently been rejected by the local council after intense community pushback.

Coalition figures and community groups have also been raising concerns about the associated environmental destruction involved with building big wind projects.

""I just think that there is a political game here with the anxieties, including the justified anxieties of communities about what is going to happen with these projects and whether they're actually going to bestow a real lasting benefit,"" Dr Huntley says.

""This is the growing pains of the transition — but if we don't get it right, it could be more than just growing pains, it could be real buyer's remorse for some of these communities.""

At the top of the range, Andrew Forrest is reaching the end of his sermon.

""I'd like to see every renewable energy company do what Squadron has done, which is put money straight back into the community,"" he proclaims.

""Build out mobile networks, build out cheap electricity systems, give people $1,000 rebates if they're within 20 kilometres.""

It's worth pointing out there aren't many people living within that radius of Forrest's wind farm, but perhaps it's something.

""Wind farms are a wonderful future, solar farms are a wonderful future, but when they connect to cities, then we must recognise that those connections also are a cost to people.""

That seems to be the sentiment at the Marlborough Hotel, too.

RWE has completed construction of its first project in Louisiana, the 100 MW Lafitte Solar facility in Ouachita Parish near Monroe. The project will be fully operational by the end of the year and is backed by a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with Meta, which will receive all associated environmental benefits, including RECs.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held with Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, parish officials, RWE leadership, employees, and EPC partner McCarthy Building Companies. Over its lifetime, Lafitte Solar is expected to generate roughly $32 million in local tax revenue, supporting schools, law enforcement, and emergency services. Construction created more than 150 peak jobs and supplied meaningful economic activity for local businesses throughout the project.

Andrew Flanagan, CEO, RWE Clean Energy, said, “Lafitte Solar is RWE’s first project in Louisiana, and will provide low-cost, homegrown energy to the Louisiana grid and generate enough electricity to power 17,000 local homes and businesses. By providing affordable and reliable electricity, we are strengthening Monroe’s power supply while supporting the community’s growth and resilience.”

This migration is reshaping the U.S. business landscape, with firms citing lower taxes, a business-friendly environment, and a growing talent pool as key attractions.
The Texas Tribune reported that from 2010 to 2019, Texas generated more jobs from relocations than any other state, with anecdotal evidence suggesting continued growth post-pandemic (Texas Tribune).
Future Implications for U.S. Business The migration is fostering innovation hubs in Austin and Dallas, rivaling Silicon Valley.
Governor Abbott’s X post celebrates Texas as the ‘king of headquarter relocations,’ underscoring the state’s strategic positioning in America’s evolving corporate map.","In recent years, Texas has emerged as a magnet for corporate relocations, drawing major companies from high-tax states like California and New York. This migration is reshaping the U.S. business landscape, with firms citing lower taxes, a business-friendly environment, and a growing talent pool as key attractions. According to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas led the nation in business relocations from 2010 to 2019, generating more jobs from these moves than any other state (Dallasfed.org).

The trend has accelerated post-pandemic, with over 200 companies relocating or expanding to Texas since 2020. High-profile moves include Tesla’s headquarters shift to Austin in 2021, Oracle’s relocation from Redwood City to Austin in 2020, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s move to Spring, Texas. These shifts are not isolated; they reflect broader economic incentives, including no state income tax and regulatory relief, as highlighted in a compilation by Build Remote (Buildremote.co).

The Pull of Economic Incentives

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has actively promoted the state as a hub for business, noting in a post on X that Texas accounts for about half of all U.S. headquarters relocations. This is supported by data showing Texas as home to 55 Fortune 500 companies, the highest in the nation, per U.S. Global Investors on X. Companies like Charles Schwab and Chevron have also made the move, drawn by tax breaks and lower operational costs.

Recent news underscores this momentum. Coinbase announced in November 2025 that it is shifting its incorporation from Delaware to Texas, following Tesla’s lead, as reported by CNBC. The crypto platform’s legal chief cited Texas’s business-friendly laws in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, emphasizing protections against fiduciary duty lawsuits (CNBC).

Tech Titans Lead the Charge

The technology sector has been particularly active in this exodus. Apple is planning a 250,000-square-foot AI server factory in Houston, joining Meta, HP, and Samsung in expanding Texas operations. Mario Nawfal noted on X that Texas tech jobs have grown 4.7%, signaling a shift from Silicon Valley to what some call the ‘Silicon Prairie’ (ARC Relocation).

Nasdaq’s announcement of a new regional headquarters in Texas further illustrates Wall Street’s pivot. This follows the New York Stock Exchange’s plans for a Texas-based exchange, as posted by Mario Nawfal on X. The Daily Mail reported on Coinbase’s move as part of a broader ‘blue-state exodus’ driven by regulatory burdens (Daily Mail Online).

Beyond Tech: Diverse Industries Join In

Energy and finance sectors are also relocating. GAF Energy, a solar panel company, is leaving California for Georgetown, Texas, consolidating operations amid rising costs in the Bay Area, according to the Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles Times). In finance, major banks are building massive complexes in Dallas, with employment poised to rival New York levels, as noted in X posts from users like LillianRaisedMe.

The Texas Tribune reported that from 2010 to 2019, Texas generated more jobs from relocations than any other state, with anecdotal evidence suggesting continued growth post-pandemic (Texas Tribune). Success magazine outlined reasons for 2025 moves, including a skilled workforce and infrastructure investments (Success).

Challenges Amid the Boom

While the influx brings economic benefits, it’s not without hurdles. Rapid growth in cities like Frisco, forecasted as Texas’s top mover destination in 2026 by MoveBuddha and reported in Frisco Enterprise, strains infrastructure and housing (Frisco Enterprise). Business Insider’s list of major relocations highlights how Texas competes with Florida for these shifts, driven by similar pro-business climates (Business Insider).

X posts from users like Allegra Fox discuss financial firms escaping New York’s costs, predicting Texas as a financial powerhouse by 2028. Charterhouse Square noted over 200 headquarters moves to Texas in the past five years, including Tesla and Oracle.

Policy and Cultural Shifts Driving Migration

Texas’s 2023 law allowing companies to cap fiduciary duty lawsuits has been pivotal, as seen in Coinbase’s decision, per X user RumDoxyTheatre. David Draper on X described this as the ‘Dexit’ trend, with Delaware losing ground due to less predictable courts.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-11-15 12:59:47+00:00,Yahoo News,Opinion - America's energy bills shouldn't fund Big Tech's data centers - Yahoo,"Mark MacCarthy and David Klaus, opinion contributors",,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/opinion-america-energy-bills-shouldn-160000786.html,"The proposed rule would make data centers “responsible for 100 percent” of certain costs they impose on the energy system.
Goldman Sachs estimates that the AI industry needs to spend $1.4 trillion in the United States by 2030 on power and utilities for its AI scaling bet.
Data centers should pay these incremental capacity costs they impose on the system, rather than having them allocated to all retail customers generally.
The secretary of Energy’s emphasis on making AI data centers pay the costs they impose on the system is welcome.
Secretary Wright’s proposal is forward-looking, but it must be implemented in a way that assures AI data centers pay their fair share.","Secretary of Energy Chris Wright recently sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission directing it to open a rulemaking to facilitate access to the electrical grid by both new generating facilities and AI data centers. The proposed rule would make data centers “responsible for 100 percent” of certain costs they impose on the energy system.

This is the right direction for a national energy policy that would accommodate the needs of the AI industry and potentially help protect ordinary ratepayers from the costs and risks of upgrading the energy system for AI data centers.

Our major concern is protecting the residential and non-data center ratepayers, which is also increasingly the concern of political leaders running for office. But that is not the focus of the Energy secretary’s proposal.

Perhaps out of deference to state ratemaking authority, the word “ratepayer” does not appear in either his letter or his notice of proposed rulemaking. Without a consumer focus, the implementation of the secretary’s plan has the potential to force ordinary ratepayers to subsidize the AI experiments and energy demands of some of the world’s richest corporations.

AI companies’ plans for gigantic data centers constitute a questionable bet that scaling, that is, more computation for training AI models, will by itself produce breakthrough AI models possessing artificial general intelligence, models with capacities to match or exceed human cognitive capabilities across the board.

Increasing numbers of experts including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, AI pioneer Yann Lecun and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence warn that transformative AI will require a new approach beyond doubling down on today’s machine learning models.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt thinks a better approach would be to downplay the vast computational bet on scaling and concentrate on applying today’s models to today’s very real social needs, an approach adopted by China.

But the industry is intent on its scaling plan and has the resources to finance it. In their most recent earnings reports Google, Meta and Microsoft announced plans to accelerate capital spending in the coming years, focused primarily on AI data centers, and funded out of the companies’ own cash flow or high-quality corporate bonds.

The limiting factor, however, might be energy. The huge data centers the AI industry envisages are needed primarily for developing more capable AI systems, not for running existing ones in response to everyday use by businesses and consumers.

Utilities will be challenged to meet this demand given the magnitude and accelerated timing of AI company requests. Goldman Sachs estimates that the AI industry needs to spend $1.4 trillion in the United States by 2030 on power and utilities for its AI scaling bet.

Data center AI energy demands are already poised to impose future costs on retail customers if steps are not taken to prevent this. In the capacity auction held by grid operator PJM in July 2025, projections of data center energy demand drove up system-wide energy capacity costs by $7.3 billion, or 82 percent, according to a report by Monitoring Analytics.

Data centers should pay these incremental capacity costs they impose on the system, rather than having them allocated to all retail customers generally.

The secretary of Energy’s emphasis on making AI data centers pay the costs they impose on the system is welcome. But a lot depends on the details such as which costs are allocated to the data centers, when they will have to pay them and what happens if they no longer need the power.

How can ratepayers be protected from the risks of stranded investment if the industry’s AI scaling bet proves to be unfounded?

One idea comes from a recent request from the utility Peco that FERC approve a transmission security agreement between the utility and Amazon requiring revenue guarantees regardless of whether Amazon ultimately uses the power and early termination fees. The utility ComEd has a similar plan for AI data center revenue guarantees and other safeguards to protect ordinary customers

These revenue guarantee proposals might not be sufficient to fully protect ratepayers. As Monitor Analytics points out in asking FERC to deny Peco’s petition, the utility has not done an assessment of whether there is adequate generation capacity to provide for the power Amazon says it needs. But the framework of revenue guarantees is a step in the right direction.

Secretary Wright’s proposal is forward-looking, but it must be implemented in a way that assures AI data centers pay their fair share. As his proposals and others at FERC and before state regulators around the country move forward, legislators, public interest groups, academics and think tanks need to keep the focus on protecting the ratepayer, not simply clearing out the underbrush for the AI industry.

President Trump has essentially cut funding for a massive hydrogen hub in the Golden State, and industry experts, along with Gavin Newsom, have lamented the position taken by the current administration. Now, it has emerged that in response to the cuts in federal funding, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) will immediately halt hydrogen hub activities in California, undermining the US energy transition.

The federal government, under Donald Trump, has cut funding for hydrogen development in California

Hydrogen has become the most viable form of energy generation in the world, but has faced some significant challenges in certain regions of the globe, none more than in the United States. While the rest of the world embraces the potential of the renewable energy sector with open arms, the US has seen its federal government recently cut off funding for hydrogen hubs in California, and could potentially do the same in other US states.

The reports are that due to the funding cuts pioneered by the Trump administration, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems has halted plans to develop a hydrogen hub in the Golden State and has handed over administrative oversight to the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) and the University of California.

“While this change reflects shifting federal investments, California remains firmly committed to developing a renewable hydrogen ecosystem as part of its broader clean energy transition. Clean hydrogen can play a pivotal role in helping the state move away from fossil fuels, driving innovation and supporting healthier, more sustainable communities. – statement from ARCHES

Trump is waging a policy war with the Golden State of California

The move by the federal government to cancel approximately $1.2 billion in funds for California’s planned hydrogen hub points to a more concerning state of affairs in the US. Trump has been waging a theoretical war against his detractors, and California is being hit the hardest. Mr Trump recently sent ICE agents to LA to clamp down on undocumented immigrants.

That has been followed up by a recent vote in the California halls of power to redistrict several areas that would give the Democrats five more seats in Congress, effectively canceling out a similar move in Texas. The response from the Trump administration has been to cut off billions of federal funding for the planned hydrogen hub in California, which would have turned the US into a global leader in the sector.

The renewable energy sector has faced a tough time trying to persuade the US President to change his stance and embrace the sector. The US is in danger of meeting the global embrace of the hydrogen sector, with other nations setting their sights on becoming hydrogen hubs in the near future, such as the Middle East.

Legacy automakers, meanwhile, must thread this needle while simultaneously investing in and profiting from their internal combustion portfolios.
Clear Eyes Win There lies the fundamental problem for legacy car companies.
Gas car companies and electric car companies aren’t just building different devices, they’re building different ecosystems.
Maybe legacy automakers can find away around these problems.","Tesla changed the world in 2012. The company existed long before that. But that was the year when the company proved its thesis. The brand launched the Model S, creating a brand new product category out of whole cloth, and blowing countless others to bits with its all-electric super sedan.

Through iterative improvements, Tesla would go on to build the world’s best-selling premium sedan, its best-selling EV, its best-selling luxury sedan, its best-selling SUV and its best selling vehicle, period, depending on the year. It is worth more than every other car company combined

Yet most of the so-called “legacy” automakers have not been able to follow its lead. None of them build EVs at a consistent profit. And none of them are quite ready to build the whole system, as Tesla does.

When Tesla built the Model S, it also built up a sales, service and charging ecosystem that made owning one pleasant. Many automakers still haven't learned how to do that with EVs.

End-To-End

Last month, I took a road trip in a 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT. It is the absolute best EV that any “legacy” automaker sells in the U.S. It is the best you can do, if you don’t “build the full stack.”

The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT is one of the best EVs made by a ""legacy"" automaker.

But Tesla builds the whole stack. There’s a robust charging infrastructure that is more seamless than any non-Tesla system at typically far lower prices. The vehicles are purchased from no-haggle company stores, not dealerships with high-pressure finance departments. The cars integrate seamlessly with your home, your power grid, your solar panels. The only good hotel chargers in the country seem to have “Tesla” logos, as do the best home batteries.

This is weaponizing the core advantage of EVs: You use power everywhere. So your universal power bank should follow you everywhere. The more services you can connect to it, the more money you are going to make.

Tesla is increasingly integrating its solar, home energy and vehicle products.

Photo by: Tesla

Hyundai wants to do all of that. But it is its own fiefdom inside a conglomerate that is responsible for 11% of South Korea’s economy. It has the money and the stamina to do this, but it isn’t there yet. It wants to build up a full software and energy platform that integrates with the infrastructure and with other smart devices. But for now, in the auto sphere, it simply builds great EVs.

So when I set out on a 650-mile road trip this past weekend, I knew not to bother with Hyundai’s included route-planning software. I loaded up A Better Route Planner—an app now owned by Rivian, a competitor that builds most of its own stack—and used that instead. But since it wasn’t built by Hyundai, and the XRT is brand new, it didn’t know how efficient I’d be. And since the best app for doing this isn’t integrated with the Hyundai, my car wasn’t actively updating the plan with its real-world battery consumption.

More and more EVs have access to Tesla Superchargers. But on my Ioniq 5 road trip, I realized that charging third-party EVs still isn't as consistent as charging a Tesla.

Photo by: Suvrat Kothari

A Tesla does all of that automatically, and routes you only through the best chargers, because it only uses the ubiquitous Tesla Superchargers. Aha, Hyundai fans may say, but the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 can use Superchargers. It even has a native Tesla-style NACS plug, another sign of the brand’s utter dominance in this space. Yet even this didn’t solve its charging problems.

The first two Superchargers I visited refused to initiate the charging session. I tried on the Tesla app and using the supposedly automatic plug-and-charge feature. Neither worked. Because Superchargers were originally built for native back-end Tesla magic to sort everything out, there’s no way to identify or rectify faults. I called my contact at Hyundai, who gave me the default, scripted advice. When that didn’t work, I bailed to a Rivian-branded charger in a disused parking lot, and plugged in yet another adapter.

Rivian is also building its own charging network, albeit on a much smaller scale.

Photo by: InsideEVs

On the way home, I tried to use Hyundai’s route-planning software. It directed me to a CalTrans charger in the middle of the desert. The charger in question had one stall, operated at 50 kw—about one-fifth of the maximum charging speed of the car—and, most notably, has been closed for months for a construction project. It was also 25 miles from the nearest charger and the car’s efficiency declined as I drove, so if I had followed the Hyundai’s guidance, I would have likely ended up stranded in the Mojave desert.

It doesn’t matter how good the rest of the car is. If you can’t plug in a destination and trust the vehicle to figure out a reliable and efficient route, it’s not good enough.

A Long, Pricey Road

Representatives from Hyundai, General Motors and Ford et. al. will all explain how unfair it is to judge their cars by the condition of the infrastructure. They aren’t in the business of building gas stations, and that never stopped them. Why, suddenly, do EV companies have to be infrastructure companies, too?

Well, because EVs aren’t gas cars. They’re a new business, with new opportunities. And while automakers don’t have to build charging stations, home power systems and home charging setups, they should want to. If electric energy is the main way we accomplish work in the future—and, arguably, it already is—then you don’t want a piece of that pie. You want to own the pie shop.

Google is also trying to solve route planning. It wants to use its Gemini AI chatbot to direct you toward charging stations with specific food options, or amenities.

Photo by: Rivian

Tesla owns its bakery. But getting there was expensive and tough. Many automakers have still not caught on to the opportunity here. (I won’t name names because I don’t want to piss anyone off at Honda, Toyota or Stellantis.) Others are just now starting the journey Tesla set out on over a decade ago.

Among them, I’d wager that General Motors shows the most promise. The company already has a mature EV platform with a mostly-common software stack and good route-planning, albeit with a heavy assist from Google. It also has a real home-energy product, charging partnerships with EVGo, a stake in the Ionna charging network and a robust battery supply chain. It recently announced further pushes into home energy and robotics.

Brands like BMW, Hyundai, General Motors, Toyota and Honda have partnered up to build Ionna, a nationwide charging network. That's a good step in the right direction.

Photo by: Suvrat Kothari

Competitors have bets in some of these places. Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, Honda, Kia, Hyundai and Stellantis all invested in Ionna, and a few are working on their own charging products. But no one is near the scale or maturity of Tesla, and you can feel that every time you use their cars.

That’s because this isn’t an easy road. Tesla had the luxury of losing billions of dollars for years to make the business model attainable in the long term. Legacy automakers, meanwhile, must thread this needle while simultaneously investing in and profiting from their internal combustion portfolios.

Clear Eyes Win

There lies the fundamental problem for legacy car companies. Gas car companies and electric car companies aren’t just building different devices, they’re building different ecosystems. Every part of building, selling and servicing EVs is different, and the more you’re configured for selling gas vehicles, the harder it is to take advantage of these changes.

Tesla and Rivian have another key advantage over legacy rivals: They control their own retail networks, rather than relying on dealers for customer relations. That means it's much easier for the companies to educate and assist buyers.

Photo by: Rivian

How can you drive out cost if your tech has to be backwards-compatible with gas vehicles? How can you have top-tier over-the-air update capability if you’re supporting a bunch of cars that can’t quietly turn on to install them? How can you sell someone a $50,000 car without building a software tool that can guide it anywhere in the country?

Maybe legacy automakers can find away around these problems. They can build good-enough EVs until the infrastructure and supply chain matures, than take advantage of the lessons learned by companies that actually innovate.

But that’s a dangerous strategy. EV buyers tend to be loyal, and so if you miss the window to sell someone their first EV, you might not be in the conversation to sell them their second. You need a great product as fast as possible. And as Tesla has proven, if you can’t rely on infrastructure and software that’s already available, you’re going to have to build it yourself.

The vast majority, he said, will fall off because many project backers are new to the concept and don’t know what it takes to get a data center built.
States also are trying to do more to find out what’s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.
Still, PPL’s projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.
Ratepayers in Burgos’ Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills — attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they’ll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that’s ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”

Suspicions about skyrocketing demand

There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.

Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.

One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren’t set in stone or lack the heft — clients, financing or otherwise — to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.

Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.

Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won’t tell utilities if or where they’ve submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.

The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation’s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.

“Better data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,” the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.

Real, speculative, or ‘somewhere in between’

The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.

The coalition’s vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a “fundamental first step of really meeting this moment” of energy growth.

“Wherever we go, the question is, ‘Is the (energy) growth real? How can we be so sure?’” Tinjum said. “And we really view commercial readiness verification as one of those important kind of low-hanging opportunities for us to be adopting at this moment.”

Igal Feibush, the CEO of Pennsylvania Data Center Partners, a data center developer, said utilities are in a “fire drill” as they try to vet a deluge of data center projects all seeking electricity.

The vast majority, he said, will fall off because many project backers are new to the concept and don’t know what it takes to get a data center built.

States also are trying to do more to find out what’s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.

In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.

They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.

Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren’t sure if the power requests “are real or just speculative or somewhere in between.”

Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.

Electricity bills are rising, too

PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.

Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects “are real, they are coming fast and furious” and that the “near-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.”

The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.

Still, PPL’s projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.

Ratepayers in Burgos’ Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills — attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.

That’s why ratepayers need more protection to ensure they are benefiting from the higher cost, Burgos said.

“Once they make their buck, whatever company,” Burgos said, “you don’t see no empathy towards the ratepayers.”

The agreements were finalized a day before the two-day CII Partnership Summit scheduled to begin on Nov. 14. These Andhra Pradesh renewable energy MoUs aim to accelerate large-scale clean-energy development across multiple districts.

Chief Secretary and Special Chief Secretary (Energy) K. Vijayanand said the projects would support pumped hydro storage, green hydrogen, wind, solar, biofuels, and energy storage. He said the initiatives were expected to generate more than 69,800 employment opportunities once implemented.

Vijayanand said the MoUs reflected Andhra Pradesh’s wider effort to position itself as a national hub for energy transition. He said the exchanges, presided over by Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, aligned with the State’s goal of improving ease of doing business and enabling faster project execution.

The Andhra Pradesh renewable energy MoUs were signed between the New & Renewable Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh, the Energy Department, and participating companies. Energy Minister Gottipati Ravikumar and senior officials attended the signing.

Major firms participate

Several companies signed new agreements or expanded existing projects. The list included Navayuga Engineering Company Ltd., Chinta Green Energy Pvt. Ltd., ABC Cleantech (Evren) & Axis Energy Ventures, ReNew Group, Four Square Green Energy Pvt. Ltd., Indosol Solar Pvt. Ltd., and Hero Future Energies Pvt. Ltd.

Officials said the projects under these Andhra Pradesh renewable energy MoUs will be taken up in phases. They added that district-level monitoring mechanisms would support approvals, land identification, and infrastructure coordination.

According to the Energy Department, projects in pumped hydro storage and green hydrogen are expected to see early progress because of ongoing policy support and existing investor interest. Solar and wind projects will be planned based on resource availability and grid-integration capacity.

Background and context

Andhra Pradesh has focused on attracting renewable-energy investments over the past few years to meet rising power demand and strengthen grid reliability. The State has invested in transmission upgrades, renewable-energy corridors, and policy reforms to support developers.

Officials said the latest MoUs build on earlier agreements from investment summits and align with national targets for expanding non-fossil-fuel capacity. They said the State aims to balance industrial power supply, rural development, and long-term sustainability through diversified energy sources.

The CII Partnership Summit is expected to draw investors, industry leaders, and policymakers from across the country. Energy officials said the signing of the of these Andhra Pradesh renewable energy MoUs summit demonstrates Andhra Pradesh’s readiness to mobilize capital for large-scale clean-energy projects.

Kathy Hochul’s pivot away from climate policy.","When President Donald Trump returned to office, Democratic governors from the biggest and bluest states pledged to be bulwarks against the dismantling of Biden-era climate and clean energy policies.

But the Democrats’ fervor is showing cracks — as they face legal limits, shape-shifting political realities and economic headwinds.

Take Pennsylvania, where Gov. Josh Shapiro dismayed his green-minded supporters this week by agreeing to withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Northeast’s carbon cap-and-trade program. Shapiro, who’s long been cool toward RGGI, abandoned the climate program as part of a deal to end a months-long budget impasse with Republicans, Adam Aton reports.

“It is time now to look forward, and I’m looking forward to aggressively pushing for policies to create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto our grid and reduce the cost of energy for all Pennsylvanians,” the potential 2028 presidential contender said before signing the budget deal.

Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a natural gas pipeline that Trump supports and signed off on a deal to keep a gas-fueled cryptocurrency mining operation running for five more years, Marie French and Mona Zhang report. “We need to govern in reality,” she said, adding that there’s a “war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation.”

That’s in contrast to an action Hochul took late last year, when she signed the Climate Change Superfund Act, which requires energy-sector carbon polluters to pay for infrastructure improvements over the next 25 years.

More compromises on climate policies may be coming, even after Democrats scored sweeping wins last week in Virginia’s and New Jersey’s gubernatorial elections. That’s because the political balancing act of addressing cost-of-living problems, economic growth and climate policy is getting more complicated, not less.

Democrats recalibrate

California Gov. Gavin Newsom straddles sides of that dynamic. He made a rockstar appearance this week at the United Nations climate talks in Brazil, declaring that he and other supporters of climate action are “at peak influence because of the flatness of the surrounding terrain with the Trump administration and all the anxiety.”

But Newsom faces grumbling at home about how California’s Democratic leaders are standing up for the environment — or not.

The party has retreated on a cap on oil industry profits and clean fuel mandates, seemingly spooked by the potential for higher fuel prices if refineries close. And Newsom’s administration has tried to keep open one key refinery in Northern California.

The next big decision for a Democratic governor may come in Massachusetts. Lawmakers there are advancing, on a bipartisan basis, legislation to significantly water down the state’s major climate commitments, including making its 2030 emissions targets nonbinding and slashing money for energy efficiency.

COP Corner

A lonely platform: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) arrived at the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, on Friday — making him the sole U.S. federal representative at the U.N.-sponsored talks. The senator says he is trying to show that the American public still broadly supports addressing climate change. Whitehouse on Friday also alleged the State Department helped stymie U.S. lawmakers’ ability to attend the summit.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment but pointed to an earlier statement from a White House official saying that Trump “is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues.”

How Biden’s EV charging program won

Former President Joe Biden’s pledge to have 500,000 electric vehicle chargers on roads by 2030 fell far short — something Trump seized on in the 2024 election. But David Ferris reports that while the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program may have been a political failure, it’s a policy success.

That’s because of the progress made on NEVI’s overriding goal: to ease the charging process for drivers. The program established rules and requirements for chargers to ensure drivers could get the same charging experience wherever they went.

NEVI “forced the entire industry to raise its game around reliability, redundancy and performance that will be remembered as an important legacy,” said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which studies the EV charging network.

EU adopts binding (though weakened) climate targets

European Parliament on Thursday voted to set binding targets for reducing emissions by 2040, with centrist and left-wing lawmakers providing a majority of votes to fend off a push from the far right to kill it, Louise Guillot writes from Brussels.

The target calls for the European Union to reduce its emissions 85 percent compared with 1990 levels. The other 5 percent can be outsourced abroad through carbon offsets.

The target is a “solid compromise ... that combines environmental ambition with economic competitiveness,” said Lídia Pereira, a Portuguese member of Parliament.

Downsizing EPA

Nearly a fifth of the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce has opted into the Trump administration’s mass resignation plan, Kevin Bogardus reports.

About 2,620 employees have taken the “deferred resignation” offer at EPA, according to figures the agency shared with POLITICO’s E&E News on Friday. EPA has reviewed all its applications for the program, including all four rounds offered this year.

More than 17 percent of EPA staff, a sizable chunk of its head count, has left or will leave by the end of this year as part of the resignation program.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

DATA CENTERS ARE THREATENING GRIDS

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

DATA CENTERS MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

NATION’S LARGEST GRID OPERATOR HAS A PROPOSAL

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency. That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A DEAL IS SHROUDED IN SECRECY

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route. The electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract in August with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public, and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ELECTRICITY

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091625_AIStrainPowergrid_01_TedShaffrey.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 06:57:42.094021

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

DATA CENTERS ARE THREATENING GRIDS

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

DATA CENTERS MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

NATION’S LARGEST GRID OPERATOR HAS A PROPOSAL

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency. That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A DEAL IS SHROUDED IN SECRECY

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route. The electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract in August with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public, and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ELECTRICITY

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091625_AIStrainPowergrid_01_TedShaffrey.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 11:04:58.079028

In rescinding the Biden-era regulations, the Interior Department returned to management guidelines originally established in 1977, making it significantly easier to permit drilling and mining operations. This marks the latest step in the Trump administration’s push to focus U.S. energy policy on oil, gas and coal, after Biden prioritized renewable energy and environmental conservation.

“This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release. Burgum added that the action will “create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security.”

A final rule will be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 17, the Interior Department said.

What is the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska?

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska sits about 600 miles north of Anchorage. It is the largest single tract of public land in the United States and provides habitat for grizzly and polar bears, caribou and thousands of migratory birds.

Congress set aside the reserve in 1923 as an emergency petroleum supply. In 1976, Congress authorized commercial development while requiring protection of fish, wildlife and habitat.

Who supports and who opposes the decision?

Alaska Republican officials celebrated the announcement. Gov. Mike Dunleavy called it “yet another step in the right direction for Alaska and American energy dominance,” according to the New York Times. Sen. Dan Sullivan described it as “a new day filled with opportunity for Alaskans.”

Environmental organizations said they will challenge the changes in court. In a press release, Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the action “another example of how the Trump administration is trying to take us back in time with its reckless fossil fuels agenda.”

Nearly 55,000 people submitted comments opposing the repeal during the 60-day comment period, according to Earthjustice.

Monica Scherer of the Alaska Wilderness League accused the Interior Department of “sidelining science and traditional knowledge, silencing communities and putting irreplaceable lands and wildlife at risk,” the Times reported.

But in the decades since those heady days, plastic has developed a particularly bad reputation when it comes to sustainability.
In 2024, the UN's Secretary-General António Guterres said that the world is ""choking on plastic"", alluding to the chronic problem of plastic pollution.
""Earning the EcoVadis Gold Medal is a significant milestone that underscores our deep commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices,"" he says.
This means that plastic pollution will likely double to 44 million tonnes a year.","Bakelite, the Atlanta-based manufacturer known for producing the world's first ever 100% synthetic plastic, is often credited with kickstarting the age of plastics.

Bakelite resin was revolutionary from the moment it was first created, all the way back in 1907. The material quickly became familiar to millions, thanks to its applications in household goods like telephones, radios, jewellery and much more.

But in the decades since those heady days, plastic has developed a particularly bad reputation when it comes to sustainability. In 2024, the UN's Secretary-General António Guterres said that the world is ""choking on plastic"", alluding to the chronic problem of plastic pollution.

According to the OECD, just 9% of the world's plastic is recycled, with the rest filling landfills, incinerators or our oceans. What's more, scientists from the UN estimate that plastics may take more than 500 years to fully decompose.

So, with this in mind, it would be safe to assume that a plastic producer would struggle to be sustainable. Bakelite, however, is shrugging off this assumption.

Why Bakelite has been recognised for its sustainability

The firm was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal by sustainability ratings platform EcoVadis, positioning the thermoset resin manufacturer among the top 5% of all the 130,000 companies assessed worldwide for sustainability.

This recognition can be chalked up to Bakelite's new policies, its operational improvements and the expanded scope of its public reporting.

The firm has also made some big investments in infrastructure recently, including solar panel installations at its sites in Barry in Wales, Lantarón in Spain and Kitee in Finland, as well as a steam turbine at the firm's Botlek facility in the Netherlands.

There have also been several initiatives aimed at reusing water at Bakelite's sites in Oregon and a new chiller system in Louisville that is designed to reduce water consumption.

Bakelite's acquisition strategy

Bakelite's President and CEO JP Aucoin points to the company's recent acquisition of Sestec, describing the bio-based adhesives manufacturer of wood and composite materials as an important reason for the firm's trajectory.

""Earning the EcoVadis Gold Medal is a significant milestone that underscores our deep commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices,"" he says.

""Our recent acquisition of Sestec, a leader in bio-based adhesives for wood and composite materials, together with this recognition, reinforces our dedication to helping customers achieve their sustainability goals.""

The company's sustainability performance was driven by participation in initiatives including Responsible Care and ISCC Plus certification programmes.

Can plastic manufacturers improve recycling?

Despite all the furore and the calls for plastic production to slow, the OECD predicts that global plastic use is going to triple from 2019 levels by 2060. This means that plastic pollution will likely double to 44 million tonnes a year.

Naturally, manufacturers like Bakelite are under pressure from institutional investors when it comes to this subject, with many investors becoming more and more focused on environmental performance, including renewable plastics use, recycling, waste management and bio-based raw materials.

Advanced recycling technologies like chemical recycling and pyrolysis are under development, breaking down plastics into basic components for producing high-quality recycled materials.

That said, the transition to a fully circular economy is going to require huge capital investments, the kind of which many companies are struggling to justify against immediate financial pressures.

Bakelite, though, appears to be taking a proactive approach to the matter.

“We know that our dedication to sustainability will help us become a stronger company while also making a positive impact on our planet,” explains JP.

The company has a long way to go and many responsibilities to fulfil before it can be considered wholly sustainable, but it is clear that it is making an effort to move the dial.

As David Attenborough says: “Industrial pollution and the discarding of plastic waste must be tackled for the sake of all life in the ocean.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/aa410c9ec0958bfbfcb3a24912ac94e7:a94da347dd063f184cd4e558a0c8c8a3/the-ecovadis-gold-medal-is-a-coveted-award-in-the-world-of-coporate-sustainability.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 11:04:48.102116

But Hiett condemned the new order in favor of an older version, saying some new language came from OG&E.","After a series of meetings spanning multiple weeks, Oklahoma Corporation Commissioners voted Thursday to deny Oklahoma Gas and Electric’s request to use a cost-recovery measure called “construction work in progress,” or CWIP.

The state’s largest utility company sought to use the procedure to help finance the construction of two new natural gas turbines at its Horseshoe Lake Power Plant in eastern Oklahoma County. While OG&E received preapproval to build them and eventually charge customers for the cost, regulators specifically denied the use of CWIP.

Commissioners deliberated whether they were obligated to approve the mechanism under a new law requiring the Corporation Commission to allow CWIP for new or expanded natural gas infrastructure. But the law wasn’t applicable in this case, the regulators said, because OG&E filed its application before Senate Bill 998 went into effect.

Why did OG&E want to charge customers during construction?

The utility company wanted to buy more energy generation capacity, driven by rising electricity demand and the retirement of older facilities.

OG&E laid out plans to build the natural gas turbines, purchase power from a gas-fired generation facility in Pittsburg County and enter into a contract with a battery energy storage system facility near Woodward. CWIP collection would have financed the natural gas turbine construction.

Residents would have seen new monthly charges increase incrementally, the company announced, starting with about 60 cents in 2026 and ending with more than $4 in 2031.

Representatives for OG&E maintained during the length of the case that customers would have saved millions of dollars in interest over the life of the $506 million project.

The savings would total about $176 million, a spokesperson for OG&E said in October.

But commissioners argued that residents wouldn’t see the savings for years.

“The math is so absolutely clear that CWIP treatment is a detriment to rate payers, where if they enjoy any savings at all, it's going to be 25 years and beyond before they get that savings,” Commissioner Todd Hiett said during a Nov. 5 meeting.

“ Those customers may not be customers, they may not be alive. Those businesses may not be alive.”

Corporation commissioners disagreed on which final document to vote on

Commissioner Brian Bingman proposed an order that denied CWIP, but still granted preapproval to construct the turbines and buy power from two other facilities. His document also gave OG&E until July 2026 to draft a large-load tariff, which keeps residential customers from paying the same amount as facilities like manufacturing plants or data centers.

Bingman’s document also allowed OG&E to charge customers for 18 months once the new turbines are in service. After that, the company could include remaining costs in a general rate case.

But Hiett condemned the new order in favor of an older version, saying some new language came from OG&E. Hiett brought his own proposed order.

“I was just shocked to see the monopoly utility swoop in after the record is closed, and after a robust hearing, the company swoops in and completely rewrites the order,” Hiett said.

The two primary changes in the document involve extending the window for the large-load tariff filing and increasing the number of months the company can charge customers for the turbines before entering a new rate case, according to Louis Jackson, assistant and advisor to Bingman.

Proposed orders aren’t typically made public unless voted upon. StateImpact has not independently verified the changes.

“Both PSO and OG&E have been working for several years over at the legislature to systematically do two things: Remove themselves from regulation and strengthen their monopoly status,” Hiett said. “They were very successful in removing themselves from regulation last year with Senate Bill 998.”

Hiett said some of the new language was “nothing but propaganda,” urging Bingman and Chairman Kim David not to approve the proposed order.

“They're trying to capture this regulatory body, utilize this regulatory body through an order to promote propaganda, and this order should be rejected on those grounds alone,” Hiett said.

David and Bingman disagreed with Hiett’s comments, saying the changes were not significant.

“I'm highly offended by what you had to say,” David, who joined the meeting virtually, said. “You just basically accused us both of not being genuine, and the changes that were made in this order are not substantial changes.”

David and Bingman voted to approve the order, while Hiett voted against it.

In an email, Ken Miller, vice president of public and regulatory affairs for OG&E, wrote that Hiett’s comments were “baseless.”

“I’ve known Todd for a long time and he has never responded well to not getting his own way,” he wrote. “We take great offense to his characterization of OG&E’s advocacy for critical projects that meet Oklahoma’s growing demand for energy at low costs as highly inappropriate and unacceptable.”

Regulators explored consumer protection options during the case, as energy-hungry facilities like data centers come online

Before the final proposed order, commissioners discussed using three mechanisms meant to keep residential customers from paying the same monthly amount as large facilities: a large-load tariff, a production demand allocation and a true-up adjustment.

A large-load tariff is an agreement between a utility and a high-consumption customer, such as a data center. The tariff ensures bills for big consumers are calculated differently from smaller-load households or businesses.

The protection was included in the commission’s final order, directing OG&E to file a large-load tariff with the regulatory body by July 1. The agreement could be used to set rates as bigger customers come online.

Before the vote to deny OG&E’s request, a stipulation agreement written by the Office of the Attorney General, the commission’s public utility division and the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma included the production demand allocation and true-up mechanisms.

The allocator would update the amount of CWIP money charged to customers every year. As more high-consumption facilities come online, the amount owed by customers with smaller energy footprints would be expected to decrease.

The true-up mechanism would happen after the turbines come online. OG&E would have looked at its energy supply compared to when CWIP was first set. Some residential customers could see a refund in the form of lower bills after the company calculates final project costs.

More CWIP requests likely on the horizon

Although the commission denied its first case of CWIP under Senate Bill 998, more will probably be filed by utilities in the future.

During the Nov. 13 meeting, Bingman said consumer protections could be part of future CWIP cases.

“As you can tell, I was more taken with eliminating the CWIP, which I know we're going to see down the road,” he said. “But I think a lot of these protections that you're talking about, that as we go on down the road, some of those we will be able to put in place.”

In an email, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office wrote OG&E could come back to the commission with another CWIP request.

When asked if OG&E planned to challenge Thursday’s decision, a spokesperson wrote, “The commission and OG&E differed on the relevant effective date of the new law in this specific case. We believe it’s important to save customers a significant amount of money and will work to secure these savings in future cases.”

It’s unclear when the utility plans to file another case.

The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility ? which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals ? was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar's capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

""South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,"" said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. ""First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.""

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar's international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar's footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

""The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration's trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,"" said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. ""We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act's stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers' objectives.""

The latest edition1 provides an analysis of global energy and of the implications for energy security, environmental protection and economic development. The WEO uses a scenario-based approach to highlight the key choices, consequences and issues lying ahead and show how the energy system can be affected by the changing energy policies of governments around the world. The present paper identifies main conclusions to draw from this year’s edition in the difficult context of the competitiveness of the EU industry and with the pressing climate urgency in the background.

Energy Security Concerns Persist, but Prices Are Reasonable

Many sources of energy have associated supply security concerns, including the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and the new U.S. administration. The past few years have shown how quickly situations of dependencies can turn into vulnerabilities. This is not only valid for fossil fuels, but also for the more modern clean and renewable technologies. Geopolitical tensions and associated trade tensions are major risks for energy security and for coordinated action on the reduction of emissions.

However, even in this global context with many risks and uncertainties, the price levels of the main energy sources remain reasonable. Oil, for example, is around USD70/bbl and seems to be unaffected by the situation in the Middle East — a factor that has often been a driving factor of oil price spikes and crises in the past. The main reason for this seems to be the large overcapacity in the global oil market, essentially stemming from oil demand not growing as expected in China — something in part attributed to the electrification of Chinese transport. The WEO sees this spare capacity remaining and even growing to 2030, indicating that world oil consumption would flatten at around 100 million barrels per day between now and 2035, before decreasing in a more distant future.

The situation is similar on the global liquefied natural gas (‘LNG’) market, with existing overcapacities that will only grow over the next years with the additional LNG capacities coming online between now and 2030. The WEO analysis comes to the conclusion that it is unclear where these additional LNG capacities will go and meet an increased demand — possibly in Southeast Asia or India. Possibly even backstop European consumption after cessation of Russian pipeline gas imports to Europe, with the US and Qatar holding onto their position as the world’s biggest suppliers in an increasingly complex interplay of market and geopolitical factors.

Competitiveness Issues Threaten the EU Economy

Whilst price levels on the world markets are reasonable, the EU economy is in a very unfavourable competitiveness position compared to other economies, such as that of the United States. The EU industry, which used to have access to relatively cheap Russian pipeline gas, is now relying on more LNG imports, which is more expensive at the global LNG price levels. This has been clearly identified by the Draghi Report.2 The EU industry is facing gas costs several times higher than the U.S. industry, which has access to cheap local gas (often shale gas). This difference in gas prices is also one of the reasons — but not the only one — why power prices are several times higher in the EU than in the United States.

Clean Tech Is Progressing — and So Is Electrification

Although it’s clear that there’s been a large increase in the number of large photovoltaic installations, as well as a swift increase in the use of electric vehicles worldwide, the last year has seen very slow progress in the use of wind energy and a decrease of the rate of deployment of heat pumps, which are essential for the electrification of heating and cooling in the building sector. Hence, a mixed picture.

These clean technologies are now a market of more than USD700 billion, more than half of which is in China — a significant geographical concentration. Additionally, there are fast-growing trade flows from China to Europe that are capable of covering a significant fraction of the EU future energy demand. The WEO states that a sea carrier full of photovoltaic modules carries equipment which will generate as much energy as there is in 50 LNG carriers over its expected lifetime. There is, however, a reason for worry in the fact that Europe is developing a dependency on China in many of these clean technologies, even if it is probably less dangerous than the dependency on gas or oil providers.

Electrification is making quick progress in China, based on the deployment of renewable energy sources, and allows a decrease of the use of coal. This is also taking place in several other large economies, but less so in the United States and the EU. The main drivers for an increased electricity demand are cooling, mobility, data and artificial intelligence. The use of electricity to decarbonise large traditional industrial sectors is not happening at a meaningful scale yet.

Despite Recent Success, Clean Tech Still Faces Obstacles

The current rate of deployment of clean technologies implies more or less stable CO2 emissions between now and 2035, which is clearly not Paris Agreement compatible. Last year looks to have been the warmest year ever since the industrial revolution, and it could well be confirmed as the first year to breach the 1.5°C limit over pre-industrial times. The vast majority of scientists would agree that this 1.5°C temperature increase of the Paris Agreement is now out of reach, and that the 2°C objective will quickly slip out of reach if trajectories are not swiftly modified. We would certainly need many more new renewable capacities, faster progress in efficiency measures and large investments in grids, system smartness and storage to allow electrification to accelerate.

The transition also requires large quantities of minerals and metals, some well-known and some exotic. In a general manner, these markets are not in a situation of overcapacity. They are very often concentrated, from a production and manufacturing point of view, in a reduced number of countries, with a large proportion in China. To take just an example, simple things like the availability of copper could quickly become problematic. Recycling can provide a partial answer, but it seems inevitable that more mining activities should be developed in order to avoid crises of undercapacity or unacceptable dependencies on a reduced number of suppliers.

So, Where Do We Go From Here?

For Europe, increasing its capacity to produce and use clean energy technologies is essential to ensure that the EU remains competitive on the global clean energy technology market. This will bring large benefits to the European economy and its citizens.

The EU is currently facing technological and non-technological challenges, such as high energy prices, critical raw materials supply chain disruptions and skills shortages. Strengthening the competitiveness of the EU clean energy sector is the only way to shape a more resilient, independent, secure and affordable energy system in Europe’s future.

The new mandate, Commission and Parliament, has this as a clear priority. It requires many adaptations to existing regulations and the fast introduction of several new ones.

“Africa is not waiting. We are leading.”

This declaration by H.E. Seyoum Mekonen of Ethiopia, served as both a guiding star and call to action at September 2025’s Africa Climate Summit in Addis. It is again relevant as world leaders gather in Belem, Brazil, for COP30 to hold critical discussions on our path forward when it comes to climate and energy. The Global South holds tremendous potential not only in renewable energy adoption but also in leadership, and Africa is an especially meaningful actor in that space.

When it comes to the energy opportunity, Africa is positioned for energy abundance. RMI’s research shows that amid the plethora of energy options available, the continent is well positioned to be a renewable energy superpower, driving growth and prosperity with abundant, low-cost renewable energy. It is an exciting and inspiring moment, but not one without its challenges.

Africa struggles with an aging, expensive, fragile, and unequally distributed infrastructure that dampens economic tailwinds and leaves over 600 million Africans without electricity. More than half of Africans face unreliable electricity supply, and even if grid-connected, consistent access isn’t guaranteed. In fact, the average annual consumption remains far behind the 1,000 kWh modern energy minimum. Electricity demand is only projected to grow, with an expected surge of around 75 percent within this decade, most of it in sub-Saharan Africa. Africans will drive global population growth this century: Almost one in four people will live in sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, and by 2030, more than 40 percent of the world’s youth will be African — and they will need the energy, infrastructure, and income to live prosperously.

Meeting this challenge requires closing the energy access gap, bolstering resilience and security, and catalyzing economic opportunity. It is here that RMI’s Africa Energy Program is positioned to support by deploying truly transformational initiatives with our partners in the public, private, and philanthropic sectors.

Our vision

RMI’s aim is to improve energy efficiency, affordability, and reliability in sub-Sharan Africa — enabling 420 TWh of renewable energy, helping 390 million people access energy, and avoiding 250 million tons of CO2 emissions. Clean energy pathways can lift millions out of poverty, driving inclusive industrialization and economic growth. We further aim to scale solutions by unlocking climate finance and building local capacity, particularly for under-resourced sectors and localities.

Our vision is built across three strategic pillars that emphasize scalability, regional leadership, and resilience. They are:

Energy access

Our aim is to close the energy access gap and build affordable, resilient, reliable energy systems by scaling utility-enabled distributed energy resources (DERs) and advancing clean energy portfolios. RMI has been deeply involved in this work for many years, with the Africa Minigrids Program in partnership with UNDP and our constantly growing DER hub providing actionable, replicable proof points and templates for successful implementation.

Clean and resilient supply through innovative collaboration

We work to enable power sectors to shift toward clean, resilient, secure and reliable generation and efficiency, adapted to withstand climate and geopolitical shocks. While DERs, particularly distributed solar, have emerged as a crucial part of the solution, reaching universal energy access demands scalable and complementary approaches. Interconnected minigrids (IMGs) offer a compelling pathway forward, encouraging utilities and developers to work together, and our recent analysis of the first wave of IMGs in Nigeria shares key lessons learned and demonstrates the viability of this business model. Meanwhile, embedded generation can improve supply for customers in urban and peri-urban areas by injecting up to 20 MW of generation directly at the distribution level.

Green growth

As clean and affordable energy is made available, we support countries in putting that power to work. We partner with local communities, leaders, and entrepreneurs to leverage technology and attract investment that will drive industry and new economic sectors, create jobs, and establish a clean economy. Through emergent climate-tech solutions such as green ammonia fertilizer, green tower telecommunications, e-mobility, and energizing agriculture to spur productive use of energy, we’ve been able to support meaningful economic development and innovation by Africans, for Africa.

Our work rests upon these three pillars, which we hope to deepen and expand over the coming months and years as we look to scale our work across geographies in sub-Saharan Africa such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Zambia, Kenya, and South Africa. All of this takes place within the context of strong partnerships with local governments, utilities/distribution companies, project developers, and communities.

Workforce and finance as powerful market catalysts

All of these objectives are only achievable through the creation and cultivation of local capacity, and enabled by meaningful investment where it will make the most impact. Particularly in regions like Africa, with booming youth and labor needs, livelihoods depend on job availability and access. The clean energy industry is well positioned to not only absorb the supply of labor, but also power the industries to create a compounding effect and improve job supply.

RMI’s Global Women in Clean Energy program partners with local and global experts in Nigeria, Zambia, and Ethiopia to empower women fellows to lead the deployment of distributed energy resource projects, ensuring that women are not just participants but also leaders in shaping the future of clean energy. The program empowers women fellows to lead the deployment of distributed energy resource projects, ensuring that women are not just participants but also leaders in shaping the future of clean energy.

Meanwhile, challenges lie in chronic underinvestment at the critical early stages of project preparation, as financiers and investors struggle to find well-prepared, “bankable” projects that match their risk appetite and investment criteria. Prioritizing early-stage project finance and technical support can help turn global climate commitments and country ambitions into tangible outcomes and accelerate the delivery of climate finance goals.

RMI’s Catalytic Finance program helps derisk projects and deploy finance as an enabler of climate and energy solutions. We partner with the private and public sectors to increase absorptive capacity and mobilize capital to support investment in clean and resilient energy.

A time for action

Sub-Saharan Africa is at a pivotal moment — it must industrialize, and doing so requires expanded energy consumption and reliable energy supply.

Green industrialization offers a key opportunity for both clean energy abundance and economic development. Instead of a lower-value, unsustainable value chain dependent on fossil fuels, imports, and inferior legacy technologies​, Africa can boast a high-value, climate-positive, energy-agricultural-industrial value chain in and for the continent, taking advantage of the best emergent technologies in the world.​

Country leadership, partnership, and collaboration are the cornerstones of real impact. As global conversation centers on our energy future, COP30 has the opportunity to continue, deepen, and forge cooperation to ensure renewable electricity access for sustainable development and a low-cost, low-carbon, climate-resilient future.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture1.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 07:58:18.830385

It still has some vehicle inventory that doesn't qualify for credits, but management said once those are sold, its new vehicle builds in the fourth quarter will benefit from the tariff offsets.

3. Rivian was gross-profit positive for the second time this year

The company reported a small consolidated gross profit of $24 million in the quarter, a $416 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, and its second quarter of gross profit this year. It's not all sunshine and rainbows on this front, but it's making some progress that should be noted.

First, the company's automotive gross profit loss of $130 million was still a significant $249 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, thanks to increased average selling prices and cost reductions. What's more, Rivian had $154 million in software and services gross profit, improving $167 million from a loss in the year-ago quarter. The $167 million in gross profit as a result of its joint venture with Volkswagen.

While it was a good quarter on this front, Rivian will likely experience more fluctuations in its gross profitability, and investors shouldn't expect it to be positive from here on out.

Making the best of a difficult situation

Shareholders should keep an eye on Rivian's vehicle sales in the next quarter as the impact of the eliminated tax credits could cause them to be lower. Things could turn around a bit once the company launches its R2 model in the first half of 2026. It will have a lower starting price of around $45,000, which could be a catalyst for the EV maker, but it's still a big unknown at this point.

Still, as a shareholder, I'm pleased with Rivian's latest quarter, and it appears to be managing a difficult time in the EV industry very well.

With carbon capture and storage poised to take American energy dominance to new heights, we were years ahead of any other state.

As the Trump administration repealed many of the Biden-era tax credits, it doubled down on support for carbon capture and storage in the One Big Beautiful Bill because the technology is viable and has a market demand.

Investments like this coming to fruition can create more of the job opportunities that will keep our kids here in Louisiana and improve lives across our state.

But as we’ve had the opportunity to use this existing technology to supercharge Louisiana’s economy past other Southern states, we have spent two legislative sessions debating whether to kneecap the biggest economic advantage Louisiana has had in our lifetime.

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it has awarded Texas with Class VI primacy, officially erasing Louisiana’s head start. My counterpart at the Texas Oil and Gas Association Todd Staples is saying “Texas is now poised to lead the world in CCS, which means more investment and more jobs for Texans.”

While we no longer have the lead, the game is not over. Companies are deciding, right now, whether it is better to do business in Louisiana or Texas. They are looking at regulatory uncertainty, the influence of antibusiness trial attorneys, and the hesitancy of a state to seize clear opportunities.

The company also said that its deliveries of 13,201 in the quarter will be its highest quarter for the year.
Rivian was gross-profit positive for the second time this year The company reported a small consolidated gross profit of $24 million in the quarter, a $416 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, and its second quarter of gross profit this year.
What's more, Rivian had $154 million in software and services gross profit, improving $167 million from a loss in the year-ago quarter.

That sent Rivian's stock soaring by more than 20% following the results.

But it's important to put the latest results into context. So let's look at three important takeaways from the third quarter and what they might mean for the electric vehicle (EV) company.

1. Revenue was higher than expected, thanks to tax credits

Automotive revenue jumped 47% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, with management saying the increase was driven in part by increased vehicle deliveries and a rise in average selling prices. That helped boost consolidated revenue by 78% to about $1.6 billion.

It's important for investors to know that part of the sales increase was also due to customers rushing to buy a vehicle before the EV tax credits expired at the end of September. The company's EVs were too expensive to directly qualify for them, but some customers were able to take advantage of leasing loopholes.

With the credits now expired, management said on the earnings call that it doesn't expect to have meaningful revenue from the sale of regulatory credits, ""and we've taken those out of our forecast."" The company also said that its deliveries of 13,201 in the quarter will be its highest quarter for the year.

In short, a rush by customers to get their hands on a new Rivian was partly fueled by credits, which helped boost deliveries and sales.

2. Tariff costs will be much lower

Tariffs have already caused a lot of turmoil in the auto industry, and their impact has had Rivian and its peers scrambling to find ways to lower costs. But a recent policy change from the Trump administration allows for vehicles built in the U.S. -- as Rivians are -- to receive a partial credit that helps offset some of the tariffs.

That's the technical way of saying that tariffs are going to be cheaper for the EV maker. Chief financial officer Claire McDonough said on the earnings call that the previous tariff impact on each vehicle in the third quarter was just under $2,000, but it will be reduced to just ""a few hundred dollars per unit"" for its new builds.

Tariffs of any amount aren't great for Rivian, but the new, lower costs are a big win for the company. It still has some vehicle inventory that doesn't qualify for credits, but management said once those are sold, its new vehicle builds in the fourth quarter will benefit from the tariff offsets.

3. Rivian was gross-profit positive for the second time this year

The company reported a small consolidated gross profit of $24 million in the quarter, a $416 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, and its second quarter of gross profit this year. It's not all sunshine and rainbows on this front, but it's making some progress that should be noted.

First, the company's automotive gross profit loss of $130 million was still a significant $249 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, thanks to increased average selling prices and cost reductions. What's more, Rivian had $154 million in software and services gross profit, improving $167 million from a loss in the year-ago quarter. The $167 million in gross profit as a result of its joint venture with Volkswagen.

While it was a good quarter on this front, Rivian will likely experience more fluctuations in its gross profitability, and investors shouldn't expect it to be positive from here on out.

Making the best of a difficult situation

Shareholders should keep an eye on Rivian's vehicle sales in the next quarter as the impact of the eliminated tax credits could cause them to be lower. Things could turn around a bit once the company launches its R2 model in the first half of 2026. It will have a lower starting price of around $45,000, which could be a catalyst for the EV maker, but it's still a big unknown at this point.

Still, as a shareholder, I'm pleased with Rivian's latest quarter, and it appears to be managing a difficult time in the EV industry very well.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/841920/20230302_ryan-salm_tahoe_1082_zwcadn.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 04:58:27.625956

""Right now, we are deliberately losing our competition on solar, on wind, on battery storage, on electric vehicles and all the support technologies that go into that,"" he said in an interview.
""It is a huge self-administered blow that Trump is doing, entirely to pay back his fossil fuel donors.""
Trump and Republican lawmakers have rolled back clean-energy tax credits and scrapped incentives for electric vehicles, prompting General Motors to scale back production.
Whitehouse's team said he will meet with ""heads of state, lawmakers, private sector leaders, environmental champions, and civil society leaders"" during his visit.","Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, one of only a handful of senior US political leaders attending this year's UN climate summit, told AFP Friday that President Donald Trump's America is ""deliberately losing"" the clean tech race to China.

The 70-year-old lawmaker said he had come to Belem, Brazil, to underline that Trump's aggressively pro-fossil-fuel policies do ""not represent the American people"" -- and that the United States is forfeiting a vast economic opportunity.

""Right now, we are deliberately losing our competition on solar, on wind, on battery storage, on electric vehicles and all the support technologies that go into that,"" he said in an interview.

""It is a huge self-administered blow that Trump is doing, entirely to pay back his fossil fuel donors.""

Whitehouse said that as he arrived in the Amazonian city in the early hours of the morning, he passed numerous Chinese electric vehicle dealerships -- a sight that hammered home his message about America falling behind.

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to the COP30 summit, leaving only a few prominent Democrats to attend in an unofficial capacity, including California Governor and presumed 2028 presidential-candidate Gavin Newsom.

""The Trump administration does not represent the American people on climate,"" said the Rhode Island senator, known for his long-running ""Time to Wake Up"" speeches on global warming in Congress.

""They are doing political work for the fossil fuel industry and the public very much supports climate action,"" he continued, citing a slew of polls to back his point.

For Whitehouse, one of the few remaining pathways to climate safety lies in carbon pricing, which he argued is essential to spark the innovation needed to slash emissions.

""If it's free to pollute, there's really no pathway to safety,"" he said, reiterating his support for Europe's carbon border tax -- a key point of contention with developing countries at COP30.

Trump, who received hundreds of millions of dollars from oil and gas giants during his presidential campaign, pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement for a second time on the day he returned to office.

Trump and Republican lawmakers have rolled back clean-energy tax credits and scrapped incentives for electric vehicles, prompting General Motors to scale back production.

Whitehouse's team said he will meet with ""heads of state, lawmakers, private sector leaders, environmental champions, and civil society leaders"" during his visit.

But he cannot take part in negotiations on the COP's outcome.

Attending the conference itself was made more complicated by resistance from the State Department, he said, which forced him to get his badge through a nonprofit organization.

""I've never seen the State Department be completely unwilling to support members of Congress traveling on an official Congressional Delegation, even to the point of refusing to help us get badges.""

The land swap, approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior last month, would open up a section of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.
All say the trade and planned road violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and other federal laws.
The lawsuit alleges that the land deal violates both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the federal Wilderness Act.
The land trade he approved would convey a little less than 500 acres of refuge land, most of it designated wilderness, to the Native-owned King Cove Corp.","Three tribal governments and several environmental groups sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to try to block a land trade that would allow a road to be built through a national wildlife refuge in southwestern Alaska.

The land swap, approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior last month, would open up a section of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Supporters argue that the road is needed to connect the community of King Cove, home to about 750 people, with a legacy military airstrip that can accommodate jets. That would give King Cove’s residents access to safer medical evacuations if needed. Opponents say the proposed road — to run 18.9 miles in total, most of that within what is currently refuge land — would damage world-class bird habitat that is in the heart of the refuge.

Wednesday’s challenges came in three lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Anchorage. All assert that the land trade and road development pose dire threats to migratory bird populations that use Izembek’s wetlands, including species with Endangered Species Act listings, and to the wider ecosystem. All say the trade and planned road violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and other federal laws.

The three lawsuits have their individual characteristics as well.

One of them, filed by tribal governments in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta villages, focuses on threats to traditional subsistence hunters who depend on the birds that use Izembek’s wetlands. The tribal plaintiffs are the Native Village of Paimiut, Native Village of Hooper Bay and Chevak Native Village.

“Izembek’s eelgrass wetlands are a lifeline for emperor geese, black brant and other birds that feed our families and connect us to Indigenous relatives across the Pacific,” Angutekaraq Estelle Thomson, traditional council president of the Native Village of Paimiut, said in a statement. “Trading away this globally important refuge for a commercial corridor devalues our lives and our children’s future. We are joining this lawsuit because defending Izembek is inseparable from defending our subsistence rights, our food security and our ability to remain Yup’ik on our own lands.”

The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental organization, is also a plaintiff in the case.

A second lawsuit, filed by Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, Wilderness Watch, the Alaska Wilderness League and the Sierra Club, puts a special focus on the process used to achieve the land swap and what it may mean for all wildlife refuges.

“Trading the ownership of refuge lands that Congress designated for conservation is a terrible precedent for the privatization of public lands. Building a road will have tremendous impacts on fish and wildlife habitat and could also greatly increase both disturbance and sport hunting pressure on vulnerable species,” Marilyn Sigman, president of Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, said in a statement.

The third complaint, filed by Defenders of Wildlife, puts a focus on the wider environmental impacts.

The planned road enabled by the land trade would “result in incalculable and irreversible damage” to myriad wildlife species, including marine and land mammals as well as migratory birds, that lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that the land deal violates both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the federal Wilderness Act.

“Under the Trump administration, the Interior Secretary entered into an illegal deal done in the darkness of a government shutdown: a sellout of one of our country’s largest and most pristine wildlife refuges and wilderness areas,” Jane Davenport, a senior attorney in Defenders of Wildlife’s Biodiversity Law Center, said in a statement. “Our treasured public conservation lands belong to all Americans. Defenders of Wildlife will stand up in court to hold this administration to account for recklessly and unlawfully trading them away.”

The Izembek Lagoon area, where the road is planned, holds the largest single stand of eelgrass in the world and the largest bed of seagrass along the North American Pacific Coast, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The entire Pacific population of black brant, a type of goose, uses the refuge’s lagoon area, feeding on the eelgrass. The refuge and its eelgrass support several other bird and mammal species; about half the world’s emperor geese use the refuge as a migratory stopover, according to biologists.

A Department of the Interior spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on the lawsuits.

Last month, however, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum touted the land exchange and planned road as long overdue.

He spoke about the project during an event called “Alaska Day,” a gathering in Washington with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s three-member congressional delegation. The Izembek land exchange was one of the pro-development Alaska actions announced at the event.

“It just seems preposterous to me that somehow, it’s taken 40 years for us to put people first,” Burgum said at the event. “Because I know one thing as a governor of a state: You can actually do things like build 18 miles of gravel road and still take great care of wildlife.” Burgum was North Dakota’s governor before being appointed as Interior secretary.

The land trade he approved would convey a little less than 500 acres of refuge land, most of it designated wilderness, to the Native-owned King Cove Corp. The corporation would give 1,739 acres of its land to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be added to the refuge, and the federal government would also pay the corporation for the land.

The idea of a road linking King Cove to the World War II-era military runway at Cold Bay dates back decades. The legal and political battle over the proposal has also been long. Some of the plaintiffs in the new cases were plaintiffs in previous lawsuits over proposed land trades. The dispute was being considered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but that court in 2023 determined that the case was moot and dismissed it because the Biden administration was not pursuing the plan endorsed by the first Trump administration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f33c8d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+180/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2Fe6%2F7da1fdf04da89f9695838006f368%2F30306353975-aa8950998b-o-2048x1436.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 07:58:30.470367

Thanks to government incentives, homeowners can take advantage of tax credits and rebates when they make eco-friendly updates to their homes.

Unlike gas stoves, induction stoves do not release any harmful pollutants into your kitchen, improving your home's indoor air quality. Induction stoves are also more energy-efficient and cook faster than gas stoves, saving you time and money in the kitchen.

However, upgrading to an induction stove sooner rather than later can save you even more money. Federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act are expiring by the end of 2025. As a result, if you switch to an induction stove before the year ends, you can receive up to $840 off the cost of an induction range. To claim these government incentives, simply submit an IRS Form 5695 when filing your taxes.

If a kitchen renovation isn't in your budget or you rent, you can still add induction to your home and reap these benefits. Plug-in burners are an affordable solution that don't require any home renovation to install. Plus, plug-in burners are relatively cheap, starting at just $50, so they're also a great option for homeowners looking to try out induction before making the full switch.

By upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, like an induction stove, you not only reduce the total cost of your home's energy bills but also decrease your household's pollution output. This is a win-win for your wallet and the environment, saving you money while reducing your environmental impact.

TCD readers who have made the switch to induction ranges have shared their positive experiences.

Last week, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems”.
Developing countries have called for the impacts and opportunities of mining minerals for the energy transition to be included in the text.
Marengo said the draft reflected many of the priorities voiced by producing countries, communities on the frontline of mining projects and Indigenous peoples across developing countries.
More than half of energy transition mineral reserves are estimated to be located on or near Indigenous land.","For the first time in UN climate negotiations, countries attending COP30 in Belém, Brazil, are grappling with the implications of extracting minerals required to manufacture batteries, solar panels and wind turbines.

On Friday, a draft text on ensuring that the transition to clean energy systems is just and sustainable – a negotiation stream known as the Just Transition Work Programme – recognised “the social and environmental risks associated with scaling up supply chains for clean energy technologies, including risks arising from the extraction and processing of critical minerals”.

It also “recalled” the principles and recommendations of a UN expert panel, which called on governments and industry to put human rights at the core of the minerals value chain, from mining to recycling. The UN panel report, published last year, set out key principles to ensure that mineral supply chains benefit countries and local communities endowed with resources, create jobs, diversify economies and generate revenue for development.

“For the first time, minerals are on the main stage of COP negotiations – no longer a side show,” said Melissa Marengo, a senior policy officer at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI).

Demand for metals such as copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel and graphite that are vital for manufacturing clean energy transition technologies is soaring. But extracting them creates both new economic opportunities, as well as social and environmental risks for resource-rich countries.

Around the world, increased mining activity has fuelled environmental destruction, deforestation and conflict with communities.

Last week, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems”. Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of rare earths, which are used to manufacture permanent magnets for EV motors and wind turbines.

Developing countries have called for the impacts and opportunities of mining minerals for the energy transition to be included in the text. African countries, which hold more than 30% of the world’s critical mineral reserves, have been vocal on the issue. The African Group of Negotiators told COP30’s opening plenary that Africa’s resources “must translate into tangible benefits”.

“Water is worth more than lithium,” Indigenous Argentine community tells COP30

Earlier this week, the UK, backed by Australia and the European Union, proposed language on the importance of fair, transparent, traceable and environmentally sustainable mineral supply chains for the energy transition.

The whole draft text, which is described as an “informal note” and is meant as the basis for negotiations on the Just Transition Work Programme, is bracketed, meaning that none of it has yet been agreed by countries.

Yet, campaigners widely welcomed the inclusion of minerals in the document as “a real first step”.

Marengo said the draft reflected many of the priorities voiced by producing countries, communities on the frontline of mining projects and Indigenous peoples across developing countries.

“But the real test begins now,” she said. “Parties must hold the line to secure strong social and environmental safeguards, fair value creation, and a genuinely just approach to transition minerals” that focus “on prosperity for producing countries and communities, and not only on supply security,” she added.

The text notes that affected communities must be “central” to the design and implementation of climate measures and recognises the importance “of sustainable patterns of consumption and production”, including through circular economy approaches.

It also acknowledges “the importance of the rights of Indigenous Peoples” including self-determination and their right to free, prior and informed consent for development projects that affect them, in addition to “the specific rights and protections for Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact”, which cannot give their consent to mining on their land.

More than half of energy transition mineral reserves are estimated to be located on or near Indigenous land.

“We are making history, as no previous COP decision has ever recognised the rights of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation and Initial Contact so clearly,” said ​​Bryan Bixcul, global coordinator of the Securing Indigenous Peoples’ Rights in the Green Economy (SIRGE) coalition. “Any attempt by countries to remove or weaken this text would represent a major setback for the fulfillment of those rights,” he said.

SIRGE has called for the text to go further still and establish exclusion or “no-go” mining zones on the land of uncontacted Indigenous groups.

COP30 could confront “glaring gap” in clean energy agenda: mining

Meanwhile, the inclusion of language on the “transition away from fossil fuels” remains deeply contentious, with references to fossil fuels only included as “options” in the text, meaning not everyone agrees to it being there. Saudi Arabia, large emerging economies such as India and China, and African countries opposed references to fossil fuels, according to observers present in the negotiating rooms.

To help deliver a just energy transition beyond COP30, the draft text includes a demand from an alliance of 134 developing countries – known as the G77 and China – to establish a mechanism that could act as a one-stop shop to provide countries with technical assistance and help foster international cooperation.

The idea has been resisted by developed countries, which argue that creating another institution would take a long time and risk duplicating the work of existing initiatives. Alternative options include “improving existing modalities”, “developing a policy tool box” and “developing guidance” to support countries deliver just transitions.

These alternatives amount to “tweaking”, Teresa Anderson of ActionAid International told reporters. “We know that if those modalities worked, we would not be in the crisis we are facing now.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/07/Broken-lithium--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 06:57:27.512209

It's a big step forward for the nascent—and in some ways, promising—competitor to conventional lithium-ion batteries. But sodium-ion tech still has hurdles to overcome.

Experts say sodium-ion batteries have several advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries. They experience far less degradation over time, demonstrate superior performance even in extreme cold and can cost comparatively less when scaled.

But there are trade offs. The cells have lower energy density than lithium-ion ones, which makes them more suitable for energy storage systems or less demanding applications like low-cost EVs. And the technology just isn't as mature as lithium iron phosphate (LFP), the low-cost lithium-ion chemistry that's taking off globally for both stationary storage and EV applications.

Peak Energy claims its sodium-ion energy storage battery can operate without active cooling, unlike lithium-ion batteries, which require complex cooling systems and fire-suppressant additives for safety and performance.

Under its agreement with Texas-based energy provider Jupiter Power, Peak Energy will provide 4.75 gigawatt-hours of sodium-ion battery energy storage systems (ESS) for deployment between 2027 and 2030.

The company claims its grid-scale sodium-ion battery system can hold 3.1 megawatts hours of energy and operates at temperatures ranging from -40 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 to +55 degrees Celsius). That's enough energy to fully charge more than 40 EVs with an average pack size of about 75 kilowatt hours. The ESS has no moving parts, no fans and no cooling system pipes running between the cells, according to the company.

It has already deployed what it calls the world’s first grid-scale passively cooled sodium-ion battery at a site in Watkins, Colorado. As per the company, this battery can save more than $100 million in project costs over its lifetime.

Grid batteries, which look like large shipping containers, are becoming increasingly important for a few reasons. AI data centers, EVs and electric heating are expected to significantly boost demand for power in the coming years and decades. Renewable power generation is growing too, but it's intermittent. We need to store energy for times when the sun isn't shining or when the wind isn't blowing.

These stationary battery banks are different from EV batteries. They operate at controlled temperatures and are designed to repeat the same charge-discharge cycles, typically for over 20 years, which is a less demanding use case than that of EVs. EV batteries are exposed to different road conditions and varied climates and are subject to a wide range of charging cycles and mixed use cases.

Historically, grid-scale batteries in the U.S. have used nickel-based chemistries. But more recently, the market is pivoting to LFP cells. Sodium-ion’s entry to the ESS market could herald a new chapter if successfully deployed. But some experts remain skeptical.

“LFP batteries are currently the lowest-cost and most widely available option for energy storage,” Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technology and supply chain research at the research firm BloombergNEF, told me in an email.

As EV sales growth slows down in the U.S., more battery companies are pivoting to produce LFP batteries for ESS, including LG Energy Solution and Stellantis-backed NextStar Energy.

Plus, Peak Energy is not the only U.S. company that has tried to scale sodium-ion batteries in the country. California-based Natron Energy wanted to build a $1.4 billion sodium-ion battery gigafactory in North Carolina, but ceased operations this year due to funding issues, the Raleigh News and Observer reported. Another sodium-ion startup, Bedrock Materials, cited the dropping cost of lithium as a reason for why it closed up shop this year.

“Sodium-ion energy storage systems have the potential to compete with LFP in terms of energy density and performance, but they are a less mature technology and may not yet benefit from the same economies of scale as LFP,” Stoikou added.

It’s unclear where Peak Energy has sourced its sodium-ion batteries from or where they are manufactured. The company did not respond to InsideEVs’ request for comment by the time of publication.

Since their lower energy density could pose an issue for EVs, Stoikou expects sodium-ion batteries to play a larger role in ESS applications. But the road to wider deployment will be long. BNEF expects sodium-ion batteries to account for 5% of ESS capacity additions by 2035.

That’s not necessarily the case outside the U.S., however. China's CATL, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, revealed production-ready sodium-ion batteries for light-duty EVs and commercial trucks at this year’s Shanghai Auto Show. And electric scooters powered by sodium-ion batteries are already on sale in China, costing as low as $400.

Over in the U.S., whether sodium-ion battery tech remains a niche experiment or scales into a meaningful part of the country’s energy ecosystem remains to be seen.

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said the EPA has failed for months to release a report on PFNA, a type of PFAS contaminant. PFAS, often called “forever chemicals,” are man-made substances found in air, groundwater and drinking water across the country.

“There is no legitimate reason for this delay,” Pingree said.

“This isn’t just a few states,” she added. “Every state has these impacts.”

Pingree sent a letter last month to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding an update, but she said the agency has not responded. She argues the government shutdown is hardly a viable excuse.

In a statement, the EPA cited ongoing litigation as the reason for the delay and said “the Trump EPA is committed to addressing PFAS and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable.”

In May, the agency upheld Biden-era drinking water regulations on two PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, but said three others — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — remain under legal review.

Pingree said she worries the agency is bowing to industry pressure.

“We’re just worried that this follows a pattern of this administration being … bullied by the industry that, of course, doesn’t want to have to deal with this chemical,” she said.

Environmental advocates also accuse the EPA of ignoring clear scientific evidence. Kyla Bennett, a former EPA scientist who now works with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said PFAS exposure can cause developmental issues in children, obesity, cholesterol problems and thyroid disorders.

“My fear is that with these people running the agency, the American people are going to start to get sicker and sicker,” Bennett said. She described the environment for current EPA scientists as “hostile.”

Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who co-chairs the bipartisan PFAS Caucus, is also sounding the alarm. She accuses the EPA not only of delaying the PFNA report but of slowing PFAS cleanup work at military bases across the country.

Dingell joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers who sent a letter of concern to the Defense Department last month. She also plans to continue pressing the issue with Trump administration officials.

“I’m going to be relentless in pushing for action,” she said.",https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2025/11/EPANexstarDCB.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 12:00:22.529227

Energy stocks inched higher this week as oil futures climbed, while Enbridge rolled out a $1.4 billion upgrade to send more Canadian crude down to US refineries.

What does this mean?

The energy sector ended the week on a positive note, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund moving up 0.3%. Oil-focused funds led gains, as the United States Oil Fund rose 2.1%—mirroring a 1.9% pop in US West Texas Intermediate crude to $59.81 and a 1.6% rise in North Sea Brent at $64.00. Not every fuel joined the rally: the United States Natural Gas Fund shed 2.4% after natural gas futures slid 3.9% to $4.46. Meanwhile, pipeline giant Enbridge announced a $1.4 billion Mainline Optimization project to ramp up shipments of Canadian heavy oil to the US Midwest and Gulf Coast. While Enbridge shares dipped 0.8%, the plan points to strong demand for Canadian oil and steady investment in North American energy infrastructure.

Why should I care?

For markets: Oil’s gains put energy ETFs in the spotlight.

Climbing oil prices have pulled more attention to energy funds and oil-tracking ETFs, which often mirror moves in oil markets. That’s mostly been good news for investors leaning into oil-heavy indexes—though natural gas has dragged its feet. Concrete moves like Enbridge’s latest project could reinforce the sector’s outlook if oil prices hold up, especially with year-end in sight.

The bigger picture: Pipeline investments reinforce North American energy ties.

Enbridge’s hefty investment reflects a bet that US refineries will keep snapping up Canadian crude, even as climate goals gain ground elsewhere. Expanding pipeline capacity shows how firms are adjusting to global shifts in supply and demand, particularly with US oil production and exports near their peaks. Infrastructure is likely to stay in the limelight as energy security and North American partnerships remain top of mind for both industry and policymakers.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3506095_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=43ab98e57b7e13fc246951ed38b296f7,N,,2025-11-15 14:00:02.087158

The $207 million headquarters will receive a $51 million subsidy from North Carolina economic investment funds approved this week, the Charlotte Business Journal reported. Local governments will contribute $20 million more.

That package helped win over the Volkswagen-owned startup, which is reviving the iconic Scout off-road brand as electric vehicles with a 2027 launch of its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV.

The company’s 150,000-square-foot HQ will anchor Commonwealth, at 1710 Commonwealth Drive, a 12-acre mixed-use project by Nuveen and Crosland Southeast. The development has a 150,000-square-foot “hospitality-driven” office building, 100,000 square feet of retail and 383 apartments. Scout will take temporary space while its space is built out in the recently finished office mid-rise. A second office building is planned, with Scout likely to take additional space.

CEO Scott Keogh told the outlet that Charlotte gives Scout the talent pipeline and quality-of-life pitch it needs as it rapidly scales. The company has committed to 1,200 jobs averaging $172,000 in total compensation as part of the incentives agreement.

Commonwealth’s mix of adaptive reuse, neighborhood-scale retail and modern workspace helped seal the deal, Keogh said. Plaza Midwood’s energy aligns with the brand’s outdoorsy ethos, he said.

Plaza Midwood, about 3 miles east of downtown Charlotte, was developed as a “streetcar suburb” in the early 1900s and has experienced explosive growth in recent years.

The headquarters move follows major progress on Scout’s $2 billion EV manufacturing plant rising across state lines in Blythewood, near Columbia, South Carolina.

That facility — incentivized with a $1.3 billion package in 2023 — will employ up to 4,000 workers and eventually produce 200,000 vehicles annually. Scout recently added a $300 million supplier hub there with no additional incentives. Having the HQ just 90 minutes up Interstate 77 tightens the loop between engineering, design and production.

Scout’s expansion plays into a growing Carolinas auto corridor. South Carolina has long been home to BMW and Mercedes-Benz plants, while North Carolina has finally broken through with Toyota’s multibillion-dollar EV battery campus in the Triad. VinFast’s $4 billion plant remains delayed, but Scout sees an upside long-term. Keogh said Scout is looking to create careers, not gigs.

LCV ACTION FUND ENDORSES SHERROD BROWN FOR U.S. SENATE: LCV Action Fund announced its endorsement of former Senator Sherrod Brown for election to the U.S. Senate representing Ohio. Brown has played a key leadership role in passing clean energy and climate legislation, and will advocate for creating good-paying, family-sustaining, union clean energy jobs in Ohio and bringing down costs for families across the state.

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Vice President of Political Affairs Craig Auster said, “It is critical to have strong clean energy champions like Sherrod Brown in the Senate to protect people and the planet while Trump’s government shutdown and attacks on cheap, fast clean energy is continuing to raise utility costs for families across the country. Sherrod Brown has the experience and proven leadership Ohioans can count on — he will never stop fighting for a clean energy future that helps workers and working families, rebuilds the middle class and brings down costs for everyone.”

PENNSYLVANIA PULLS OUT OF REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE: Governor Josh Shapiro announced the Pennsylvania state budget, which includes exiting the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The decision is a significant setback that will result in a loss of over $1 billion in investments for clean energy that support lowering electricity prices.

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “The state budget Governor Shapiro announced today represents a devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy and pollution by walking away from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative without establishing an alternative approach. Pennsylvanians should not have to choose between critical social services and lower energy bills — and Governor Shapiro and legislative Democrats should have held the line and rejected that false choice. Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy.

“This decision is even more stunning as it comes a week after Democrats across the nation, including in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, achieved record electoral victories by promising to combat skyrocketing energy costs. Policies like an end to utility rate hikes in New Jersey and a commitment to rejoin RGGI in Virginia resonated powerfully with voters. Rather than using these victories as momentum for ongoing negotiations, Governor Shapiro surrendered our most powerful tool to lower energy costs.

“We appreciate that House Democrats successfully secured continued funding for the Solar for Schools program, a win environmental and labor groups have worked hard for over the last few years. Unfortunately, this win does not come close to providing the level or breadth of annual clean energy investments Pennsylvania would have secured from RGGI. Moving forward, Pennsylvania’s working families deserve a laser-like focus on implementing common sense solutions for a clean energy agenda that lowers their electric bills. As Governor Shapiro himself has said about the transition to clean energy, ‘Doing nothing is not an option.’”

According to BRITE’s board chair Michael Stacey, “We are confident that under Jade’s guidance, BRITE will continue to accelerate the advanced energy economy and solidify the Midwest as a national leader in innovation.” Davis will have his work cut out for him as he succeeds Rick Stockburger who transformed the fledgling energy incubator into a respected national clean-energy enterprise that has supported more than 650 advanced energy companies, secured over a billion dollars in third-party investment and created over 2,100 jobs.

ORCHID: To the Grand Resort of Howland for earning this year’s Distinguished Golf Destination Award with exceptional status from BoardRoom magazine in partnership with Forbes Travel Guide. That merit-based designation recognizes exceptional golf courses throughout the nation that exceed expectations in the quality of service and amenities, facilities and the teamwork of the staff and management. The recognition comes on top of the expansive facility’s accolades this summer from U.S. News & World Report. That publication ranked the Grand Resort the No. 1 resort in Ohio. Given the tourist spot’s many luxurious amenities and a recent $1 million upgrade to the property, we look for such prestigious accolades to keep rolling on in.

ONION: To those irresponsible and reckless drivers who continue to operate vehicles while distracted by cellphone talking or texting as well as any other preoccupation that keeps their eyes and minds completely on the road. Such distractions can prove deadly, as indicated in the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s initial report on the crash that killed a Canfield trooper last month. According to the OSHP, Ohio has recorded 57,824 distracted driving crashes since 2020, of which 1,757 caused fatal or serious injuries. Such gross indiscretion also rises as a serious problem in the Mahoning Valley as the OSHP has made 2,268 citations for distracted driving here since the beginning of this year alone. Clearly the patrol and other law enforcement agencies have their work cut out for them, and we urge aggressive enforcement of the state’s tougher distracted driving laws that can result in fines up to $500, four points on your license and a 90-day driver’s license suspension.

ORCHID: To Kimberly Garrett for her recent appointment as executive director of the Warren-Trumbull County Public Library system. She brings to the leadership post a wealth of hands-on experience and knowledge as deputy director of the WTCPL, director of the Kinsman Library and a manager of the McKinley Memorial Library in Niles. She also has served as president of the Northeast Ohio Regional Library System Board of Trustees and has a master’s degree in library science. With such an impressive background, we’re confident she will continue the library’s noble tradition of continued growth and expanded community services.

ORCHID: To Champion High School English teacher James Sheldon for guiding his 11th- and 12th-grade English classes through a project of tangible and beneficial community service. His “Make A Difference” project has its roots in a lecture by a Carnegie-Mellon University professor on the importance of achieving dreams through helping others. This year, the students tackled such initiatives as collecting cereal donations for the Warren Family Mission, donating blankets, food and other items to the Animal Welfare League and mowing the lawns of elderly neighbors. In doing so, the students lived up to Sheldon’s lofty goal of truly making a positive difference in the lives of others.

ONION: To Newton Falls Village officials and council members who supported an original plan that could have thwarted a legitimate voter referendum on the use of unstaffed speed cameras in that community. The lawmaking body had planned to consider an ordinance last week to approve the immediate use of speed cameras that would have upstaged the citizen referendum approved for the 2026 ballot. Fortunately the proposed ordinance has been tabled. But given our longstanding opposition to the use of such cameras, we share the anger of 2nd Ward Councilman Brian Axiotis: “I was appalled that it was even on the agenda in the first place. These people went out of their way and got signatures so they had the ability to referendum this and vote on this themselves. … That strikes me as shady and terrible.”

ORCHID: To Meijer store workers at its Mahoning Valley locations for giving back generously to their communities via the Meijer Team Gives program. Thanks to the corporation’s commitment to community engagement, each store receives $10,000 to distribute to nonprofits chosen by that store’s employees. Local recipients this year included Every Dog Matters, a dog rescue organization; the Brightside Project in Salem and the Howland Local School District’s Tiger Backpack Program.

But if all work together toward the common goal, then the Voltage Valley moniker the Mahoning Valley has earned over the past five years will remain fully charged for the long haul.","General Motors’ recent announcement of massive layoffs at Ultium Cells in Lordstown hit the Mahoning Valley like a ton of bricks.

For some, it rekindled a sense of perverse deja vu, harkening back to the series of GM layoffs that began about 10 years ago and ended in 2019 with the moth-balling of the once-sprawling 13,000-employee vehicle assembly plant in the village.

That’s understandable. The announcement two weeks ago that GM will permanently lay off 440 hourly workers and temporarily release an additional 850 workers at its local Ultium Cells plant beginning Jan. 5 stands as the largest set of job losses from one company in the Mahoning Valley in several years.

But, unlike the chain reaction of job shrinkage at the Lordstown assembly plant that began a decade ago, this time around, all is not necessarily doom and gloom for the road ahead.

While we are disheartened over this jolt to our ever-evolving Voltage Valley and saddened over its impact on affected workers, plenty of room for optimism exists toward a viable rebound.

But that rebound will not come easily or quickly enough for many. Such a recovery also will require cooperation and commitments from all stakeholders in the future viability of GM in particular and electric-vehicle commerce in general for our region.

As most know by now, the downsizing and temporary closing of Ultium stems from a massive decline in EV sales after this summer’s Big Beautiful Bill scrubbed $7,500 tax credits on new EV purchases and weakened mandated fuel-economy levels. With the loss of those incentives, EV sales have plummeted 74% from their 2025 peak, according to data from analytics platform Cloud Theory.

To reverse that trajectory, the automaker and its workforce, represented by Local 1112 of the United Auto Workers, face a daunting challenge. They must prove they can make their product line succeed without artificial stimuli via federal tax credits and other public-sector incentives.

Given the current political climate in Washington, hopes for any resurrection of such generous government-funded incentives appear slim to none. That’s why any upturn in electric vehicle production and the batteries that charge them must originate with the company itself and its able workforce.

So far, the signs of such progress are encouraging.

GM CEO Mary Barra has vowed to do everything possible to reverse the current EV sales slide. “We will continue to invest in new battery chemistries, form factors and architectural improvements to drive profitability,” she said in a letter to shareholders.

Part of that investment will feature major upgrades to Ultium’s plants here and in Tennessee during the down time early next year so that when the plants reopen next spring or summer, they will be primed to produce more efficient and less costly product lines.

As for batteries, GM plans to dump the Ultium Cells one-size-fits-all brand and replace it with a series of batteries tailor-made for specific vehicles. New state-of-the-art batteries, such as the lithium manganese-rich battery cells under development in Warren, Michigan, are designed to give EV drivers a faster charge and longer-distance range.

As for the company’s unionized workforce, cooperation — not contentiousness — must be the watchword to achieve mutually desired goals. That means all traces of antagonistic relationships between the union and the company must be placed in the rearview mirror.

At this early stage, signs of such cooperation look promising.

UAW Local 1112 President George Goranitis said the union is actively discussing with the company opportunities to attract new product lines to the sprawling 2.8 million-square-foot production facility in the Valley.

In addition to the company and its employees, others will have roles to play to accelerate any EV resurgence.

The state of Ohio and private companies should prioritize fast-tracking plans to blanket the state with conveniently located charging stations. After all, the fear of batteries conking out mid-trip fuel many would-be EV buyers’ apprehension of making the leap to clean-energy cars, trucks and SUVs.

Dealers could also play a role in jumpstarting EV sales by taking a page from the playbook of those that are offering discounts and rebates on EV purchases and leases to make them comparable or less than the cost of the gas-guzzling varieties.

Broader communitywide investment in the recovery of the EV market also could contribute to success. The Drive It Home campaign, a coalition of business, labor and elected leaders who came together to urge General Motors to reinvest in the GM Lordstown Cruze plant and later succeeded in landing Foxconn at the site, could be reactivated to advocate for continued investment here and to assist the company and its workforce toward that end.

Clearly the road ahead will be paved with struggles and potential setbacks. But if all work together toward the common goal, then the Voltage Valley moniker the Mahoning Valley has earned over the past five years will remain fully charged for the long haul.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.tribtoday.com/images/2016/10/11191558/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 00:58:13.969650

The resource suite includes an introductory ESA 101 presentation and a series of short instructional videos that help explain how to determine if any runoff and spray drift requirements need to be met, as well as how to use the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) online compliance tools — Bulletins Live! Two and the Pesticide App for Label Mitigations (PALM).

“Our industry is committed to protecting endangered species and the ecosystems we all rely on,” said Alexandra Dunn, President and CEO of CLA. “By offering clear and practical resources for pesticide label compliance, we are showing our continued support for farmers and applicators. They need to have access to weed, pest, and disease control technologies for maintaining productivity, responsibly and sustainably.”

Federal agencies have long debated how to evaluate the impacts of pesticide use on endangered species under both the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the ESA, leading to EPA’s ESA Workplan. As EPA begins phasing in label language, CLA, ARA, and CPDA have joined together to support awareness and practical compliance across the pesticide supply chain.

“Understanding how ESA provisions will change pesticide label requirements is essential for retailers and applicators,” said Daren Coppock, President and CEO of ARA. “Working together, we can help ensure that everyone in the chain understands the changes and how to comply with them. We appreciate EPA’s efforts to provide clarity while maintaining flexibility and compliance with the law.”

The instructional videos are moderated by Dr. Stanley Culpepper, a leading weed science specialist with the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension, are designed to help provide field-ready guidance that supports pesticide use while protecting endangered species and their habitats.

“Growers are committed to doing things the right way, and that includes protecting endangered species,” said Terry Kippley, President and CEO of CPDA. “By using Drift Reduction Adjuvants and taking advantage of these new resources, farmers can meet ESA requirements with confidence while maintaining productivity in the field.”

However, recent administrative actions have placed the program—and millions of Americans who depend on it at risk.

Earlier this year, the Administration’s FY26 Budget Request proposed eliminating LIHEAP entirely, while reports in April indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had dismissed all LIHEAP staff. These decisions have created confusion and delay, leaving it unclear who will approve state energy assistance plans or oversee disbursement of funds now that the Continuing Resolution has been enacted.

The lawmakers noted that LIHEAP is already an underfunded and oversubscribed program—reaching only about 17 percent of eligible households. Without swift action to release funds, millions of seniors and families could be left without critical energy assistance until early 2026.

Key Impacts of Delayed LIHEAP Funding:

Families face dangerous exposure to freezing winter temperatures and life-threatening summer heat.

Rising electricity and heating costs are straining household budgets, particularly in rural and low-income communities.

Administrative delays at HHS threaten to postpone LIHEAP disbursements by months.

“Providing reliable LIHEAP funding is not a political choice, it is a moral and public health imperative,” Ruiz concluded. “We must act now to protect the most vulnerable families before temperatures drop, and lives are put at risk.”

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative represents a pragmatic approach to domestic critical mineral development that acknowledges economic realities whilst pursuing strategic objectives.","Understanding Indiana's Strategic Coal Waste Initiative

Indiana has emerged as a pioneering state in the quest to transform environmental liabilities into strategic resources through its ambitious Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction program. Governor Mike Braun's administration has established a comprehensive framework targeting the recovery of critical minerals from approximately 1,900 abandoned mining locations scattered across the state's coal belt.

The initiative centres on extracting rare earth elements from various types of coal mining byproducts, including coal gob (coarse mining refuse), processing slurry containing fine materials, and acidic mine drainage deposits. This strategic pivot aligns with federal encouragement from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Office of Surface Mining, which have explicitly positioned Indiana as a testing ground for domestic rare earth supply chain development.

The programme represents more than just mineral recovery; it embodies a paradigm shift where historical mining liabilities become potential assets in America's critical minerals energy security strategy. By targeting unconsolidated materials that contain trace concentrations of yttrium, rubidium, and other strategic elements, Indiana aims to demonstrate that coal-producing regions can contribute meaningfully to national security objectives.

Assessing the Scale of Available Coal Waste Resources

Indiana's coal waste inventory presents a substantial foundation for Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction efforts, though the true commercial potential remains under evaluation. The state's abandoned mine sites contain diverse materials accumulated over decades of coal production, including fine coal refuse, coal ash deposits, and various processing residues.

Regional Distribution Analysis:

• Southwestern Indiana: Concentrates the majority of historical coal operations and associated waste materials

• West-central regions: Contains significant coal ash deposits from power generation facilities

• Northwestern areas: Features processing slurry deposits from historical coal preparation plants

• Scattered sites: Distributed across 1,900 documented locations requiring individual assessment

The materials targeted for extraction include coal gob piles containing coarse refuse materials, fine coal processing slurry with potentially higher rare earth concentrations, and acidic mine drainage deposits where leaching processes may have concentrated certain elements. Each material type presents unique extraction challenges and opportunities based on its geochemical composition and physical characteristics.

Coal ash represents a particularly interesting component of Indiana's inventory, as power plant combustion can concentrate rare earth elements that were originally dispersed throughout coal seams. These deposits often contain measurable concentrations of light rare earth elements, though recovery methods remain largely experimental.

Commercial Viability Assessment: Grade Reality Check

The fundamental challenge facing Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction lies in the extremely low concentrations of target elements compared to traditional mining operations. Current assessments indicate approximately 10 grams of yttrium per cubic yard in typical coal waste materials, representing concentrations far below conventional commercial thresholds.

Grade Comparison Framework:

Source Type Typical Concentration Commercial Status Chinese Ion-Adsorption Clays 500-2,000 ppm REO Actively mined Hard-Rock Monazite 50,000+ ppm REO Primary REE source Indiana Coal Waste 100-300 ppm REO Pre-commercial Carbonatite Deposits 2,000-8,000 ppm REO Established operations

This grade differential represents a critical economic hurdle. While traditional ion-adsorption clay operations in China's southern provinces extract rare earth elements from deposits containing 500 to 2,000 parts per million total rare earth oxides, Indiana's coal waste typically registers between 100 and 300 ppm according to preliminary assessments.

The concentration gap becomes even more pronounced when compared to hard-rock rare earth operations like Mountain Pass in California, where monazite deposits contain 50,000 to 100,000 parts per million rare earth oxides. This means Indiana's coal waste contains roughly 1/500th the concentration of elements found in commercially viable hard-rock deposits.

Converting the reported 10 grams of yttrium per cubic yard to standard industry measurements yields approximately 13 parts per million, which falls dramatically short of the general industry benchmark of 1,000 ppm total rare earth oxides for standalone commercial viability.

Emerging Processing Technologies for Low-Grade Materials

Despite the grade challenges, several innovative processing methodologies show potential for extracting rare earth elements from Indiana's low-grade coal waste materials. These technologies focus on maximising recovery efficiency while minimising processing costs through novel approaches that align with sustainable mining practices.

Bioleaching Applications

Biological extraction methods utilise specialised bacteria to dissolve rare earth elements from complex coal matrices. This approach offers several advantages over traditional chemical processing:

• Environmental sustainability: Reduces reliance on harsh chemical reagents

• Selective extraction: Bacteria can target specific elements whilst leaving unwanted materials

• Lower energy requirements: Operates at ambient temperatures and pressures

• Scalability potential: Can process large volumes of low-grade feedstock

Research institutions are exploring bacteria species including Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans for their ability to mobilise rare earth elements from coal ash and processing residues. While still in pilot-stage development, bioleaching represents a potentially transformative approach for coal waste valorisation.

Ion-Exchange Recovery Systems

Ion-exchange technology offers another pathway for processing large volumes of low-grade coal waste materials. This methodology employs specialised resins to selectively capture and concentrate target elements:

• Selective separation: Resins can target specific rare earth elements

• Continuous processing: Allows for automated, high-throughput operations

• Minimal infrastructure: Requires less capital investment than conventional mining

• Regenerative capability: Resins can be reused multiple times

The technology builds upon established industrial processes used in water treatment and metal recovery operations. Specialised resins designed for rare earth applications show promise for concentrating elements from dilute solutions created by leaching coal waste materials.

Hybrid Chemical Processing

Integrated processing approaches combine multiple extraction techniques to enhance overall recovery rates whilst optimising costs. These hybrid systems can adapt to the specific mineral compositions found in different types of Indiana coal waste:

• Multi-stage processing: Combines acid leaching, ion-exchange, and precipitation

• Waste stream optimisation: Maximises utilisation of all process inputs

• Adaptive workflows: Can adjust to varying feedstock characteristics

• Cost efficiency: Reduces overall processing expenses through integration

Federal Support and National Security Alignment

Federal backing represents a critical component enabling Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative. The strategic alignment between state objectives and national security priorities creates funding mechanisms that could make otherwise uneconomic projects financially viable through industry innovation trends.

The U.S. Department of Energy and Office of Surface Mining have positioned Indiana as their preferred testing ground for domestic rare earth development technologies. This federal endorsement provides access to research funding, technical expertise, and regulatory support necessary for advancing extraction methodologies.

Key Federal Programmes Supporting the Initiative:

• Critical Materials Research Programmes: DOE funding for innovative extraction technologies

• Mine Reclamation Grants: Federal funding for environmental remediation with REE recovery components

• USGS Technical Support: Geological expertise and resource assessment capabilities

• National Defense Authorization: Strategic minerals research and development funding

The alignment addresses multiple policy objectives simultaneously: environmental remediation of abandoned mine sites, domestic critical minerals production, and reduced dependence on foreign rare earth suppliers. This multi-faceted approach enables funding streams that wouldn't support standalone mining operations.

Economic Model: Reclamation-Integrated Approach

Indiana's economic strategy cleverly repositions rare earth extraction as a secondary benefit of federally mandated environmental reclamation activities. Rather than pursuing traditional mining economics, the state treats REE recovery as value-added outcomes from necessary cleanup operations, incorporating mine reclamation innovations throughout the process.

Three-Tier Economic Structure:

Primary Objective: Environmental remediation of abandoned mine sites using federal reclamation funding

Secondary Benefit: Rare earth element recovery to offset cleanup costs and generate modest revenues

Tertiary Value: Technology development and export potential for other coal-producing regions

This approach circumvents traditional mining economics by leveraging environmental compliance requirements to subsidise extraction research and development. Federal reclamation grants effectively cover the base costs of site preparation, material handling, and initial processing infrastructure.

The model acknowledges that standalone REE extraction from Indiana's low-grade materials cannot compete with Chinese production costs or established hard-rock operations. However, when integrated with mandatory environmental cleanup activities, the combined value proposition becomes economically attractive.

Corporate and Research Institution Involvement

Several companies have established operations targeting coal waste rare earth extraction across the broader Appalachian and Midwest regions, with Indiana representing a significant expansion opportunity. These operations typically focus on processing capacities ranging from several hundred to several thousand metric tons annually.

The corporate landscape includes both established mining companies diversifying into coal waste processing and specialised startups developing novel extraction technologies. Companies are attracted to Indiana's initiative due to federal funding availability, regulatory support, and abundant feedstock materials.

Research Institution Partnerships:

• Indiana Geological and Water Survey: Leading state-level geological assessment and resource mapping

• Purdue University: Materials science and chemical engineering research support

• Indiana University: Geochemistry and environmental impact assessment studies

• Regional Collaborations: Multi-state geological surveys sharing data and methodologies

These partnerships leverage federal Department of Energy funding for three-year evaluation projects designed to demonstrate technical feasibility and economic potential. The collaborative approach pools expertise and resources whilst reducing individual institutional risks.

Global Context: International Coal Waste REE Programmes

Indiana's initiative operates within a broader international context of coal waste valorisation programmes, each addressing unique local conditions and strategic objectives. This global perspective provides valuable insights for feasibility study insights development.

International Comparison Framework:

Region Development Stage Key Advantages Primary Focus Indiana, USA Pilot/Early Commercial Federal funding support Integrated reclamation Appalachian Region Commercial operations Established supply chains Industrial-scale processing European Union Research-focused Advanced processing tech Environmental compliance Australia Exploration-stage High-grade coal waste Export potential

The Appalachian region has achieved more advanced commercial deployment, with several facilities processing coal waste at industrial scales. These operations provide valuable precedents for Indiana's programme whilst highlighting both opportunities and challenges in scaling extraction operations.

European Union coal waste programmes emphasise research and development of environmentally sustainable processing technologies, often with stronger regulatory frameworks and higher environmental standards. Australia's coal waste REE exploration benefits from higher-grade deposits but faces greater distances to processing facilities and export markets.

Environmental Benefits and Processing Considerations

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction offers significant environmental advantages beyond mineral recovery, addressing long-standing ecological and public health concerns associated with abandoned mine sites. The National Academies report emphasises the potential for transforming environmental liabilities into productive assets.

Primary Environmental Outcomes:

• Acid Mine Drainage Remediation: Processing neutralises acidic water contamination affecting local watersheds

• Land Reclamation: Converts abandoned industrial sites into productive or recreational land uses

• Waste Volume Reduction: Significantly reduces coal waste pile volumes through processing

• Groundwater Protection: Eliminates ongoing leaching from unmanaged waste deposits

Modern extraction techniques prioritise environmental sustainability through closed-loop water systems that prevent contamination of local water resources. Processing facilities employ selective chemical processes designed to minimise reagent consumption and waste generation.

The integration of rare earth extraction with environmental remediation creates positive feedback loops where mineral recovery helps fund more comprehensive cleanup activities than would be economically feasible through reclamation grants alone.

Processing Infrastructure Requirements

Successful implementation requires specialised processing infrastructure adapted to coal waste characteristics:

• Materials handling systems: Capable of processing heterogeneous coal waste feedstocks

• Chemical processing facilities: Equipped for selective rare earth extraction and purification

• Water treatment systems: Managing both process water and acid mine drainage

• Quality control laboratories: Ensuring product specifications meet industrial standards

Technical and Market Development Challenges

Despite promising technological developments and federal support, Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction faces substantial technical and market challenges that must be addressed for commercial success.

Primary Technical Hurdles

Low Concentration Economics represent the most significant obstacle to commercial viability. Processing enormous volumes of coal waste to achieve meaningful rare earth output creates transportation, handling, and processing cost challenges that compound with scale.

Current extraction technologies achieve limited recovery efficiency from coal waste matrices, often capturing less than 50% of available rare earth content. Improving recovery rates requires continued technology development and optimisation for specific coal waste compositions.

Processing Complexity stems from coal waste containing diverse mineral matrices that require specialised separation techniques. Unlike traditional rare earth ores with predictable mineralogy, coal waste presents variable compositions that complicate standardised processing approaches.

Quality control for end-product specifications remains challenging when processing heterogeneous feedstocks. Industrial customers require consistent rare earth purity levels and elemental ratios that are difficult to achieve from variable coal waste inputs.

Market Development Requirements

Supply Chain Integration represents a critical success factor requiring development of downstream processing capabilities. Indiana's initiative must establish connections to facilities capable of converting rare earth concentrates into finished products for electronics, renewable energy, and defence applications.

Logistics networks require establishment for consistent delivery schedules and quality specifications. Industrial customers need reliable supply chains with predictable pricing and delivery terms that coal waste operations must demonstrate over extended periods.

Market Positioning Challenges:

• Price competition: Must compete with established Chinese and other international suppliers

• Volume limitations: Cannot match scale of traditional mining operations

• Quality consistency: Must demonstrate reliable product specifications

• Customer development: Building relationships with downstream industrial users

Implementation Timeline and Success Metrics

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction programme follows a phased implementation approach designed to demonstrate technical feasibility whilst building toward commercial viability.

Short-Term Objectives (2025-2027)

The initial phase focuses on establishing pilot-scale operations at selected abandoned mine sites across Indiana's coal belt. These demonstration projects will test various extraction technologies under real-world conditions whilst generating data on processing costs and recovery rates.

Phase One Milestones:

• Site Selection: Identify 3-5 abandoned mine locations with optimal coal waste characteristics

• Technology Validation: Demonstrate bioleaching and ion-exchange methods at pilot scale

• Regulatory Approval: Secure necessary permits for processing operations

• Funding Security: Obtain federal grants for expanded reclamation-integrated projects

• Partnership Development: Establish relationships with downstream processing facilities

Federal funding represents a critical enabler for initial operations, with grants from the Department of Energy and Office of Surface Mining providing essential capital for pilot project development. These funding sources reduce private sector risk whilst demonstrating government commitment to domestic rare earth development.

Long-Term Vision (2028-2035)

The expansion phase envisions scaling successful pilot operations to process substantial volumes of coal waste whilst establishing Indiana as a regional centre for critical mineral processing.

Strategic Development Goals:

• Production Scaling: Process 10,000+ tons of coal waste annually across multiple facilities

• Economic Viability: Achieve cost-competitive rare earth element production through process optimisation

• Technology Transfer: Export proven extraction methodologies to other coal-producing states

• Regional Hub Development: Establish downstream processing capabilities for value-added products

Success depends on achieving cost reductions through technological improvements, scale economies, and continued integration with federally funded environmental remediation programmes. The long-term vision positions Indiana as a testing ground for technologies that could be replicated across coal-producing regions nationwide.

Investment Risk Assessment and Strategic Implications

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction presents a complex investment proposition requiring careful evaluation of technical, economic, and strategic risk factors.

High-Risk Factors

Unproven commercial economics represent the primary investment risk, as current extraction costs exceed potential revenues at prevailing rare earth prices. The integration with federal reclamation funding provides crucial subsidies, but long-term viability requires either significant cost reductions or sustained government support.

Technology development uncertainties create additional risk as bioleaching and specialised ion-exchange processes remain largely experimental for coal waste applications. Scaling laboratory successes to industrial operations often encounters unforeseen technical challenges and cost escalations.

Regulatory approval processes for coal waste processing operations involve multiple agencies and environmental impact assessments that could delay or prevent project implementation. Changing federal priorities or reduced funding for reclamation programmes could significantly impact project economics.

Strategic Investment Advantages

Domestic supply chain security benefits provide strategic value beyond traditional financial returns. Companies and government agencies increasingly prioritise domestic rare earth sources to reduce dependence on Chinese suppliers and enhance supply chain resilience.

The environmental value proposition offers additional investment rationale through environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria that many institutional investors prioritise. Projects that simultaneously address environmental remediation and critical mineral production align with sustainable investment themes.

Technology development potential creates intellectual property and export opportunities that could generate returns beyond initial rare earth production. Successful coal waste extraction technologies could be licensed to other regions or countries facing similar challenges.

Market Psychology and Investor Positioning

Early-stage positioning allows investors to participate in potential breakthrough technologies before commercial validation reduces investment risks and returns. The federal government backing provides credibility and reduces regulatory uncertainties that typically complicate early-stage resource projects.

Investment interest should focus on companies with strong technical teams, federal funding relationships, and realistic development timelines. Speculative claims about massive resource values should be evaluated sceptically against demonstrated extraction capabilities and processing costs.

The market psychology around domestic rare earth production often involves significant hype cycles that can create investment opportunities and risks. Successful investors will distinguish between genuine technological progress and promotional claims unsupported by economic fundamentals.

Industry Context and Future Outlook

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative operates within broader industry trends toward supply chain diversification and critical mineral security. The programme's success could establish replicable models for coal-producing regions nationwide whilst advancing American strategic mineral independence.

The innovation hub potential extends beyond immediate rare earth production to encompass research and development capabilities that could benefit multiple critical mineral sectors. Universities, national laboratories, and private companies collaborating in Indiana could generate technologies applicable to other domestic mineral resources.

Global competitive positioning remains challenging given China's integrated rare earth supply chains and cost advantages. However, Indiana's programme targets specific market segments where domestic sourcing provides strategic value despite higher costs, particularly for defence and critical infrastructure applications.

The integration of environmental remediation with mineral extraction represents an innovative business model that could influence policy and investment approaches in other resource sectors. Success in Indiana could encourage similar programmes for mining waste streams containing critical minerals.

Long-Term Strategic Implications

The transformation of environmental liabilities into strategic assets aligns with broader trends in sustainable resource development and circular economy principles. Indiana's initiative demonstrates how historical industrial activities can provide feedstock for future critical mineral needs.

Federal support for coal waste rare earth extraction reflects broader policy priorities emphasising domestic critical mineral production and supply chain resilience. Continued bipartisan support for these objectives provides a favourable policy environment for programme expansion.

Technology development in Indiana could position American companies as leaders in low-grade rare earth extraction, creating export opportunities and competitive advantages in global critical mineral markets. The expertise gained from coal waste processing could apply to other unconventional rare earth sources worldwide.

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative represents a pragmatic approach to domestic critical mineral development that acknowledges economic realities whilst pursuing strategic objectives. While immediate commercial returns remain uncertain, the programme's alignment with federal priorities and environmental benefits creates a foundation for sustained development and potential breakthrough achievements in American rare earth production capabilities.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

Energy efficiency can improve grid stability Expanding efficiency programs that reduce demand and improve grid stability is common sense, not partisanship.","Arizona’s technology economy is thriving, powered by innovation, growth and a shared commitment to building a more resilient future. However, this progress is now at risk.

The Arizona Corporation Commission’s ongoing effort to repeal the state’s Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST) and Energy Efficiency (EE) rules threatens to undo bipartisan, pro-business energy leadership that has strengthened Arizona’s economy and increased Arizona’s grid reliability.

The ACC’s stated goal is to cut costs and preserve reliability. Repealing these standards will do the opposite. It will inject uncertainty into Arizona’s energy future, weaken the competitive advantage that clean technology brings and ultimately drive higher costs.

Adopted in 2006, the REST rules established a clear framework for utilities to gradually increase the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. The EE rules adopted in 2010 require utilities to help customers reduce energy use and peak demand through rebates and technology upgrades.

Together, these policies have been among the most successful, pro-growth energy tools Arizona has implemented. They have attracted billions in private investment, created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and helped utilities avoid building expensive power plants, which translates into lower electric bills.

Across the state, companies are investing in advanced manufacturing and clean technology facilities that depend on affordable, reliable and increasingly renewable power. These investments have spurred job growth in both urban and rural communities, strengthened our supply chains and helped make Arizona one of the top states for clean energy manufacturing.

Energy efficiency remains the most cost-effective way to meet Arizona’s growing energy demand. According to The World Bank, for every dollar invested, consumers and businesses have seen nearly $4 in returns through lower utility bills and avoided infrastructure costs.

Energy efficiency can improve grid stability

Expanding efficiency programs that reduce demand and improve grid stability is common sense, not partisanship. Every megawatt saved through smarter energy use is a megawatt that doesn’t have to be generated, transmitted, or paid for by consumers.

Opponents of the REST and EE rules argue Arizona already has “met its goals” and utilities now voluntarily pursue clean energy targets, making the rules unnecessary. Voluntary goals can change overnight, however, and utilities may decide to walk back their clean energy commitments. Without a clear, consistent policy framework, there’s no guarantee that private investment in renewables and efficiency will continue at the pace our growing economy demands.

Some also claim the rules have “cost ratepayers billions.” That may have been true 15 years ago when early solar projects were expensive. But the point of policy is to drive progress, and it worked. Solar and wind prices have fallen by more than 80% since those early investments. Repealing the rules now would cut off the very progress that made clean energy affordable in the first place.

And while critics point to Arizona’s dust storms as proof that solar is unreliable, that’s exactly why we have a diversified energy mix. When gas or nuclear plants supplement renewables during peak demand, that’s not failure. That’s a well-designed system doing its job.

Repealing rules sends the wrong signal

The Arizona Technology Council represents more than 750 science and technology companies statewide, from innovative startups to Fortune 500 firms. Many support and depend on clean, renewable energy to power advanced manufacturing and data operations. These companies choose Arizona because our state has historically embraced an “all-of-the-above” approach: practical, balanced and forward-looking.

Repealing these rules would send the wrong signal to employers and investors at a time when other states are doubling down on clean technology and grid modernization. It would undercut Arizona’s leadership in industries like solar manufacturing, battery storage and high-tech construction, industries that bring quality jobs and long-term economic value.

The ACC should not pick winners and losers but provide stability, predictability and fairness. The REST and EE standards do exactly that.

If the ACC wants reform, let’s reform. But reform should mean modernizing standards and rules, not repealing them altogether. Let’s update the rules to reflect today’s technology and give utilities flexibility to meet them. Let’s continue to expand efficiency programs that save money and strengthen reliability. And let’s keep the policies that have made Arizona a national leader in energy innovation.

The Council urges the ACC to keep the REST and EE standards in place and build upon their proven success. Our future depends on it.

Jones publishes two papers on associations between intimate partner violence and non-communicable conditions

Brooke Jones, doctoral student in the Department of Maternal and Child Health, has published two papers in BMC Public Health and the Journal of Gender-Based Violence on associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) and certain non-communicable conditions.

“Associations between IPV and non-communicable diseases – a systematic review,” published in BMC Public Health, identified consistent associations between IPV and adverse outcomes across cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease, based on findings from 39 studies. Cancer emerged as the most frequently studied condition, with 19 publications, of which 14 focused specifically on breast or gynecological cancers. In contrast, research on the other non-communicable diseases was more limited, revealing an uneven distribution of scholarly attention and underscoring important gaps for future investigation. The research highlights a growing body of evidence linking IPV with worsened outcomes for individuals living with non-communicable diseases.

“Exploring attitudes towards intimate partner violence research and intervention among people with cystic fibrosis,” published in the Journal of Gender-Based Violence, explored perspectives on IPV-related research and clinical intervention among people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) and their family members. Fifty-four individuals completed the survey. While most (59.1%) find studying IPV in CF to be either ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ important, most (61.4%) had never been screened in outpatient health care settings, suggesting a critical gap in care. Key barriers to pwCF leaving abusive relationships included financial and insurance-related dependence as well as self-esteem concerns.",https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/112/2020/12/COMM_McGavran_Greenberg_738x491.png,N,,2025-11-15 11:06:17.109992

“By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.”

The action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to “modernize resource policy in Alaska,” according to the Interior Department. In October, the department announced actions that include reopening the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing and the completion of right-of-way permits for the Ambler Road project, which would provide access to an area rich in critical metals.

Other actions to increase Alaska energy production include a land exchange to facilitate the construction of a road between King Cove and the airport at Cold Bay which will convey approximately 490 acres within the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to King Cove Corporation in exchange for 1,739 acres to be added to another part of the refuge.

The game is at 9 p.m. Friday with the Tar Heels heavily favored. So that might affect the crowd that shows up at the Smith Center.

The Eagles, now in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, are 1-3 after opening the season with a 48-point blowout loss at N.C. State followed by closer defeats at Virginia and App State.

They are coached by LeVelle Moton, in his 17th season and a former star at his alma mater, who has been honored numerous times as a player and coach for Central. He grew up in a crime-infested neighborhood in Boston until his single mother moved him and an older brother to Raleigh and a safer place to live.

He was an all-conference and all-state high school star at Sanderson, averaging 23 points as a junior and just under 30 as a senior, putting up 51 points against Cary High School before signing with Central and becoming the university’s third all-time leading scorer with the nickname “poetry in motion.”

As an honorable mention All-American at Central, he was the 1996 CIAA Player of the Year and was inducted into the NCCU Hall of Fame in 2004 as the Eagles’ career leader in 3-point field goals (213). Moton has been mentioned over the years as a candidate for several bigger jobs but has remained in Durham with his wife Bridget and raised their two children. His Velle Cares Foundation has an annual event “Single Mother Salute” and celebrates more than 100 single mothers each year across the Triangle and gives out a Single Mother of the Year Award (named for his mother Hattie McDougald).

Moton holds a career coaching record of 278-219, including eight MEAC regular season and tournament championships. The last of those titles came in 2019 and 2020 before NIL and eventually revenue share began, which has made it even more difficult for mid-major schools.

The Eagles play in the 3,500-seat McDougald-McLendon Arena. It is named for long-time Durham civic leader Richard McDougald and former NCCU coach John McLendon, who in 1944 helped organize “The Secret Game” between what was then called North Carolina College and the Duke University Medical School, which was the first fully integrated college basketball game.

Central also has a rich athletic heritage in track & field under Olympic coach Leroy Walker. The Eagles football team was coached by former UNC All-ACC lineman Rod Broadway, who later had undefeated seasons at Grambling and North Carolina A&T.

Sam Jones, who won 10 NBA championships with the Celtics as one of the greatest shooters in the game, played at Central and returned there to coach for two seasons in the 1970s. As a five-time NBA all-star, his fame and presence made the Eagles games must-attend. The gym filled up an hour before tip-off, and the drum line didn’t stop until the game was over, win or lose.

Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps.
The EV charging companies point to that as evidence that the industry cannot afford additional stumbling blocks.
And, like the others, she also bemoaned the inspection cost.
We’re only, at best, a few years into any state regulating EV chargers,” Atticks said.","Key players in the electric vehicle industry said they’re concerned that state-imposed costs to fund a new charger inspection program could suppress the budding EV industry in Maryland.

At a virtual meeting Thursday, EV companies, drivers and local government officials told the Maryland Department of Agriculture that the $150-per-port fee it will levy to pay for the cost of inspections could make it too expensive for companies or others to offer EV charging.

“This feels like such a sock in the gut to me,” said Lynn Parsons, an EV driver who testified at the hearing. “I hope I’m wrong. But for someone who has struggled to find EV charging stations, this just feels like it’s going to slow down the advancement of adding additional charging stations.”

But Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks defended the testing, which will be administered by the weights and measures division that already tests gas pumps, grocery store scales and other equipment around the state for accuracy. That division relies on fees to fund its operations, he said. And state oversight is something drivers are asking for, Atticks said.

“We heard from a number of owners and drivers of EVs about the need for not only registration, but inspection — and then inspection as a prompt for remediation,” he said.

Atticks said lawmakers gave his department the authority to levy inspection fees as part of the annual Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act this year. The department prepared the regulation, passed it to the legislature’s regulations committee and then opened a 30-day public comment period — that drew zero comments.

Some speakers at Thursday’s meeting said they felt blindsided by the news of the fees, which came in late September. They argued that the regulation was quietly ushered toward the finish line, and there wasn’t an effort to solicit robust comment from the public until Thursday’s meeting — after the regulation had already taken effect, and the department heard pushback.

Maryland joins suit against Trump administration on electric vehicles

Atticks said that the department did not directly notify any stakeholders, because the law doesn’t require it. The department followed its typical procedure for rule-making, he said.

The new policy requires that all EV chargers that offer a charge in exchange for payment be registered with the state by Jan. 1, and pay the $150 fee for each port at the station. Inspectors will begin visual checks in January, Atticks said, ensuring that chargers are registered (and affixing decals confirming that) and clearly display key information like the responsible party and the method of sale.

They’ll also tag and shut down any chargers that are inoperable, said Atticks, who recounted his own misadventures driving his state-owned electric vehicle around Maryland.

“There have been numerous examples that I have experienced where getting to a charger, the charger is not working and it is not easily possible — with the device or with the app that is associated with the device — to somehow prompt that it be refreshed,” he said. “I think over time, systems upgrade to allow that. Until we’re at that point, these inspections are going to be pretty critical.”

Sometime in the spring, he said the department hopes to begin testing the charging ports for accuracy, using a roughly $135,000 piece of equipment, known as a “standard,” that will check whether chargers are accurately tabulating the amount of electricity dispensed.

The cost of the standard is just one factor that went into the department’s decision to charge $150 per port, Atticks said. The fee also needs to cover the cost of electricity for each test session, which can take up to 30 minutes per port, garage or parking lot entry fees, travel costs and the potential need for return trips if chargers are in use.

In short, “it will take a lot” to inspect the chargers, Atticks said.

In an early October letter signed by industry heavyweights, including Tesla and Rivian, the companies asked that the fee be paused, and ultimately lowered to $25 per port. They also asked to limit the total fees levied at any one location. Their letter said other states have set fees at $20-$25 per device. Connecticut charges $50 per device, and Florida $100, but Maryland would still be top of the pack.

“Maryland’s new EV charging device registration fee — the highest in the nation — will discourage EV charging deployment, will impose additional expenses on Maryland businesses, and will further hinder the state from achieving its EV adoption commitments,” the letter reads.

But Atticks said not all those states have to fund their operations through fees, as Maryland does. And some states have realized they “underestimated the amount of time and expense that it would take to accurately inspect EV chargers, and so they are going back to adjust their fees,” he said.

Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps. That fee is not per pump but per meter, he said, and with each gas pump having between four and 10 meters, the actual cost is $80-$200 per gas pump.

The new fees will leave businesses that offer EV charging with three options, according to the EV companies’ letter: Try to eat the cost, pass the cost on to customers, or cut costs by decommissioning chargers.

The changes come as the state grapples with ambitious commitments to electric vehicles — and ambitious climate goals.

Maryland is one of several states that follow California’s emissions standards, which require an increasing share of car sales be EVs, until model year 2035, when all new cars would have to be zero-emission.

But Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order in April that allows the state to delay penalties for car manufacturers under the rule for model years 2027 and 2028. The EV charging companies point to that as evidence that the industry cannot afford additional stumbling blocks.

Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

“The State has acknowledged the market challenges facing ZEV [zero-emission vehicle] adoption; now is not the time to impose a new annual registration fee on EV chargers that is the highest such fee in the nation,” their letter said.

Parsons and others Thursday were particularly concerned that the same fee will be levied for all types of commercial chargers, whether they are DC fast chargers at highway rest stops or slower Level 2 chargers at isolated condo or apartment complexes, which typically generate considerably less revenue.

Robert Borkowski, owner of EV charging company Plug IO, which focuses on installing chargers at multi-unit dwellings, said in an interview that many charging ports at housing complexes may not break even financially, because of the new fees.

“We do not have enough EVs to offset that cost, because right now, we are still in a very early [stage] of building out the infrastructure,” said Borkowski, who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting. “There may be not enough EVs, just even to generate the revenue to cover $150 per year.”

Others ech0ed the cost concerns. Anthony Willingham, public policy manager for charging company Electrify America, argued that the new fee structure will make it harder for his company to find welcoming sites for chargers, such as gas stations.

“It just makes the idea and the product much less attractive, especially when the registration fee is much higher than it is — or then it would be — in other jurisdictions,” Willingham said.

He said his company began installing chargers in 2017, some of which are still operational today. They are faltering not because of neglect but because of high demand, said Willingham, who compared it to :putting your dishwasher in a commercial kitchen. It’s going to struggle.”

Baltimore Gas & Electric, which operates hundreds of chargers around the state, also complained during Thursday’s meeting. Utilities are already required to report to the state’s Public Service Commission on the reliability of their chargers, and are required to maintain 97% uptime, said BGE’s Stephanie Leach. Charger shutoffs by Agriculture Department inspectors could make the PSC’s uptime standard harder to reach, she said.

And, like the others, she also bemoaned the inspection cost.

“We have over 700 chargers in the ground —public chargers and then additional multifamily chargers. So we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars that will we will incur in registration fees this year,” said Leach, strategic programs manager at BGE.

Several speakers asked whether the department could cut inspection costs by inspecting less often, for example, or bypassing the expensive equipment and conducting visual inspections only.? But department staffers seemed resolute, and didn’t indicate that any changes would be made to their inspection plans.

Borkowski said he worries that condos and apartments with EV chargers that aren’t used very much will rip them out, to avoid the registration fee, or a fee for an inoperable charger. It would take a homeowners association or condo board that is “really pro EVs” to convince residents they should keep paying for costly charging stations because it’s “going to benefit you in the future,” he said.

Borkowski said he is already considering lowering the number of chargers in two upcoming projects at multi-unit complexes, because of the new fees.

Brian Booher, an EV specialist with the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, agreed with Borkowski about the risk of charger shutdowns. He said the department should focus on fast-chargers being used by travelers in need of rapid power, rather than slower chargers used by building residents who are not necessarily in a rush to find a charge.

“The issues that we’ve encountered with reliability really apply and are most frustrating when we’re trying to find that fast charging — when we need power quick and it just doesn’t work,” Booher said. “The Level 2s around the county are really often there for convenience or you need them overnight.”

Atticks said concerns with multi-unit dwellings would be “one of our priorities to take back and just consider: What is the path forward?” But he also noted that other states don’t seem to differentiate between types of chargers in their programs.

“Now, look, this is new. We’re only, at best, a few years into any state regulating EV chargers,” Atticks said. “If we can be the ones to innovate and come up with the newest, best alternative, we’ll be happy to do that.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54486116423_04fa1b1fa3_o-1024x7681763175895.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=VTVt3OFY,N,,2025-11-15 00:58:23.870440

Then Survived ...,"Haye Kesteloo, www.facebook.com, haye.kesteloo",,,,,https://evxl.co/2025/11/14/biden-5-billion-ev-charging-program/,"The problem: hardly any American factories existed to produce EV chargers that could meet those standards.
Biden’s NEVI program failed spectacularly at its visible mission—building charging stations—while succeeding at the invisible work of forcing industry standards.
Now those same charging stations are being built under Trump’s relaxed rules, and he’ll likely take credit for “fixing” a program he tried to eliminate.
NEVI’s slow rollout occurred during the exact period when federal EV subsidies were propping up demand.
NEVI will ultimately deliver thousands of charging stations using taxpayer money to solve a problem Tesla already solved profitably.","President Biden promised a national network of 500,000 EV chargers would “sprout up very quickly.” Four years later, only 25 charging locations had opened, handing Donald Trump perfect campaign ammunition to mock the program as government waste. But beneath the political disaster lies an unexpected success story: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program forced America’s fragmented charging industry to adopt common standards that are finally making EV road trips reliable—and the program survived Trump’s inauguration day freeze attempt to become operational under his own administration.

The gap between Biden’s 2021 promise and 2025 reality gave Trump one of his most effective attack lines. At the Republican National Convention, he called the federal effort a “crazy electric Band-Aid” and claimed “They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didn’t work,” according to Politico Magazine’s deep dive into the program. The numbers were exaggerated—it was actually 15 stations at that point—but Trump had identified a genuine failure that resonated with voters frustrated by slow government action.

The Promise Versus The Reality

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg set expectations in 2021 when he predicted charging stations would appear “very quickly around the country.” Congress approved $5 billion for NEVI as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, with the primary goal of building a safety net of charging stations every 50 miles along major highways.

The execution proved far more complex than anyone anticipated. States struggled with Title 23 regulations—the 818-page rulebook governing federal transportation spending—while navigating Depression-era labor requirements and Biden-era Buy America mandates requiring 55% domestic content. The problem: hardly any American factories existed to produce EV chargers that could meet those standards.

Supply chain chaos compounded delays. Getting an electrical transformer for a charging station could take three years during the pandemic recovery. State departments of transportation, experts at building roads and bridges, found themselves managing technology projects involving software, payment systems, and grid connections—skills completely outside their expertise.

The Hidden Achievement No One Noticed

While NEVI failed to deliver visible charging stations, it succeeded at something more fundamental: forcing the chaotic charging industry to get its act together.

Before NEVI, America’s charging network was fragmented chaos. Companies like EV Institute in Maryland operated stations with 50-kilowatt speeds when modern EVs needed 150kW or more. Payment systems didn’t work across networks. Reliability was abysmal—Politico reporters visiting Maryland stations found multiple locations completely non-functional, with disconnected customer service numbers and graffiti-covered chargers displaying “OUT OF ORDER” signs.

NEVI’s 35,000-word guidance document established mandatory standards for reliability, interoperability, cybersecurity, and payment systems. To access billions in federal funding, charging providers had to meet these requirements. The program essentially told the industry: “You want government money? Here are the rules everyone must follow.”

The impact extended beyond NEVI-funded stations. States and utilities began adopting the federal standards as their own requirements. What started as conditions for federal funding became industry-wide best practices.

Tesla’s Network Opened Because Of NEVI Incentives

One of NEVI’s most significant but underappreciated achievements was helping push Tesla to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla vehicles. The chance to tap NEVI funding was part of what spurred CEO Elon Musk to make the strategic shift, according to Politico’s reporting.

That decision transformed the competitive landscape. As EVXL documented in June 2025, Tesla’s Supercharger network dwarfs competitors like Electrify America, particularly along key routes. Tesla operates approximately 73,000 Supercharger stalls globally, and the network processed roughly 587,000 charging sessions per day during 2025.

The reliability gap remains stark. J.D. Power reported in May 2025 that public EV charger reliability hit 84% success rate—a notable improvement from 80% in 2021, but still highlighting the work remaining for non-Tesla networks.

Trump Tried To Kill It But Couldn’t

On inauguration day, Trump announced he would freeze NEVI along with numerous other Biden programs. But Democrats had written the program into law with such specific detail and embedded it so deeply into core federal highway spending that Trump found little room to maneuver.

The program not only survived a court challenge but was reluctantly adopted by the administration. While Trump relaxed some of the most burdensome requirements, the core mission of constructing a federal charging network endured, shielded by layers of Democratic legalisms and technicalities.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in summer 2025 that the administration would reopen funding, saying “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Duffy threw out Biden’s 35,000-word guidance document and replaced it with a brief 2,500-word version “to allow states to actually build EV chargers.” Gone were strict spacing requirements and detailed federal oversight. States gained flexibility to declare when their networks were finished.

Some EV advocates who typically opposed Trump policies found themselves praising the changes. The Electrification Coalition said it “appreciate[d] the Department’s efforts to streamline the program.”

Stations Finally Coming Online Under Trump’s Watch

With regulatory burdens reduced and states now experienced with the process, NEVI is hitting its stride. State transportation departments have wrapped their heads around charging infrastructure. Money is flowing and thousands of stations are under construction.

Analysts expect thousands of NEVI-funded chargers may be online by 2027 or 2028—exactly when the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation predicted back in 2022, though that timeline offered no political benefit to Biden.

Maryland officials say their first wave of 22 stations will be online by late 2026. Across the country, privately funded charging plazas are being built near highways without any federal assistance, suggesting NEVI’s standards have helped create conditions for market-driven expansion.

Andrew Dick of Electrify America told Politico that NEVI created “a level of consistency and cohesion that didn’t exist before,” noting that the federal rules became adopted as standard industry practice even beyond NEVI-funded projects.

EVXL’s Take

This story perfectly encapsulates the subsidy-dependent dysfunction we’ve been documenting across the EV industry. Biden’s NEVI program failed spectacularly at its visible mission—building charging stations—while succeeding at the invisible work of forcing industry standards. Then Trump killed it on principle but was forced to resurrect it because Democrats had made it legally unkillable.

The irony runs deep. Back in August 2024, we covered Trump’s wildly exaggerated claims about NEVI, noting his “$9 billion for 8 chargers” line was hyperbole but pointed to genuine failure. Now those same charging stations are being built under Trump’s relaxed rules, and he’ll likely take credit for “fixing” a program he tried to eliminate.

Here’s what nobody wants to admit: the charging infrastructure problem was always solvable through market forces if government would just get out of the way. Tesla proved this by building the world’s most reliable charging network without federal handouts. The company operates 73,000 Supercharger stalls globally that actually work, process 587,000 sessions daily, and recently opened real-time availability data to Google Maps for all EV drivers.

Meanwhile, NEVI spent four years navigating Title 23 regulations, Buy America requirements, and state bureaucracy to build 25 locations. The program’s real achievement—forcing reliability standards—could have been accomplished through simple federal mandates rather than a $5 billion spending program.

But let’s connect this to the broader collapse we’re witnessing. NEVI’s slow rollout occurred during the exact period when federal EV subsidies were propping up demand. Now that the $7,500 tax credit expired on September 30, 2025, we’re seeing the real market. As we reported last week, U.S. vehicle sales cratered in October with EV sales plunging 24% in a single month.

The timing matters. All those battery plants we documented sitting idle? The $28 billion Battery Belt collapse? That’s happening simultaneously with charging infrastructure finally coming online. We’re building the roads after the gold rush ended.

NEVI will ultimately deliver thousands of charging stations using taxpayer money to solve a problem Tesla already solved profitably. The program survived not because it was good policy, but because Democrats buried it so deep in federal spending that even a hostile administration couldn’t extract it without Congressional action. That’s not evidence of smart governance—it’s evidence of how hard it is to kill bad programs once they’re embedded in the bureaucracy.

The real lesson here isn’t about charging infrastructure. It’s about the dangers of building entire industries on government subsidies rather than actual consumer demand. When the subsidies end, demand collapses, and you’re left with empty battery plants and charging stations that finally work but serve a market that no longer exists at scale.

With carbon capture and storage poised to take American energy dominance to new heights, we were years ahead of any other state.

As the Trump administration repealed many of the Biden-era tax credits, it doubled down on support for carbon capture and storage in the One Big Beautiful Bill because the technology is viable and has a market demand.

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C. Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades.
Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

Early initiatives at the summit – particularly those linking energy access with smallholder agriculture and social protection – underscore the importance of projects that simultaneously address climate, energy and socioeconomic goals.
The implication for energy investment is clear: integrated models combining decentralized renewables, storage, agro-industrial linkages and local services are likely to deliver the greatest impact.
The Invest in African Energy (IAE) Forum, scheduled for March 30-April 1, 2026 in Paris, provides such a platform, bridging the gap between ambition and execution.
Discussions at COP30 have reinforced Africa’s dual imperative: expand universal energy access while building resilient, low-carbon systems.","The first days of COP30 in Belém have underscored Africa’s urgent energy needs, with leaders emphasizing that closing the continent’s energy-access gap is critical for both development and climate resilience. More than 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa remain without electricity, while UNEP estimates suggest that developing nations will need more than $310 billion annually by 2035 to adapt to climate-related impacts. COP30 participants have stressed that achieving energy access requires not only pledges but substantial, targeted capital and robust partnerships.

Among the first signals from the summit, major multilateral development banks (MDBs) reaffirmed their commitment to accelerate and scale support for African countries through adaptation and resilience finance. While MDBs delivered a record $137 billion in climate finance last year, nearly 40% went to high-income countries and only about 30% to adaptation projects. Meanwhile, the African Development Bank has unveiled a suite of climate-finance tools to help nations transition to low-carbon economies and access large-scale funding, reflecting a growing emphasis on structured, bankable projects in Africa. These early actions highlight a central challenge: while adaptation, renewable energy and energy-access projects are critical, they often remain less attractive to private capital, slowing deployment where it is needed most.

Against this backdrop, COP30 has highlighted priorities for Africa’s energy investment, including decentralized renewable energy systems, storage-enabled solutions, resilient grid infrastructure and integration with local industrial and social development objectives. Early initiatives at the summit – particularly those linking energy access with smallholder agriculture and social protection – underscore the importance of projects that simultaneously address climate, energy and socioeconomic goals. At the “Africa Day” dialogue, ministers and development institutions emphasized the need to mobilize financing for renewable energy, infrastructure and climate-resilient solutions, while noting that many existing mechanisms remain insufficiently attractive to private investors, limiting project scale and impact. Notably, the launch of the Climate‑Resilient Social Protection and Smallholder Agriculture Finance Partnership, endorsed by 44 countries, highlighted the interconnected nature of climate action, energy access and poverty reduction. The implication for energy investment is clear: integrated models combining decentralized renewables, storage, agro-industrial linkages and local services are likely to deliver the greatest impact.

These insights from COP30 underscore the need for forums that translate priorities into actionable investment opportunities. The Invest in African Energy (IAE) Forum, scheduled for March 30-April 1, 2026 in Paris, provides such a platform, bridging the gap between ambition and execution. While COP30 highlights why Africa needs urgent investment – the scale of the challenge and the imperative for resilient, inclusive projects – the IAE Forum demonstrates how stakeholders can convert these insights into pipeline-ready opportunities. It brings together African governments, investors, development institutions and private sector actors to explore financing models, risk-mitigation structures and deal flow that support both energy access and climate objectives.

Discussions at COP30 have reinforced Africa’s dual imperative: expand universal energy access while building resilient, low-carbon systems. IAE 2026 facilitates this by connecting global investors with locally relevant opportunities – ranging from mini-grid and off-grid solutions to renewable generation, energy storage and local manufacturing of clean energy components. By highlighting replicable models and practical pathways to scale, the Forum bridges policy commitments and investment delivery, ensuring financing structures, instruments and partnerships translate ambition into measurable impact across sub-Saharan Africa.",https://aecweeks3.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14133351/cop30-image.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 05:58:09.433971

A new report estimates the impacts,"Alejandro Lazo, www.ijpr.org, alejandro-lazo-calmatters",,,,,https://www.ijpr.org/environment-energy-and-transportation/2025-11-14/data-centers-are-putting-new-strain-on-californias-grid-a-new-report-estimates-the-impacts,"California is a major hub for data centers — the facilities that store and transmit much of the internet.
DataCenterMap, a commercial directory that tracks data centers worldwide, lists 321 sites across the state.
But the authors say their findings underscore the need for uniform reporting standards for data centers’ energy and water use.
The report said California should establish ongoing local monitoring and review of data centers — and make the findings public.
Ren, the UC Riverside researcher, said that California’s cleaner grid and stricter pollution rules are helping blunt some environmental impacts of data centers already.","California is a major hub for data centers — the facilities that store and transmit much of the internet. But just how much these power-hungry operations affect the state’s energy use, climate and public health remains an open question for researchers.

A new report released this week by the environmental think tank Next 10 and a UC Riverside researcher attempts to quantify that impact — but its authors say the report is only an estimate without harder data from the centers themselves.

“We are just making these reports pretty much in the dark — since there’s almost zero information,” said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside and co-author of the report. “We have extremely little information about data centers in California.”

Ren and his coauthors conclude that between 2019 and 2023, electricity use and carbon emissions by California data centers nearly doubled, while on-site water consumption slightly more than doubled. Much of the increases were attributable to the electricity required to run artificial intelligence computations. But many of the report’s estimates, including its health impacts, are based on limited data — a key issue researchers said they encountered repeatedly when crafting the report.

The report underscores a growing tension in the industry: advocates who support clean energy and experts who study energy demand agree the days of steady, flat energy use at data centers are over, but there’s far less consensus on just how sharply electricity demand will climb.

“In very simple terms, a lot of the uncertainty comes from: what is our life going to look like with AI in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years — how integrated is it going to become?” said Maia Leroy, a Sacramento-based advocate who focuses on clean energy and the grid. “Are we reaching a point where the use is going to plateau, or is it going to continue?”

Experts say more transparency is essential to better understand what resources data centers demand in California.

Liang Min, who manages the Bits and Watts Initiative at Stanford University, says the state should improve its forecasts for energy demand to support clean energy goals. Min, who investigates AI’s growing strain on the electric grid, told CalMatters that demand at power centers rises in rapid, unpredictable phases and can shift quickly with each new generation of hardware.

The California Energy Commission, which plans for energy use and the growth in demand, “can play a pivotal role,” in understanding and adapting to the demands of AI.

As demand grows, policy responses lag

In Sacramento, efforts to add transparency and guardrails around data centers have struggled this year. California lawmakers shelved most consumer and environmental proposals aimed at data centers, even as they approved a plan to regionalize California’s power grid to help meet demand from the sector. They set aside two bills focused on curbing data centers’ energy use — one requiring operators to disclose their electricity use and another that offered clean power incentives.

Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a separate proposal that would have required data center operators to report their water use, even after the bill was weakened. In the end, Newsom — who has often highlighted California’s dominance in the artificial intelligence sector — signed only one measure, allowing regulators to determine whether data centers are driving up costs.

Mark Toney, who leads The Utility Reform Network and supported the transparency measure, has questioned whether data centers justify the costs they’re pushing onto ratepayers.

He warned of the centers’ “voracious consumption of energy and water, increased carbon emissions, and jacking up ratepayer bills.”

Hard facts about data centers are tough to find in California because most rent out power, cooling and floor space to other companies, said Ren, the UC Riverside researcher. Such colocation facilities don’t run their own servers or technology, so they report less information publicly than data centers built by major tech companies in other states.

While estimates vary, California has the third-most data centers in the country, after Texas and Virginia. DataCenterMap, a commercial directory that tracks data centers worldwide, lists 321 sites across the state. More in California are expected in coming years.

The centers operate around the clock and often rely on diesel backup generators to maintain service during power failures — a practice that adds both greenhouse gases and local air pollutants. They also consume energy and water depending on their cooling methods.

Rising data-center demand, and rising questions

F. Noel Perry, the businessman and philanthropist who founded Next 10, said his organization’s report shines light on what is fundamentally a black box. “To solve a problem, we have to understand what the problem is,” he said.

“We’ve seen the proliferation of data centers in California, in the U.S. and across the world — and we also are seeing major implications for the environment,” Perry told CalMatters. “The real issue has to do with transparency — and the ability of elected officials and regulators to create some rules that will govern reductions in emissions, water consumption.”

The report estimated that data centers used 10.8 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023, up from 5.5 terawatt-hours in 2019, accounting for 6% of the nation’s total data center energy use. Unless growth is curbed or better managed, the report’s authors project demand could rise to as high as 25 terawatt-hours by 2028, equal to the power use of roughly 2.4 million U.S. homes.

Carbon emissions from the sector nearly doubled during the same period, climbing from 1.2 million to 2.4 million tons, researchers estimated, while on site water use grew from 1,078 acre feet in 2019 to 2,302 acre feet in 2023. That’s enough to meet the annual water needs of almost seven thousand California households.

The report’s authors also estimated the public health costs from air pollution associated with data centers have potentially risen, from $45 million in 2019 to more than $155 million in 2023, with the burden expected to reach as high as $266 million by 2028.

Most of those costs stem from indirect pollution produced by fossil-fueled power plants that supply the grid. But authors pointed out that regions dense with data centers — particularly Santa Clara County, home to Silicon Valley — could face higher localized risks from diesel backup generators.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, said the report exaggerates the impact of backup diesel generators, which are tightly regulated and rarely used in California, minimizing their contributions to air pollution. Data centers don’t control the water used in electricity generation, said Diorio. Since those water impacts don’t happen on site, it’s not fair to blame that on the centers themselves.

“It paints a skewed picture of this critical 21st-century industry,” Diorio said in a statement.

Diorio said the report also overlooks how cooling technology varies by region and has become more efficient in recent years.

But the authors say their findings underscore the need for uniform reporting standards for data centers’ energy and water use. The report said California should establish ongoing local monitoring and review of data centers — and make the findings public.

Company officials said pairing energy supply with data center load can reduce transmission strain and improve long-term grid planning.
Colleges across the state — including UT, Texas A&M, Texas State, Dallas College and South Texas College — are part of Google’s AI for Education Accelerator, which provides free AI training and career certificates to students and faculty.","Google announced it will invest $40 billion in Texas through 2027, adding three new data center campuses and launching major energy, water and workforce programs as the state strengthens its role as one of the nation’s fastest-growing centers for artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The announcement came Friday during a community event in Midlothian attended by federal, state and local leaders. The investment — Google’s largest in any state — includes a new data center campus in Armstrong County, two in Haskell County, and continued buildout of the company’s Ellis County facilities and Dallas cloud region.

“This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state,” Gov. Greg Abbott said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Texas has become a key location for next-generation computing. “Texas offers the right combination of energy, workforce and innovation,” Pichai said. “This investment will bring new data center campuses online, support thousands of jobs and help power the next era of AI development.”

Rural counties shift into the tech spotlight

The Panhandle and West Texas campuses bring major technology investment to rural areas traditionally known for agriculture and energy. Local leaders said the projects will diversify their economies and provide long-term jobs.

Armstrong County Judge Adam Ensey called Google’s investment “a generational opportunity” that places the region at the edge of the global digital economy. Haskell County Judge Kenny Thompson said the new campuses will strengthen infrastructure and create “top-tier employment opportunities” for residents.

Google is joining a growing cluster of high-density computing projects in the region.

Armstrong County commissioners recently approved an amendment to Crusoe Energy’s tax abatement agreement for a 3.5 million-square-foot AI data center complex south of Claude. Four buildings are currently under construction off Lima Road east of Highway 207 and could be completed within two years, according to company spokesman Tyler Hunt. Under the revised abatement, the county will receive $1.35 million per building per year, once each becomes operational, which could produce earlier revenue for the county beginning in 2026. Hunt said at the time that the company was negotiating with a tenant but did not yet have a final commitment.

Judge Ensey said the Crusoe structure benefits the county by tying payments to individual buildings as they come online rather than waiting for multiple phases to be completed. He also noted Armstrong County officials are tracking other regional developments, including Fermi America’s proposed 18 million-square-foot AI data center and energy campus in neighboring Carson County.

Part of a statewide data center boom

Texas has seen rapid growth in hyperscale data centers as companies seek land, renewable energy and access to the ERCOT grid. Google recently opened the first building at its Red Oak campus in Ellis County and continues expanding its Midlothian site and Dallas cloud region — part of the company’s global network of 42 cloud regions.

Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly said the projects reflect the United States’ effort to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence. “This investment strengthens America’s AI competitiveness while helping keep energy reliable and affordable,” Danly said.

Energy planners say the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure is expected to increase statewide power demand, prompting closer coordination between developers and ERCOT.

State leaders, including Sen. John Cornyn, said the expansion will support national competitiveness in AI and cybersecurity.

Energy plans shaped around high-power AI needs

Google outlined several energy commitments to support the electricity demands of AI computing:

More than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power purchase agreements with developers including AES, Enel, Clearway and Ørsted.

A co-located solar and battery storage project at one of the Haskell County campuses, developed with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate, designed to align on-site clean energy with heavy compute loads.

A $30 million Energy Impact Fund, beginning in 2026, to support local weatherization, energy efficiency upgrades and workforce development.

Company officials said pairing energy supply with data center load can reduce transmission strain and improve long-term grid planning.

Water and environmental commitments

Google said its new Texas campuses will use advanced air-cooling systems that significantly reduce water use, limiting consumption to non-computing needs such as kitchens and employee facilities.

The company also announced:

$2.6 million to Texas Water Trade to restore up to 1,000 acres of wetlands in the Trinity–San Jacinto Estuary, delivering about 300 million gallons of freshwater annually.

More than $2 million for agricultural programs, including regenerative farming efforts in North Texas and irrigation-efficiency projects in the High Plains.

Preparing Texas workers for AI-era jobs

To meet rising demand for electricians and data center technicians, Google partnered with the electrical training ALLIANCE to train more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, supported by Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund.

The company also committed $7 million for AI-related initiatives in healthcare, energy and education. Funding includes support for rural health outreach through CareMessage, energy research at the University of Texas and Texas Tech University, and AI-skills programs at Houston Community College.

Colleges across the state — including UT, Texas A&M, Texas State, Dallas College and South Texas College — are part of Google’s AI for Education Accelerator, which provides free AI training and career certificates to students and faculty.

Texas’ digital landscape continues to shift

Local officials said Google’s expansion — combined with active construction by Crusoe Energy in Armstrong County and the proposed Fermi America project in Carson County — reflects how the Panhandle and West Texas are becoming a significant cluster for AI and cloud-computing infrastructure.

Midlothian Mayor Justin Coffman said Google’s presence has already shaped local economic development. “Their presence is a catalyst for long-term growth,” Coffman said.

“Our region has long powered America through agriculture and energy,” Ensey said. “Now it will help power the future of innovation.”","https://www.amarillo.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/14/NAGN/87279018007-47-a-1634.jpg?crop=7624,4289,x0,y398&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-14 21:04:52.251062

And PM2.5 isn’t the only pollutant associated with coal power plants.
Robust data shows that people living near coal power plants face higher rates of hospitalization, chronic lung disease, and premature deaths.
Fortunately, as coal plants have shuttered, researchers have noted a decrease in associated mortality rates, meaning these deaths can be prevented.
Beyond the health burdens, economic costs and legal concerns around the order, Campbell is also inefficient.","Joining a slew of retired coal power plants in the state, the JH Campbell Generating Plant’s planned closure in West Olive was meant to signal the beginning of a new era — one where our energy needs can be met by cleaner, more sustainable means.

But just a week before Campbell was supposed to power down, the US Department of Energy issued an emergency order on May 23 to Consumers Energy to keep the plant online. With another extension on the horizon, it’s unclear how long the Campbell plant will be caught in limbo.

As long as Campbell and other coal-fired power plants keep polluting the air, Michiganders will continue to suffer immediate and long-term health consequences.

Most coverage has focused on the financial cost to ratepayers — including more than $80 million Consumers spent to keep Campbell running from May to September. But the human toll of coal is beyond economic comprehension, contributing to overburdened health care systems, sick children, and preventable, premature deaths.

Representing more than 400 Michigan health professionals, we at the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action (MiCCA) know from a vast body of literature that coal-burning power plants are a major source of fine particulate matter air pollution.

Airborne particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter — known as PM2.5 — are imperceptible to the human eye. The smaller the particles, the greater the health risk, as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. PM2.5 exposure is linked to a myriad of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues.

Many industrial activities emit PM2.5, including vehicle tailpipe emissions and the combustion of oil and natural gas. These sources are a significant concern for clinicians in our network, but coal pollution is especially harmful to public health.

In a 2023 study published in Science, researchers found that PM2.5 from coal was associated with a 2.1-times greater risk of death than other sources of air pollution. Using emissions and Medicare data, the study’s authors also found that 460,000 deaths in the US were attributable to coal-related PM2.5 from 1999 to 2020.

And PM2.5 isn’t the only pollutant associated with coal power plants. Nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and heavy metals like mercury, lead and arsenic are all linked to coal-fired generation.

Robust data shows that people living near coal power plants face higher rates of hospitalization, chronic lung disease, and premature deaths. Pregnant women are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight, and research suggests that exposure to coal ash can harm children’s cognitive development.

Fortunately, as coal plants have shuttered, researchers have noted a decrease in associated mortality rates, meaning these deaths can be prevented. Trips to the emergency department and hospitalizations for lung-related causes have dropped, too.

The misguided order to keep Campbell operational also comes amid a number of proposed federal rollbacks that would weaken regulations on several public health measures, including the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which limit emissions of hazardous pollutants from power plants.

Beyond the health burdens, economic costs and legal concerns around the order, Campbell is also inefficient. In legal filings challenging the order, environmental groups detailed how even during the summer’s highest demand day, the regional grid operator had a surplus of energy.

Actions that rescind environmental protections and force the continued operation of dirty coal are shortsighted and threaten to reverse decades of public health progress.

As health professionals, we cannot understate the importance of having affordable and reliable energy. But there is no evidence-based justification for prolonging a technology that is no longer necessary to meet our energy needs and causes undue harm to our most vulnerable communities.

We hope Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel will continue to fight this irrational order, and we call on the US Department of Energy to end this political theater and leave coal in the 20th century, where it belongs.

Saudi Aramco is shaking up the global gas market, locking in long-term US LNG supply agreements and a multibillion-dollar stake in a Louisiana project as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince heads to Washington.

What does this mean?

Long dominant in oil, Saudi Aramco is now pivoting heavily into liquefied natural gas. The company is set to acquire a stake in Woodside Energy’s $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG facility, securing up to 2 million tons of LNG annually. It’s also in talks for another 2 million tons each year from Commonwealth LNG’s proposed Cameron, Louisiana plant. With these deals, Aramco aims to multiply its global LNG footprint from 4.5 million tons currently under development to a target of 20 million tons per year. While none of the companies have issued official statements, this aggressive push reflects rising LNG demand worldwide—especially in Asia and Europe—as buyers look for stable supply and US exports become more dominant.

Why should I care?

For markets: The US steps into the LNG driver’s seat.

With the US on course to claim the global top spot for LNG exports, these massive deals put Louisiana center stage for the industry’s expansion. The billions flowing into Woodside’s project alone show strong conviction in higher long-term demand, while major players jockey for a secure foothold in the evolving LNG landscape. Investors will be watching how these moves influence LNG prices, trade patterns, and corporate strategies as the sector heats up.

PHILADELPHIA - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today announced the award of a grant of $45,000 to the Baltimore Development Corporation under the Smart Growth: Saving Open Space, Revitalizing Brownfields program. The grant will support the establishment of “Smart Sites,” a program to market brownfield sites to potential developers.

Brownfields are abandoned industrial and commercial properties where contamination has been a barrier to expansion or redevelopment.

“Smart Sites will make things easier for those interested in developing a brownfields site in Baltimore by streamlining permit and approval procedures, and identifying a single point of contact within government to assist the developer,” said Donald S. Welsh, administrator for EPA’s mid-Atlantic region.

.

Through “Smart Sites,” state and city governments will promote sites that have been identified as development priorities. The program will target sites most likely to create smart growth projects, considering the potential for a mix of uses and proximity to public transit.

Promotion of brownfields development encourages land recycling, while reducing development pressure on greenfield sites. This helps protect air and water quality by reducing the amount of vehicle miles traveled and the amount of land paved over by greenfield development. The “Smart Sites” approach, which includes a website to publicize financial incentives for developing brownfields, will also serve as a model for other communities of how to inventory, manage, and promote the reuse of brownfield sites.

EPA’s “Smart Growth: Saving Open Space, Revitalizing Brownfields” grant program is an important component of EPA Administrator Whitman’s “Open Space Preservation Strategies for Promoting Smarter Growth and Environmental Preservation” initiative. Announced Jan. 24, 2002, this initiative recognizes the critical importance of linking open space preservation and Brownfield redevelopment through a smart growth approach to achieve better environmental protection. In addition to the grants, the initiative provides technical assistance to states and communities to prioritize open space for preservation.

Budget 2025, p 347.
Budget 2025, p 351.
Budget 2025, p 349.","On November 4, 2025 (""Budget Day 25"") the Federal Government tabled Budget 2025.1 As part of Budget 2025, the Government introduced several tax measures, including proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the ""Tax Act""), aimed at maintaining Canada's role as a global leader in the critical minerals space and continuing its journey to a net-zero economy. These measures are summarized below.

Extension of Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

Budget 2025 confirms the Government's intention, originally announced on March 3, 2025, to extend availability of the 15% mineral exploration tax credit (the ""METC"") available to subscribers of flow-through shares in resource issuers undertaking certain grassroots exploration activities.2 Under the current legislation, the METC would not apply to flow-through share agreements entered into after March 31, 2025, so confirmation that the Government intends to proceed with the extension, as previously announced, is welcome.

Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (""CMETC"") is a 30% tax credit available to investors who subscribe for flow-through shares in mining companies that explore for certain critical minerals. The list of eligible critical minerals currently includes copper, nickel, lithium (including lithium from brines), cobalt, graphite, rare earth elements, scandium, titanium, gallium, vanadium, tellurium, magnesium, zinc, platinum group metals, and uranium.

Budget 2025 proposes that the list of eligible critical minerals be expanded to include bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten.3 The proposed expansion of the eligible critical minerals list would apply to investments in flow-through shares issued under agreements entered into after Budget Day 25 and on or before March 31, 2027.4

Canadian Exploration Expense

Canada's flow-through share regime generally permits principal business corporations to renounce to subscribers of flow-through shares certain qualified expenditures incurred in the exploration phase of a mineral project's life. Expenditures capable of such renunciation must constitute ""Canadian exploration expenses"" (""CEE"") as defined in the Tax Act, and generally constitute expenses incurred for the purpose of determining the existence, location, extent or quality of a mineral resource in Canada.

Budget 2025 proposes to amend the definition of CEE to clarify that expenses related to determining economic viability or engineering feasibility of a mineral resource do not constitute CEE and are therefore not capable of renunciation pursuant to a flow-through share agreement.5 This amendment is effective as of Budget Day 25.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit

The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (""CE ITC""), which is a 15% refundable tax credit (reduced to 5% in certain circumstances) in respect of the capital cost of eligible property and equipment used in the generation, storage and transmission of electricity, was first proposed in Budget 2023. Budget 2024 contained further details regarding the design and implementation of the program, proposed to be available in respect of new (i.e., not previously used) eligible property and equipment acquired and available for use on or after April 16, 2024 and before 2035, but the program has not yet been enacted. Budget 2024 restricted availability of the CE ITC to Canadian corporations, certain provincial and territorial Crown corporations, corporations owned by municipalities, corporations owned by Indigenous communities, pension investment corporations, and certain tax-exempt Canadian corporations.

Budget 2025 proposes that the Canada Growth Fund be expressly included as an entity eligible for the CE ITC, effective as of Budget Day 25.6 Additionally, recognizing that the Canada Growth Fund may act as an investor in other eligible entities, Budget 2025 proposes that financing provided by the Canada Growth Fund would not reduce an eligible entity's cost of property for purposes of computing entitlement to the CE ITC.7

Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit

The Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit (""CTM ITC)"" is a 30% refundable tax credit in respect of the capital cost of eligible property and equipment used in the manufacture of renewable energy equipment (e.g., equipment used to manufacture solar, wind, water or geothermal equipment) or the extraction and processing of certain critical minerals (lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements and graphite).

Budget 2025 proposes to expand eligibility for the CTM ITC to support polymetallic extraction and processing by adding to the list of eligible critical minerals the following: antimony, gallium, germanium, indium and scandium.8 The expanded list will apply in respect of property that is acquired and becomes available for use on or after Budget Day 25.

Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Investment Tax Credit

The carbon capture, utilization and storage investment tax credit (""CCUS ITC"") is a refundable tax credit in respect of the capital cost of certain eligible equipment utilized in the capture, utilization and storage of carbon. The rate of the credit ranges from 37.5% to 60% depending on the particular use of the eligible equipment. Under the current legislation, the CCUS ITC is available in respect of expenditures incurred prior to 2041, but the applicable rate of the CCUS ITC gradually decreases between 2031 and the end of 2040.

Budget 2025 proposes to delay the onset of reduced credit rates by five years such that the current full rates will apply to expenditures until the end of 2035 and the reduced rates would begin to take effect thereafter.9

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I) held a press call this morning from Belém, where he is serving as the entirety of the U.S. Congressional delegation. In his opening remarks, the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee outlined four key messages that will guide his engagement at COP. First, he said that the Trump Administration represents the will of the fossil fuel industry rather than the will of the American people on climate issues. Second, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is our last “lifeboat” for climate safety. Third, economic shocks of the climate crisis are occurring, including an insurance crisis that is spreading across the U.S. And finally, the fossil fuel industry is the villain in this story of climate action.

EESI Article: “Trade in the Age of Climate Change: The Role of a U.S. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism”

Shipshow: Sen. Whitehouse said that one goal for his engagement at COP30 will be protecting CBAM from what happened to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Net-Zero Framework—a U.S.-led campaign that paused the process for a year, which Whitehouse described as a “thuggish battering.” The internationally-supported landmark IMO proposal would establish a marine fuel standard and impose an emissions fee on the global shipping industry.

EESI Briefing: International Trade and Climate Policy

We Cannot Afford Fossil Fuels: Sen. Whitehouse was also asked if he agrees with Bill Gates’s controversial memo, which urged the climate community to shift its focus from rising temperatures to poverty and disease. Contrasting Gates, he instead proposed a new approach that connects fossil fuel “mischief” to the affordability crisis facing American consumers. Sen. Whitehouse added that innovation will never solve the climate crisis so long as the government continues to subsidize the fossil fuel industry.

EESI Fact Sheet: Proposals to Reduce Fossil Fuel Subsidies

Polluter Presence: Kick Big Polluters Out, a global network of more than 450 organizations, reported that more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists are present at COP30. This is the largest proportion—one in every 25 attendees in Belém—in UNFCCC history. COP30 is also operating under new rules dictating that nongovernment observers must disclose their funding sources and institutional ties. However, this rule does not apply to government delegations, which account for 160 of the 1,600 lobbyists. Larry Rousseau of the Canadian Labour Congress remarked that “this is not what meaningful participation looks like .… If we are serious about an ‘implementation COP,’ if we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we must be serious about protecting these negotiations from the vested interests that profit from delay.”

Drivers of Change: A new declaration on transportation decarbonization and resilience responds to a lack of specific global action on transportation emissions and calls for a shared framework with measurable goals and indicators to monitor progress. It also calls for a “just, inclusive, and tailored” transition; accordingly, the contributions of each participating country will be commensurate with the “differing capacities and realities” of developing countries. The declaration, co-led by Chile and Brazil, has so far been signed by Austria, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. At a press event for the declaration, one Chilean transportation minister touted an 8.5% improvement in efficiency standards for light-duty vehicles, and success in deploying 4,400 electric buses in Santiago. Meanwhile, a representative from the Dominican Republic reported success in meeting the country’s 2020 NDC to build out its capital’s metro system.

Resilience Stats: Race to Resilience, an initiative of the High-level Climate Champions, released its 2025 progress report. During his opening remarks, Chile’s COP25 High-Level Champion Gonzalo Muñoz highlighted the initiative’s accomplishments: 437 million people have been touched by resilience work, 18.4 million hectares of ecosystems in 78 countries have been conserved, and $4.2 billion in adaptation finance has been deployed. Muñoz underscored that the insurance sector has immense ability to accelerate progress. “Insurance companies know that they need to provide new conditions for business to thrive and for governments to be more stable … Race to Resilience can provide the link of the insurance sector to all of the other sectors of the economy to generate the conditions that we require for being resilient.”

EESI Briefing: Risky Business: Insurance in the Era of Climate Change

Women Leading Towards a Net-Zero Future: A session at the We Don’t Have Time studio highlighted inclusive leadership by women who are shaping business and climate policy. We Mean Business Coalition CEO María Mendiluce shared that moving to net zero is not easy, but that when women take the lead on climate, positive change happens through collaboration. “Change is not linear, it’s exponential,” she said. Kerry Constabile, director of decarbonization strategy at Amazon, added that successful business strategies for net zero should focus on collective action over silos or competition. For women leaders specifically, Constabile highlighted the importance of mentorship.

A Win-Win-Win for Climate, Health, and Justice: A UNFCCC side event hosted by the World Health Organization and the United Nations University spotlighted the intersectional approach to climate, health, and justice through the lens of two major breakthroughs: the Belém Health Action Plan, which was released yesterday, and the International Court of Justice’s July decision that states are obligated to protect people from climate harm. This event also featured the release of two special reports supporting the Belém Health Action Plan: one that compiles evidence underpinning the plan, and another that offers guidance on social participation to strengthen the plan’s implementation.

Data Center Discourse: A press conference held by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) focused on artificial intelligence data center infrastructure and the associated climate costs. Jean Su, director of the CBD Energy Justice Program, pointed out that the U.S. consumes more energy from data centers than anywhere else in the world, with dangerous consequences for environmental justice. Speaking on the situation in Brazil, Cynthia Picolo from the Laboratory of Public Policy and Internet shared that the country’s policy framework has been designed to streamline data center development without public input or socio-environmental considerations. Su and her fellow panelists proposed guardrails through the UNFCCC, such as the disclosure of national data center emissions in future NDCs.

City staff briefed the committee on recent federal policy changes that narrow funding and regulatory tools local governments expected to use for climate and electrification work. ""The scaling back of clean energy and electrification incentives was a major shift,"" a staff presenter said, listing reduced production and investment tax credits, cuts to consumer rebates and termination of programs such as the EPA’s Solar for All.

Members and staff discussed how those federal shifts translate to state and local effects. An attendee from the state energy forum reported that the Oregon 'homes' electrification programs remain funded and are moving toward a 2026 implementation timeline, but several Inflation Reduction Act and competitive grant opportunities have largely been exhausted. ""Those funds were already allocated,"" a participant said of state-level programs obligated to proceed.

Committee members flagged administrative actions that could also affect local work, including proposed changes to the EPA endangerment finding and revocation of the Clean Air Act waiver that underpins stricter state vehicle standards. Staff noted the City of Bend filed public comments opposing any rescission of the endangerment finding.

Discussion covered strategic responses: members suggested building coalitions with other cities, targeted advocacy to protect obligated programs, and profiling local infrastructure projects (for example, wastewater treatment upgrades linked to climate-driven costs) to communicate state and federal impacts to elected officials.

Next steps: the committee and staff will monitor federal and state program rollouts, continue coalition participation, and identify policy and funding opportunities to prioritize under a tighter resource environment.

This LCRA power plant will help us both meet the needs of today and prepare our grid for the future.”

Under the grant agreement, LCRA will be eligible to receive a maximum total grant award of $22.56 million for the project, Timmerman Power Plant Unit 1. This grant may be paid in annual payments of up to $2.256 million per year, over a 10-year period.

Annual payments are contingent upon the performance of the power plant. Performance is measured by ERCOT during an annual “test period” and compared to the performance of a reference group of other generation resources in the ERCOT region.

Specific performance metrics are outlined in the PUCT’s CBG rule. Timmerman Power Plant Unit 1’s first test period will run June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2027, after which LCRA may receive its first grant payment, the PUC said.

Timmerman Power Plant Unit 1 is a natural gas power plant, capable of starting within 45 seconds and reaching full capacity within five minutes. It connected to the ERCOT grid on August 14, 2025.

The TxEF CBG Program is one of four TxEF programs.

Energy Transfer Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Energy Transfer, you need to believe in a world where natural gas remains a vital bridge fuel for power generation and data infrastructure, underpinned by long-term contracts with top-tier customers. The recently announced 20-year agreement with Entergy Louisiana reinforces Energy Transfer's ties to fast-growing digital demand but does not materially alter the most immediate catalyst: the successful delivery and ramp-up of large-capacity pipeline projects, nor does it offset the core risk of execution delays and volume shortfalls in key basins.

Recent news about the new Midland Basin processing plant, expected online in late 2026, stands out as directly relevant. This facility complements the long-haul transportation commitments and supports Energy Transfer’s push to reliably meet the surging demand for natural gas tied to both new power plants and hyperscale data center clients, reinforcing near-term growth catalysts while putting additional pressure on execution. The real challenge, however, is the risk of construction delays or cost overruns, which investors should be aware of because...

Energy Transfer's outlook anticipates $99.8 billion in revenue and $6.7 billion in earnings by 2028. Achieving this requires annual revenue growth of 7.4% and a $2.2 billion increase in earnings from the current $4.5 billion.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause new California laws expected to require thousands of companies to report emissions and climate-risk information.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.",https://www.wbtw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/11/NuclearWDCWNexstar.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 03:58:22.152144

THE DETAILS

Kimmeridge owned 5.66 million shares in Devon as of the end of September, the filing said. That would equate to an approximately 0.9% stake in Devon, according to Reuters calculations, and make it Devon’s 14th-largest shareholder, according to data provider LSEG. Devon shares fell 1% in the opening 30 minutes of trading on Friday, amid a broader market sell-off, giving the company a market value of around $22 billion.

The 13F filing from Kimmeridge did not detail anything beyond the number of shares held at the end of the third quarter, and whether Kimmeridge has since increased or decreased its position. The filing came at the deadline for investment firms to reveal their holdings in public companies as of September 30.

When approached by Reuters, Kimmeridge declined comment. Devon did not respond to a comment request.

THE PLAYERS

Oklahoma City-based Devon is one of the larger independent U.S. shale producers, with operations in multiple formations including the Delaware portion of the Permian basin covering Texas and New Mexico, the Eagle Ford of South Texas and Oklahoma’s Anadarko basin.

The company’s shares have gained 4% year to date, in line with the performance of the S&P Energy index.

Among the best-known activists within the oil and gas industry, Kimmeridge has in recent years pushed energy companies for better governance practices, prioritizing shareholder returns over expansive drilling programs, and consolidation to achieve economies of scale. Kimmeridge said on November 4 it owned a stake in Devon peer Coterra Energy, and was pushing for leadership changes and the sale of its Appalachia and Oklahoma operations to focus on Coterra’s Delaware basin holding.
